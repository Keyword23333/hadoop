6280000 it is the poorly prosecuted patents that have problems and end up in litigation
6280001 has allowed us to differentiate ourselves from general practice firms
6280002 a boutique that handles a clients patent prosecution becomes steeped in knowledge of the clients products its competitors and its future
6280003 you just cant fake the technology know how needed for these tasks
6280004 sophisticated clients see through this and direct the work to attorneys who they know are tops in their respective fields which in many cases are attorneys at boutiques
6280005 no matter what the outcome the general counsel can tell the ceo who in turn can tell the shareholders they hired the biggest name available
6280006 venture capitalists are wowed by big names so if a particular technology looks like startup material we need a firm thats recognized and can do more than ip
6280007 gavin newsom is the most interesting and intelligent new face in california politics since i moved here in 1991 and maybe in the last three decades
6280008 he is bold and fearless and does big things im delighted to bring my gubernatorial campaign experience to his race for governor
6280009 we have a point on the board well take that as a positive and move on
6280010 theres nothing really to be said for myself other than keep your head up which you say to everybody that was the message to the whole group really
6280011 andrew is a terrific free kicker also in corners this is not the first one he scored
6280012 i think there was some luck but it was not surprising he scored because he practises a lot it was not by accident
6280013 we had them on their heels and unfortunately we kind of let them off
6280014 before i didnt like what i saw they play only by long ball long ball now they put the ball down and try thats beautiful to see football in a country like canada improve like that
6280015 teams go on the road to get a result and i think thats what jamaica did
6280016 they came here with a plan which was to get everybody back in behind the ball
6280017 we just wanted to go out there and make jamaicans proud also and make ourselves proud
6280018 its a better start than we had the last two times
6280019 and i think its the same start as we had in 86 when we qualified thats what we told the players after and i think if we play five more games like that well have a chance in every single game
6280020 this season shows that you should never give up there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points said the finn
6280021 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently
6280022 from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the fewer there are the more important they become
6280023 i think the championship will be very tight but i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race this is the sole aim the rest is just details
6280024 we need to score a decent return of points whenever we can and be consistent and as competitive as we can
6280025 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions said hamilton
6280026 thats made getting strong results even more important so i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
6280027 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and were confident well be competitive this weekend
6280028 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
6280029 ive only seen the new track from an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit said raikkonen
6280030 i always love to drive on new tracks and im always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
6280031 it will be more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on qualifying will be extremely important although i think there are some possibilities to overtake
6280032 if its hot that will help ferrari like at montreal you also need a bit of luck
6280033 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team here at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me he said
6280034 going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
6280035 i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
6280036 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
6280037 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races
6280038 overall the businesses we owned for the full year recorded a 15 per cent increase in revenue and 16 per cent increase in earnings before interest and tax
6280039 the changes wont suddenly be obvious on a particular day or date but i continue to strongly believe that the results of progress made to date and the strategies being planned will deliver value to our shareholders and our customers
6280040 while retail markets are becoming more challenging as household budgets come under pressure and consumer confidence softens these actions are collectively designed to lay the foundations of change and a sustained improvement in performance

6280049 a key pillar of the u s strategy to pacify iraq is in danger of collapsing
6280050 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6280051 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida
6280052 if they disband us now i will tell you that history will show we will go bacck to zero i will not give up my weapons i will never give them up and i will carry my weapon again if it is useless to talk to the government i will be forced to carry my weapons and my pistol
6280053 what has been achieved is substantial but it is also reversible
6280054 first the sunni awakening which preceded the surge second the sadr cease fire third sectarian cleansing that left much of baghdad segregated with fewer targets to shoot or bomb these tactical gains are relative violence is now where it was in 2005 and spiking up again iraq is still incredibly dangerous and despite what the president says very far from normal and these gains are fragile awakening members frustrated at the governments refusal to integrate them into the national security forces could turn their guns back on us
6280055 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
6280056 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
6280057 to support the iraqi government in its battle with all outlaw groups thats a pretty expansive commitment
6280058 there is no iraqi government that we know of that will be in place a year from now half the government has walked out we want to normalize a government that really doesnt exist
6280059 given the fact that the maliki government doesnt represent a true coalition wont this agreement make it appear we are taking sides in the civil war especially when most iraqi parliamentarians have called for a withdrawal of troops
6280060 that over the past five years the united nations has continued to help the people of iraq and others throughout the world who suffer from violence disease and want

6280066 taha dria a shiite lawmaker from diyala who was not in the government compound during the raid said the armed forces were from iraqs emergency response unit an american trained unit similar to u s special forces
6280067 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
6280068 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense they have goals and they didnt inform anyone else
6280069 both men arrested are sunni muslims and the iraqi islamic party the largest sunni party in the country immediately condemned the raids as part of a sectarian campaign by the largely shiite muslim security forces

6280082 moreover we find that louisvilles housing market is performing well relative to most of the rest of the country homes here continue to appreciate in value albeit at a lower annual rate than earlier in the decade new home construction has slowed dramatically allowing time for home demand to catch up with home supply and louisville has a large inventory of modestly priced homes a very high percentage of homeowners who carry no mortgage debt and the lowest monthly housing rental rates of any of the 15 metropolitan areas typically used in comparison studies of louisville

6280089 as americans pay more than 4 for a gallon of gasoline and watch energy prices continue to climb higher and higher we need to be doing more to develop our own energy here at home through resources such as oil shale
6280090 instead i find it ironic that we are asking countries halfway around the world to produce more for us
6280091 this is a last ditch irresponsible attempt by the white house to issue commercial oil shale leases at colorados expense
6280092 these regulations would send bargain basement royalty rates that could cost coloradans billions of dollars
6280093 we dont know the impact on the potential health on humans might be we need to

6280095 a senior vet from taronga zoo examined the whale last night and while the whale is not distressed his condition has deteriorated as he hasnt fed in days
6280096 the plan today is to use an inflatable sling to try to get the whale further out to sea where he might hook up with another pod of whales
6280097 previously the whale was lured out to sea by following a yacht that it thought was its mother but then it turned around and came back in because i think it was still attached to the yacht
6280098 if we can get it into the sling we can get it further out to the ocean into deeper water and hopefully closer to another pod of whales

6280117 i never thought i was going to see him hit a home run as a manager if he starts swinging the bat obviously its going to be a dangerous lineup obviously every time juniors at the plate hes dangerous i think he can still swing the bat
6280118 everybody else does im more concerned about getting hits and getting on base you get hits and home runs happen but it is good to get the first one at home
6280119 pretty much everyone knows that growing up in a household where the dad ken sr is a professional baseball player the last thing you talk about is baseball so you understand history but you dont dwell on it because the father and son relationship is more important than the numbers

6280122 si los padres viven separados a la madre toca el cuidado de los hijos
6280123 no hay en la sociedad raz n alguna para sustentar dicha preferencia por sobre el padre
6280124 hay una cuesti n sociocultural detr s de esto y es que la madre siempre ha cumplido con el rol prioritario del cuidado de los hijos esto incluso en los pa ses desarrollados las cifras indican que aunque los padres tengan libertad para resolver la madre se queda con la tuici n
6280125 es una resistencia m s bien basada en el prejuicio que algo real la custodia compartida se da igual cuando la mujer sale de la casa al mundo laboral
6280126 si me preguntan ninguno de los dos proyectos naranjo y diputados me gusta pero si tuviera que elegir entre los dos me quedo con el del senador donde ambos deciden y la custodia compartida se presenta como una de las alternativas

6280134 hoewel die aantal wit mense in suid afrika aansienlik minder as in ander bevolkingsgroepe is is die kommerwekkende wel dat die aantal arm wit mense vanaf 1996 tot 2005 met 95 toegeneem het meer as in enige ander groep in die land
6280135 in 1996 was daar nagenoeg 98 000 arm wit mense in suid afrika di syfer het teen 2005 tot meer as 197 000 gestyg intussen toon helpende hand se verslag dat werkloosheid onder wit suid afrikaners vanaf 1994 tot 2005 met 150 toegeneem het

6280152 this is as close as we are going to come to an nba playoffs or the nfl playoffs and when the playoffs come on i watch
6280153 for us this is what the season comes down to you dont play golf for the money but when you hear 10 million you kind of think about that and what a nice gift that would be im looking at this house in dallas right now that i maybe cant afford so im putting some pressure on myself to go get that house
6280154 after the majors are done theres a little bit of a downfall
6280155 but with these playoffs and the tour championship its kicked it up and its made it a little bit more interesting not only for us but also for the fans out there
6280156 i knew when i didnt win the first event last year i was toast
6280157 i dont know how its going to play out and only time will tell but this year theres going to be a lot more movement in the standings guys cant take a week off there are so many points out there
6280158 when the playoffs were first presented to us as players they said you know if you qualify for the playoffs at no
6280159 in its second year theres a bit better understanding of what the fedexcup is and what it entails and how to win and who can win
6280160 although i dont think anybody really understands the points fully we just know that if you play well youre going to do well and thats all that really matters so i think the fedexcup is gaining a lot of traction with the players padraig harrington who just won the last two majors and would love to take a bunch of time off but he cares about the playoffs hes here i think that speaks to how credible these events have quickly become

6280163 helpende hand het met skok verneem dat die skenkings wat deur die wvp in zimbabwe versprei word nie behoeftige wit bejaardes bereik nie di bejaardes is tot groot mate alleenlik van die zpo vir oorlewing afhanklik volgens die inligting wat die fonds ontvang het word sekere riglyne gebruik om te bepaal of hulpverlening gegee moet word helpende hand glo dat di benadering nie in die huidige krisissituasie in zimbabwe mag geld nie almal kry swaar en daarom behoort die hulp wat van nie politieke organisasie soos die wvp afkomstig is nie kleur te ken nie
6280164 in bykans elke dorp en stad het armoede aansienlik toegeneem en in die wit gemeenskappe het dieselfde verskynsel in die afgelope aantal jare meer en meer algemeen geword intussen word di behoeftiges op die randjies van die samelewing verstoot en in baie gevalle word hul lyding in stilte voortgesit
6280165 die optrede van die departement strook glad nie met die uiteensetting wat die nasionale departement van onderwys in hul vyfjaarplan vir onderwys gedoen het nie ingevolge daarvan is spesiale skole as afdeling beskou wat voorheen baie afgeskeep is in terme van voldoende finansiering ingevolge die plan moet nuwe beleide geskep word om di skole op te hef die teendeel gebeur egter tans by meerhof
6280166 luidens 2001 statistiek van die departement van onderwys is daar nagenoeg 380 spesiale skole vir die nagenoeg 65 000 leerders met spesiale onderrigbehoeftes hoewel daar na raming tot soveel as 280 000 leerders met spesiale onderwysbehoeftes is wat nie tans in spesiale skole geakkommodeer word nie
6280167 die syfers is klinkklare bewys dat die departement van onderwys geensins kan bekostig dat skool soos meerhof wat reeds vir meer as 60 jaar bestaan verlore gaan nie

6280198 or at least the cloth should be confined to one part of the body
6280199 an all denim outfit always seems rather coarse it awakens associations of cowboys and construction workers
6280200 take only as much as you would like to eat
6280201 we probably have three times the coffee in ours that they do
6280202 i think its clear to say that over the past few years certainly in the research we have done the whole movement is from alcoholic beverages and fast food to cafes
6280203 out of all the sites that starbucks has got there are only one or two that are making any money
6280204 starbucks serves up fairly indifferent coffee but at least you know what you are getting
6280205 australia with its history of european immigration was always going to be a test
6280206 starbucks has trying to sell a watered down product in one of the most sophisticated and lively coffee markets in the world
6280207 the customer will be certain that the person behind the machine knows exactly what they are doing
6280208 we see a lot more value in meditation than in massages or wellness packs when meditating you are active which is the opposite of most other wellness applications
6280209 yoga is not only about moving the body but is also a form of self recognition that integrates breathing and body awareness with the intellect or spirit of the body
6280210 in yoga we train the physical condition for meditation through asanas which is a yoga body position
6280211 in the end the point is to let everything go
6280212 meditation is something that when starting out you just have to get used to but its not something you should feel forced to do
6280213 i can understand the essence of life within two minutes or i can take 20 years or more and still not understand
6280214 while presidents have issued signing statements for quite some time
6280215 78 percent of president bushs more than 150 signing statements have raised constitutional or legal objections compared with only 18 of all of president clintons
6280216 it seems there is may be no safe level of arsenic
6280217 as water becomes a scarce resource we need additional sources
6280218 theres a lot of interest but at the same time its danish there are the cartoons
6280219 its not about being blasphemous though its about things that make both sides have a laugh thats more difficult than being provocative
6280220 the seasons are changing tremendously you can no longer say winter is in november december or march it falls in other months sometimes
6280221 producers can no longer make well laid plans calculations are not the same
6280222 there is a 1 1 million carbon equivalent tonnes per annum reduction as a result of this mill
6280223 pulp mill impacts of climate change at least 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year and these are conservative figures
6280224 overall people have been calling and saying john mccain did an outstanding job
6280225 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president
6280226 mccain was so incredibly decisive and he was so clear in his answers there was no gray area
6280227 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6280228 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking
6280229 thats why i will set out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
6280230 i bought an electric moped which i think is the technology of the future i got rid of the leaders car shortly after i got in
6280231 something very big is going on particularly in urban britain
6280232 out of the 30 british cities we now lead 12 that has been going on for years that is where the great battlegrounds will be between ourselves and labour at the next general election there are a lot of seats up for grabs in those areas
6280233 the conservatives think they deserve the keys to no 10 without having the decency to tell the voters what they would do if they got there
6280234 they have started to talk down to britain telling voters the votes in the bag
6280235 was writing of something he did not know about and it seemed to him that in a so called writer this is criminal
6280236 21 he talks to a sailor stationed on a sub who enjoys being on them because they offer all kinds of future
6280237 it looks as though the natural contentiousness of people has died
6280238 and suddenly i thought of that valley of the turkeys and wondered how i could have the gall to think turkeys stupid
6280239 do they find their emotional fair so bland that it must be laidened with sex and sadism through the medium of paperback
6280240 it seemed to me partly cautious and partly lack of interest but strong opinions were just not stated
6280241 oh sure hardly a day goes by that somebody doesnt take a belt at the russians
6280242 nobody can find fault with you if you take out after the russians
6280243 you think then we might be using russians as an outlet for something else other things
6280244 why i remember when people took everything out on mr roosevelt
6280245 it seemed to me that the frantic bustle of america was not in montana
6280246 it was only as i approached seattle that the unbelievable change became apparent
6280247 the vainest most slap happy and irreverent of men in the presence of redwoods goes under a spell of wonder and respect
6280248 if i thought he did it out of spite or to make a joke i said to myself id kill him out of hand
6280249 i printed once more on my eyes south west and north and then we hurried away from the permanent and changeless past where my mother is always shooting a wildcat and my father is always burning his name with his love
6280250 although people around the country are individuals certain customs and characteristics are similar
6280251 there are many customs that assimilate then into like minded people
6280252 the south is a place of hatred violence and bigotry
6280253 its the goddamn new york jews cause all the trouble
6280254 die kos en komberse bied ongelukkig slegs tydelike verligting aan arm mense dit is tyd dat ons die kringloop van armoede breek en die eerste stap is om die kinders wat daarin vasgevang is deur middel van opleiding beter toekoms te gee
6280255 ek doen beroep op mense om by die armoedeprobleem betrokke te raak borg kind wat andersins nie sou kon studeer nie om vir hom of haar blinker toekoms te help verseker
6280256 hundreds of pakistani civilians have been killed in suicide bombings over 1 000 pakistani troops have been killed fighting militants and musharraf himself has been the target of at least half a dozen assassination attempts
6280257 yet in pakistans tribal belt from where the helmand insurgency is being directed a new pakistani taliban now amasses suspected of the assassination of benazir bhutto last year
6280258 and pakistani inter services intelligence which introduced osama bin laden to the taliban in 1996 continues selectively to manipulate misdirect and frustrate western intelligence efforts in the region
6280259 conditions have changed dramatically so im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything but at the same time theres already been discussion among the western states
6280260 on a year in year out basis theres probably no issue more important to the west than water
6280261 youve got to be very careful with it its terribly sensitive for obvious reasons
6280262 itll spark problems in colorado when someone in arizona talks about revisiting things
6280263 thats generally interpreted as meaning that arizona wants more of colorados water
6280264 would never damage the state of colorados rights over the water
6280265 in a purple state like colorado republicans cant afford those
6280266 we dont vote for water rustlers thieves in this state we tar and feather them
6280267 for mccain to suggest particularly on the heels of last years renegotiation of the compact that we keep talking about it whatever he meant it struck me as more than just a small misstep
6280268 senator mccain believes as i do that a compact thats been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go
6280269 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change
6280270 we dont think we have the right kind of tools to help decision makers plan for the future
6280271 one of the challenges we face is to make the case that while we are in a period of warming we should not expect every year to be the warmest year on record
6280272 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6280273 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6280274 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6280275 in future priorities should be given to uses what we call coastal dependent uses
6280276 uses that need to be by the sea and those uses that dont need to be by the sea should seriously be thinking about having them set back
6280277 governments have initiated quite detailed mapping of our coastline identifying areas that could be subject to inundation
6280278 at this moment thaksins legal team is proceeding to ask for political asylum for thaksin and his family in britain
6280279 if thaksins request is met it will set terrible precedents for other rich powerful and non democratic figures in thailand as well as elsewhere to follow suit
6280280 every human activity now needs to be measured by its impact on water and the water commons
6280281 it is a flagrant violation of human rights when only the rich have access to clean water
6280282 its still easy for a policymaker to distance themselves from a purely environmental issue but it is much harder for them to ignore a public health issues
6280283 fifty years of development have wiped out local knowledge and skills about conserving and cooperating around water
6280284 were already part of many networks and campaigns weve come here in a state of inquiry how do we make a water commons revolution
6280285 it is a pity for a big country like the us to make such a small statement
6280286 up to this point it has been a disastrous games for the us in the 100m we only won one medal in the 100m we used to dominate
6280287 these things are cyclical from 1992 1997 the sprints were dominated by linford christie britain and donovan bailey canada these things happen and it is good for the sport
6280288 hes bad he broke the 100m record the 200m record im serious hes bad the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6280289 he has made history and added spirit to the event
6280290 jamaica has dominated sports athletics especially for the last 40 years but now you have the athletes staying home
6280291 we are very proud people we eat healthy and train very hard we have a tradition of natural talents
6280292 im never going to be famous my name will never be writ large on the roster of those who do things i dont do any thing not one single thing i used to bite my nails but i dont even do that any more
6280293 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6280294 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6280295 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6280296 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away
6280297 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6280298 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6280299 from a consumer standpoint more and more of these feed costs are going to be passed on and that means higher prices at the supermarket
6280300 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6280301 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6280302 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6280303 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6280304 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6280305 the rationale for government involvement is to maintain fannies and freddies role in the marketplace which comes through buying mortgages
6280306 i knew something was wrong because the aircraft was flying extremely low and it looked unstable
6280307 there is a big motorcade in the town square of falmouth that has been going on for more than two hours
6280308 the town square was blocked for more than an hour before it cleared a bit but the celebrations are continuing
6280309 some persons have placed desks in the road and placed a vast amount of liquor on them for everyone to drink and be merry it is just like carnival down here
6280310 there will be a massive street dance in his home community of sherwood content later tonight
6280311 we are also getting a committee together to plan a big home coming celebration for whenever usain decides to come home
6280312 i was so excited it was as if i had won the gold myself this is truly amazing
6280313 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6280314 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6280315 unless we come with a spirit of cooperation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6280316 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6280317 information on the number of people involved is not yet available but spanair is doing everything possible to help the spanish authorities at this difficult time
6280318 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6280319 hes my sugar daddy and im his candy girl and we got the sweetest love in the whole wide world
6280320 top democratic party officials are expecting sen barack obama to select indiana sen evan bayh as his running mate as early as midweek
6280321 on october 2 2002 bayh joined president george w bush and congressional leaders in a rose garden ceremony announcing their agreement on the joint resolution authorizing the iraq war and was thanked by bush and senator john mccain for co sponsoring the resolution
6280322 the committee is a neo con group that was formed to propagandize the country into war it boasted such illustrious neocon members as bill kristol former cia director james woolsey and even mccain senior foreign policy adviser and chalabi bamboozler randy scheunemann
6280323 refused as some of his fellow senators already had to renounce his support for the war

6280329 the 28 million licensed drivers in california and washington have had plenty of time to prepare for the law since the measure was adopted by the legislature back in 2006 and i think that government agencies and manufacturers of hands free products have done a really great job of creating awareness among consumers
6280330 the july 1 deadline to go hands free in california had a substantial effect on parrot branded products
6280331 we experienced over 180 percent unit sales growth in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to the first quarter having trained sales staff in place was extremely important as consumers struggled to understand bluetooth and what their options were beyond headsets
6280332 jewelry retailers told us they wanted a consumer financing program to help them run their businesses more easily and efficiently
6280333 when we created the wells fargo jewelry advantage credit card program we focused on the areas that are important to them quick application decisions and innovative technology to support their processes

6280339 i wrote the book the music and the lyrics where are they going to get the songs from whos going to do that thats a bit strange isnt it
6280340 which has given us such cultural milestones as the hills
6280341 te siento tan distante y tan cerca a la vez
6280342 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6280343 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6280344 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6280345 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6280346 lapisan anti air kami bisa dipasang pada sebuah material dengan prosedur celup dan keringkan pada suhu kamar

6280350 john and his daughter jennifer ann returned to sydney with the family silver which was johns heritage sailing on the ship
6280351 this was the same voyage as the one on which ann moran sailed as convict in 1801 trackback from your own site
6280352 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6280353 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6280354 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6280355 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6280356 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6280357 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6280358 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6280359 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6280360 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6280361 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6280362 an article on ars technica reveals mozillas intention to create and release a plugin for internet explorer that would allow the often criticized ie to utilize some of the cooler rendering code developed for firefox
6280363 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6280364 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6280365 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6280366 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6280367 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6280368 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6280369 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6280370 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6280371 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6280372 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6280373 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6280374 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6280375 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6280376 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6280377 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6280378 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6280379 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6280380 we dont think we have the right kind of tools to help decision makers plan for the future
6280381 one of the challenges we face is to make the case that while we are in a period of warming we should not expect every year to be the warmest year on record
6280382 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6280383 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6280384 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6280385 of cause like always trevor was ready to dismantle my argument with just two sentences
6280386 as much as i hated it then trevor sure did take the shackles of my brain
6280387 it is also not uncommon for afrikaner men to base this on concepts from the bible that is warped for their purposes
6280388 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6280389 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6280390 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6280391 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6280392 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6280393 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6280394 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6280395 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6280396 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6280397 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6280398 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6280399 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6280400 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6280401 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6280402 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6280403 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6280404 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6280405 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6280406 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6280407 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6280408 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6280409 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6280410 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6280411 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6280412 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6280413 the seasons are changing tremendously you can no longer say winter is in november december or march it falls in other months sometimes
6280414 producers can no longer make well laid plans calculations are not the same
6280415 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6280416 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6280417 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6280418 oh the usual people having sex with people theyre not married to instead of their spouses
6280419 conditions have changed dramatically so im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything but at the same time theres already been discussion among the western states
6280420 on a year in year out basis theres probably no issue more important to the west than water
6280421 youve got to be very careful with it its terribly sensitive for obvious reasons
6280422 itll spark problems in colorado when someone in arizona talks about revisiting things
6280423 thats generally interpreted as meaning that arizona wants more of colorados water
6280424 would never damage the state of colorados rights over the water
6280425 in a purple state like colorado republicans cant afford those
6280426 we dont vote for water rustlers thieves in this state we tar and feather them
6280427 for mccain to suggest particularly on the heels of last years renegotiation of the compact that we keep talking about it whatever he meant it struck me as more than just a small misstep
6280428 senator mccain believes as i do that a compact thats been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go
6280429 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change
6280430 if you were stranded on a desert island for the rest of your life what three items would you want to have with you
6280431 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6280432 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6280433 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6280434 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6280435 every human activity now needs to be measured by its impact on water and the water commons
6280436 it is a flagrant violation of human rights when only the rich have access to clean water
6280437 its still easy for a policymaker to distance themselves from a purely environmental issue but it is much harder for them to ignore a public health issues
6280438 fifty years of development have wiped out local knowledge and skills about conserving and cooperating around water
6280439 were already part of many networks and campaigns weve come here in a state of inquiry how do we make a water commons revolution
6280440 well i was hitting pretty well but my eyesights gotten so bad i couldnt see where the ball went

6280451 si on veut entrer dans une discussion approfondie sur la r forme de letat lon sait que la probl matique des bourgmestres est l et jai toujours dit quil fallait trouver une solution je nai jamais voulu imposer une d cision mais je veux trouver une solution dont tout le monde puisse se satisfaire
6280452 tell me all the things you would change i dont pretend to know what you want
6280453 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6280454 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6280455 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6280456 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6280457 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6280458 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6280459 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6280460 who are open to doing something on the production side
6280461 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6280462 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6280463 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6280464 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6280465 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6280466 unless we come with a spirit of cooperation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6280467 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6280468 in future priorities should be given to uses what we call coastal dependent uses
6280469 uses that need to be by the sea and those uses that dont need to be by the sea should seriously be thinking about having them set back
6280470 governments have initiated quite detailed mapping of our coastline identifying areas that could be subject to inundation
6280471 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6280472 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6280473 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6280474 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6280475 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6280476 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6280477 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6280478 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6280479 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6280480 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6280481 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6280491 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking

6280496 the conservatives think they deserve the keys to no 10 without having the decency to tell the voters what they would do if they got there
6280497 they have started to talk down to britain telling voters the votes in the bag

6280535 symptoms may seem like the flu but within a day a child could die it can be spread through a shared glass of water or a kiss
6280536 the cdc recommends that if your child is between the ages of 11 and 18 that he or she be vaccinated
6280537 not everyone will be protected from the disease that receive the vaccination
6280538 people with guillain barre syndrome should not take the vaccine and there is an increased chance of developing guillain barre syndrome by taking the vaccine
6280539 people who are allergic to any of the ingredients of the vaccine also should not receive the vaccine
6280540 meningitis is mostly bacterial or viral but some rare cases are caused by fungus bacterial meningitis is usually more serious than other forms
6280541 the risk of getting the disease is very low although meningococcal disease is infectious and can cause outbreaks 97 out of every 100 cases are isolated with no link to any other cases the bacteria that cause the disease are very common at any time about one in ten of us has them in our noses and throats without ever knowing they are there and for most of us this is harmless we pass the bacteria between each other by close contact e g kissing usually we have to be in very close or regular contact with someone for the bacteria to pass between us even when this happens most of us will not become ill because we have natural immunity the bacteria cannot live longer than a few moments outside the human body so they are not carried on things like clothes and bedding toys or dishes

6280579 everyone knows where mr oei is hes not hiding out if he were indicted and told about it he would have gone in
6280580 the timing raises questions why the public spectacle mr oei is a responsible person and he intends to fight these charges because theyre wrong
6280581 well go straight to court and were going to pound this charge into the ground
6280582 we just feel very strongly that this is not someone who should be in the loudoun county school system

6280587 for their leadership role on their campuses it just seems like they didnt do enough homework to look at the science on this
6280588 im an alumnus of dickinson college and cant believe they signed on to this initiative
6280589 they are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it very disappointing
6280590 we want to encourage an honest and constructive dialogue among educators lawmakers parents and students
6280591 if what we are doing now doesnt work then we have an obligation to ourselves and to society to explore what might
6280592 its a very serious problem on college campuses and it just seems to get worse and worse
6280593 if theyre over there in iraq and have been shot at they may as well be able to have a beer when they get back home
6280594 the political popularity of federal highway money far outweighs the popularity of letting 18 year olds drink
6280595 in college youre free for the first time ever there are no rules
6280596 in high school there are rules and maybe its better to start drinking when there are rules

6280651 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
6280652 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
6280653 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
6280654 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
6280655 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
6280656 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
6280657 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
6280658 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
6280659 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
6280660 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
6280661 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
6280662 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
6280663 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
6280664 british troops who lost 13 soldiers in june alone killed a woman and two children last weekend which the high command naturally blamed on the taliban
6280665 its not the good war certain people say it is
6280666 and as mission creep has detached the afghan war from its original declared target of al qaida
6280667 its own iraq style surge of us and other nato forces
6280668 the only way to end the war is the withdrawal of foreign troops as part of a political settlement negotiated with all the significant players in the country including the taliban and guaranteed by the regional powers and neighbouring states
6280669 well i dont see why youd come back if thats where you want to be
6280670 when i count whats wrong with my life i get totally depressed
6280671 i often feel like crying when im reading some childrens books aloud to our two floss and the secret garden can raise a few
6280672 my friend cried at a movie starring the former wrestler the rock he claimed it was too hot we no longer speak
6280673 the strangest thing that has ever set me off was listening to the radio and hearing concorde land for the very last time i dont even like planes but it made me blub
6280674 flying the thin air and free g amp ts make people more emotional i blubbed like a baby in business class watching gloria and mumbo shake it out in happy feet
6280675 the paralympics every time that and watching muhammad ali lighting the flame in atlanta it must be genetic as my dad turns into a sodden mess at the trunk holding through bars scene in dumbo

6280777 reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesnt go away
6280778 the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell
6280779 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
6280780 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
6280781 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
6280782 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
6280783 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
6280784 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
6280785 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
6280786 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
6280787 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
6280788 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
6280789 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
6280790 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
6280791 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
6280792 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
6280793 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
6280794 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
6280795 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
6280796 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
6280797 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
6280798 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
6280799 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels
6280800 consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
6280801 the national bn is already sending thousands of campaigners to permatang pauh knowing the extent and extravagance of bn campaigning the costs will likely be in tens of millions of ringgit
6280802 for many umno divisional delegates a trip to permatang pauh is also a joy trip for the on going party divisional election campaign
6280803 it remains to be seen how the bn will settle the election debts of the march 2008 general elections and now the bn has to face their most feared opponent in a by election
6280804 we all know that the worst is yet to come by year end families will face the prospects of higher school bus fares and various expenses related to schooling
6280805 low income parents will have to make a heart breaking choice of either to send their children back to school or to let them work in a tough job market due to economic stagnation with more jobless people
6280806 inflation will rise beyond 8 per cent and ordinary people will have to forego some basic necessities of life
6280807 our two mps might spend the weekend parliament break to visit the constituency of permatang pauh with other mps
6280808 what i am proposing is that the psychology of the mature human being is an unfolding emergent oscillating spiraling process marked by progressive subordination of old lower order behavior systems to new higher order systems as mans existential problems change
6280809 he makes the world go round when proper ritual is performed he answers the prayers of those who are obedient
6280810 followers of the red christ go with him into battle on behalf of their tribe nation or belief system the red christ led the christian armies in the crusades he also led the u s army into iraq
6280811 as part of the divine plan god sends his only son to suffer and die on behalf of humanity modelling sacrifice of self for a future reward he is the only truth the only way and the only life and if you dont believe it youre going to hell
6280812 christ is seen as the human one a teacher of spiritual wisdom
6280813 the yellow integral christ encompasses the universe and all cultures as an integrated ecology of systems followers of this christ become fascinated by the world that the new sciences are discovering and by how this world connects to the core metaphors and narratives of the judeo christian tradition
6280814 at this level the world is experienced not merely conceptualized as one a follower of this christ does not merely perceive the universe as an integrated whole she knows herself to be a form of the integrated whole the part in whom the whole is manifest the great diversity of life is also an expression of the holy one all of life is sacred revelation for those with eyes to see

6280819 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed
6280820 israel exported failed generals in order to train the georgian armed forces including general gal hirsch and we all know that the georgian army was defeated by the russian forces
6280821 defense minister ehud barak who accuses the political and security echelon of lacking experience during the period of the second lebanon war what can he say to his failures during his term as prime minister particularly the hasty departure from lebanon
6280822 i also remind idf chief of staff gabi ashkenazi of his failures during the period when he served as goc northern command they both failed then and therefore they dont scare us today
6280823 georgia relied on israeli generals as well as israeli weapons and faced failure
6280824 what happened in georgia is a message to all those governments who rely on americas support and encouragement to go on adventures and wars which has not been studied
6280825 confrontations which see no end and at the end abandon
6280826 perhaps it is a strange coincidence that this time around our strategic interests coincide with those of israel the regime of the mullahs in iran is our enemy and at the same time it is an enemy not just of israel but of world peace and security
6280827 confrontation is the solution there is no solution but confrontation
6280828 imagine what irans influence hegemony and fifth column would be like if iran had a nuclear bomb
6280829 i know that the arab demagogues stand together indiscriminately with anyone who is against israel and america but we need to not be swept away by these demagogues as we were in the past this time the absolute priority must be our strategic security in the gulf which is threatened by iran even if this comes at the expense of the palestinian cause
6280830 thus we need to push the world powers and especially the u s and the eu towards military confrontation to neutralize the iranian enemy whatever the cost before the nuclear bomb makes it too late even if it is against the will of the arabs of the north
6280831 what the iranians are doing not only in iran but in yemen bahrain and lebanon is unacceptable to saudi arabia and we will oppose them as we have in yemen

6280867 i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely and one of the things that i strongly believe is that you know we are not going to as individuals erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront it when we see it

6280873 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
6280874 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
6280875 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
6280876 the war which was triggered in georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia
6280877 georgia started this crisis but the west is blaming russia
6280878 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6280879 our ongoing efforts to help put back on track the settlement in the middle east
6280880 it is very important for russia to gain a military foothold in the mediterranean
6280881 syria is part of what moscow considers the near abroad so if you ask me whether this is part of renewed alliances along cold war lines the answer is yes and for israel this is a very dangerous game
6280882 whether its the right thing to do or not we shouldnt end our support for georgia just because the russians dont like it because i simply dont believe their promises
6280883 will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
6280884 very rare case reports of pancreatitis with complications or with a fatal outcome
6280885 we are trying to bring the agreement to a close it is not done yet

6280892 yes the first danzig lp was released in fall of 1988 on def american
6280893 yeah rick produced and for that record was very hands on
6280894 well he was at every recording session and insisted on doing each track until he had what he felt was the best take danzig 1 was recorded at 3 different studios in nyc and there are multiple reels of tape for each song from each studio
6280895 i think the only insane part was not recording over the takes he felt were totally unusable each time we changed studios a truck would have to come and pick up all the 2
6280896 youd have to ask him but i think so at the time he expressed his happiness at how the record turned out and how it was received in the press
6280897 it will be my first full us tour in three years there are even two canadian shows and possibly some dates in mexico and south america
6280898 for this 20th anniversary tour the set will start off with skin carver and then go in sequence from danzig 1 to 2 to 3 and on and on up to the present

6280908 we would of course welcome that the areas are genuinely used
6280909 the idea of demonstrations is hoping to resolve issues its not demonstration for the sake of demonstration so were actually quite pleased that many of the 77 cases were resolved
6280910 the ioc took the decision to come to beijing because opening the door engaging is the way forward
6280911 demmel was severely dehydrated and had mentioned several times to his tech that he felt lightheaded during the show
6280912 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
6280913 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
6280914 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
6280915 i know that none of us are immune from anything
6280916 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
6280917 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
6280918 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
6280919 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
6280920 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
6280921 you might have a family thats having a hard time and it might take another day and thats ok
6280922 if you are an extraordinary person you will have no trouble recognizing dr
6280923 urinary arsenic reflects exposures from all routes air water and food which makes it difficult to track the actual source of arsenic exposure let alone use the results from this study to establish drinking water standards
6280924 out of the clear blue sky i was telling them my social security number
6280925 she has probably 20 aliases and 20 social security numbers
6280926 to me i was wondering if im a criminal and wanted on a fugitive warrant why are they letting me take my personal vehicle
6280927 that they were doing everything in their power they could do
6280928 if the person in california would have looked at the photograph that we e mailed them they could have very clearly seen that this was not that individual
6280929 the officers on our end did everything they possibly could to try to get information from california to confirm or deny that this was the person they had stopped
6280930 our main objective at this point is to try to get it fixed in our system that it does not happen to her again
6280931 i lost my appetite and i tried to build myself back up to it
6280932 a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6280933 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6280934 a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6280935 aaron didnt do anything wrong he did what i did he used the guard to go to ou
6280936 christian strong duty values heart country proud blah blah blah
6280937 and there are too many air national guardsmen that have served for him to do that he is not one of them
6280938 right after sept 11 things settled down and deployments were starting to come down
6280939 we had received a requirement to send a team to kuwait and all of a sudden aaron submits a conscientious objector packet i believe it was a subterfuge to keep from going to the desert cause he was on the list
6280940 i also did everything i was asked to do and went everywhere i was asked to go i sought the co status mainly because of my christian principles
6280941 and i had serious questions about whether or not i could take someones life
6280942 youre not deployed while the request is being acted on
6280943 so until its either approved or disapproved the co application he was saying he cant pick up a weapon to defend this country he sat in an administrative role at will rogers while other people filled in for him and went to the desert
6280944 honestly it never really entered my mind when i signed up for the service that i might have to take another persons life thats why it was such a tough decision i did it to protect the guys i was with
6280945 i did a brief investigation found out what he was doing and submitted the information to the judge advocate general jag
6280946 when youre in a certain status you have to pay for your meals
6280947 but he was going over and eating and not paying for his meals which constitutes fraud
6280948 it was over one meal and he placed me in cuffs and said he was charging me with fraud people were shocked they were completely surprised
6280949 he was involuntarily mobilized and deployed stateside under operation noble eagle which was only stateside i was deployed with him at this time while deployed he did everything he could think of to get home after he found that there was a chance we could be forward deployed overseas
6280950 he was required to pay for meals he ate at the base dining facility
6280951 he was investigated and it was found that even after being told this he still ate there without paying for those meals
6280952 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6280953 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
6280954 well you guys did it so we get to do it
6280955 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6280956 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
6280957 well you guys did it so we get to do it
6280958 a search committee was formed to search the country and they hire someone from here
6280959 then they give him a bunch more money we were told wasnt available
6280960 i dont recall any clear cut endorsement from the search committee
6280961 i have mixed emotions some of the things they said in the press release are accurate
6280962 he knows the clock is ticking and every day we delay we are digging a deeper financial hole
6280963 because their future is uncertain trained experienced investigators are going to other communities to help them
6280964 any mention that it was a fix id like to see evidence
6280965 eu perdia tr s horas por dia nesse trajeto pensei deve haver um jeito melhor de aproveitar esse tempo
6280966 convidei v rios autores para gravarem suas obras mas ningu m queria ningu m acreditava naquilo

6280969 the procedure is not one that would be recommended for everybody
6280970 there are definitely groups of patients where this can be done with the same results and fewer complications
6280971 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6280972 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6280973 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6280974 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6280975 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6280976 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6280977 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6280978 letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6280979 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6280980 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6280981 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6280982 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6280983 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6280984 for a human to catch it there must be an extreme set of circumstances involving a sick horse
6280985 infected horses typically develop a respiratory illness and all three humans who have died have had intense extremely close contact with these horses and are exposed to the mucous in the same way a parent catches a bug off a sick child theyre caring for
6280986 were not talking just walking past a stable with an infected horse these are vets and farmers people who have stayed with the horse often through the night and caught the virus by breathing it in
6280987 delayed acquisition of language skills occurring in conjunction with normal functioning in intellectual social emotional and auditory domains
6280988 a state funded child development program aimed at alleviating the difficulties posed by poverty by engaging children of low income families in a comprehensive program that addresses their emotional social health nutritional and psychological needs the program utilizes the parents as the primary educator and the family and community as support networks

6280990 they are afraid to go out and have a look
6280991 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6280992 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6280993 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6280994 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6280995 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6280996 i wanted somebody whom i felt could carry on what i tried to do for 30 years in that congressional district
6280997 she took it to a higher level a new level she made me so proud
6280998 there is only one stephanie tubbs jones she was so talented gifted and charismatic she had so much more to be able to give
6280999 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6281000 she has a lot of energy shes very bright and shes very effective she also has a big heart and has never forgotten her roots
6281001 it was the closest thing to hell that i have seen
6281002 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6281003 as opposed to what chugging it out of the press pot
6281004 honey what do you think you think we should get some peets
6281005 we want to save a species at risk without putting humanity at risk
6281006 its a critical time for the vaquita and the mexican government has stepped up to the plate

6281012 it said three diseases human papillomavirus or genital wart virus a parasitic infection called trichomoniasis and chlamydia accounted for 88 percent of all new cases of stds in 15 to 24 year olds wart virus is the major cause of cervical cancer while chlamydia can cause infertility
6281013 our message will not be silenced nor will our first amendment rights be abridged
6281014 we are excited to learn that the free speech rights of pro life students on campus have been restored
6281015 all the group wanted to do was educate fellow students about the horrors of abortion how can they do that when their speech gets restricted to low visibility areas of campus we are thankful to the alliance defense fund for coming to their aid
6281016 federal correctional officers like jose rivera courageously put themselves in harms way every day officer riveras death will not be in vain these two murderers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent under federal law
6281017 the bureau of prisons would like to thank and commend the united states attorneys office for their diligence in bringing this case forward this is an important first step in what we hope will be a relatively short process of bringing some closure to this tragic event we would also like to thank the fbi and our own bureau of prisons staff who were instrumental in the investigation of this murder
6281018 at the purpose driven forum saturday night barack obama took off on justice clarence thomas for lacking the experience necessary to sit on the supreme court thats a riot coming from a man who decided he was qualified to be the leader of the free world after one whopping year in the u s senate
6281019 obamas statements regarding the supreme court were ludicrous they reveal that obama is ignorant of facts and history misunderstands the constitution and contradicts himself in his own alleged criteria for supreme court nominees
6281020 americans who care about the future of the supreme court need to look very carefully at obamas comments because they show what poor judgment and criteria he would use in selecting supreme court justices if he were elected president
6281021 it was clear last night that obamas criteria for selecting supreme court justices are fuzzy lack intellectual coherence and are subject to his own whims
6281022 all this speaks volumes about the kind of judges obama would appoint and the way he would fill several potential vacancies at the supreme court that could arise during the next presidents term in office
6281023 obamas answer about the three wisest people in his life upon whom he would rely heavily in his administration also sheds light on the way he would choose supreme court justices obama said he would consult his grandmother his wife and ted kennedy this is unlikely to yield the highest quality judicial nominees who understand the constitution and the role of judges in our constitutional democracy
6281024 obama started to say that justice thomas didnt have enough experience for the supreme court
6281025 obama is obviously ignorant of the fact established through the blackmun papers and independent journalists and scholars that justice thomas has been a leading intellect on the court from day one including an influence on justice scalia whom obama credited with intellectual brilliance
6281026 apparently obama can do no better than to recycle discredited statements of harry reid when it comes to justice thomas like other liberal elites obama cannot stand it when a black man strays from the ideological plantation and refuses to implement liberal policies through the courts but obama will never point out any intellectual deficiencies in justice thomass work because he cant justice thomass opinions consistently reveal faithfulness to the constitution judicial modesty and deference to the will of the people in our representative democracy that is opposed to everything that obama and the liberals are trying to do in grabbing power from the people and giving it to the courts

6281031 this incident dramatizes and reinforces the real benefits of security cameras within our communities
6281032 all elevator buildings with a high percentage of elderly residents need to have security cameras in place
6281033 we are pretty optimistic that when voters and citizens understand that skelos and company are stonewalling in favor of millionaires over the middle class that there will be valuable repercussions
6281034 the capacity to inject an issue into an electoral situation and make it come alive
6281035 this issue has not been resolved but the crisis has been avoided
6281036 going forward this means we have a lot of work that well be doing after this election
6281037 you cant just keep charging physicians 8 more in surcharges a year and not have an access crisis
6281038 the same forces that are here will still be there arguably theyll be even stronger
6281039 unchanged it is our view that were looking at a system that cannot stand
6281040 with the change in administration the change in governor suddenly we had a whole new set of players at the table
6281041 it might sound old fashioned but i believe that in america the right of property owners is sacred
6281042 im not against development but let the businesses here take part in it
6281043 if the city would put in infrastructure like sewers and roads the area would develop itself corporations would want to come there would be none of this perceived unsightliness and we wouldnt be displaced
6281044 the minister of holy communion must refuse to distribute it
6281045 the discipline regarding the denial of holy communion to those obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin
6281046 yes this excommunication was not an arbitrary one but is allowed by canon law which says that the killing of an innocent child is incompatible with receiving communion which is receiving the body of christ the mexican bishops did nothing new surprising or arbitrary they simply announced publicly what is contained in the law of the church which expresses our appreciation for life and that human individuality human personality is present from the first moment politicians who support abortion will get the penalty of excommunication this is not revenge it is just what happens in the case of serious sins
6281047 john paul ii continuing the constant teaching of the church has reiterated many times that those who are directly involved in lawmaking bodies have a grave and clear obligation to oppose any law that attacks human life
6281048 another fundamental right of the faithful as noted in canon 213 is the right to receive assistance by the sacred pastors from the spiritual goods of the church especially the word of god and the sacraments in view of the law that sacred ministers may not deny the sacraments to those who opportunely ask for them are properly disposed and are not prohibited by law from receiving them canon 843 1 there should be no such refusal to any catholic who presents himself for holy communion at mass except in cases presenting a danger of grave scandal to other believers arising out of the persons unrepented public sin or obstinate heresy or schism publicly professed or declared
6281049 pontifical council for legislative texts declaration holy communion and divorced civilly remarried catholics
6281050 it was your own people and the chief priests who have handed you over to me
6281051 he who handed me over to you is guilty of the greater sin
6281052 those upon whom the penalty of excommunication or interdict has been imposed or declared and others who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion
6281053 a person is to be punished with a just penalty who gravely harms public morals

6281057 europeans are going to start pulling back to change business and personal vacation planning
6281058 has been a really good buffer for us all summer but now well be much more at the mercy of whatever the local downturn may be
6281059 all factors are pointing in the wrong direction right now for hotels
6281060 i do predict that hotel occupancies are going to drop from where they were
6281061 our export growth has been responsible for keeping the economy afloat
6281062 the best time to buy for europeans is behind us at this point
6281063 the euro just isnt going to be buying as much next year if europe is in a full blown recession i would expect to see a significant decline in buyers
6281064 the weak dollar opened up an entire market for investment
6281065 suddenly mom and pop whod saved some cash were able to get in
6281066 if its slowing at home theyre less inclined to throw money overseas
6281067 hes been asking if he should sell he overextended himself in europe
6281068 you may see a group of buyers rush to buy now because they feel their euros are going to devalue more and more and theyll get it cheaper now
6281069 i am totally focused on being the majority in the new york state senate
6281070 future campaigns i am not thinking about that said andrew cuomo is terrific
6281071 im happy doing what im doing and thats what were focused on
6281072 new yorkers should not have to beg for basic assurances that the air they breathe is not toxic
6281073 the site may be safe but these residents just dont know and with con eds track record its no wonder theyre worried
6281074 she looks like a pterodactyl in a gay jurassic park
6281075 if obama is trying to court women particularly women from hillarys camp he should be wary of using larry summers as a surrogate it would potentially cause concerns and hesitation
6281076 certainly there are better people in the party and for him to surround himself with who dont have a negative attitude toward women and their abilities
6281077 are the same antiquated views that people had about african americans
6281078 i am confident that if senator obama chooses to include mr summers in his administration he will work tirelessly to reverse the failed economic policies of the past eight years and we will all benefit from his service to our country
6281079 the large majority of progressives myself included think his comment was a real mistake that he apologized and recognize that he has been and remains as an important champion for many progressive issues
6281080 the highest elected woman in the history of our country regularly relies on him thats got to count for something
6281081 if nancy pelosi supports an individual who touts the antiquated idea that women are second class citizens because of their gender all i can say is shame on you nancy pelosi
6281082 he is a big believer and proponent of women and i think that is why he was talking about the subject in the first place
6281083 ive just been happy to help the campaign when my advice has been sought
6281084 dr summers has repeatedly said that his comment on women in science was a mistake and we take him at his word
6281085 but women are more interested in the fact that barack obama has a comprehensive economic agenda for working women while john mccain has opposed legislation to guarantee equal pay and provides little tax relief for americas working women and their families
6281086 raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6281087 they would be the ones morally responsible for electing a pro choice president
6281088 i understand the sincerity but i really believe its misguided and im saying that as a person who has a 100 pro life voting record

6281090 why would we want to make america more like europe when so many of our ancestors tried so hard to get out of europe and come to america
6281091 it kills more than ten times the annual road toll
6281092 thats less than 0 5 per cent on the single biggest killer of new zealanders
6281093 hes got a bit of a strain in his thigh
6281094 its a soft tissue one so if you do try and play and mask it with a jab or anti inflammatory injections you can do more damage so certainly weve got to look after david
6281095 its just a precaution and we want to make sure hes going to be fit for next week and by playing he might do more damage to the thigh so its important we look after him
6281096 critics fixate on what water queensland takes from the murray darling basin but rarely highlight how this compares to water extracted by other basin states
6281097 the fact is the lions share of water taken from the murray darling basin every year is taken by nsw victoria and south australia
6281098 in 2006 07 total extractions across the queensland leg of the basin was just 150 gigalitres
6281099 summer rains of 2007 08 produced the first decent flows in years and allowed landholders to take some of the water they are legally entitled to take
6281100 i look forward to seeing how much water was extracted by the other basin states

6281106 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6281107 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and a pod that will care for him
6281108 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6281109 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6281110 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6281111 a lot of people said mark and i wouldnt work out then but we proved them wrong and im looking forward to working side by side with him in the enduros again
6281112 we were on pole in both races and while the results may have gone pear shaped for other reasons everything else went smoothly we had no issues and the working relationship was fine
6281113 garth and mark present one of the strongest driver combinations in the field and allow us to put our best foot forward
6281114 this is the best possible strategy for us to look after garths championship while still chasing race wins
6281115 both guys know what it takes to win enduro races and look after the car so im confident that if we get a straight run at it we can look after both of those objectives

6281117 they will also have to spend extra money for the trip
6281118 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6281119 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6281120 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6281121 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect
6281122 theres an important message here and we need to ensure it is translated into preventative work in pregnant women to reduce the risk

6281131 hes got a bit of a strain in his thigh
6281132 its a soft tissue one so if you do try and play and mask it with a jab or anti inflammatory injections you can do more damage so certainly weve got to look after david
6281133 its just a precaution and we want to make sure hes going to be fit for next week and by playing he might do more damage to the thigh so its important we look after him
6281134 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans the bank said
6281135 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do cba said today
6281136 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6281137 we currently have the lowest standard variable rate of all the major banks and st george behind the zimmerman tag
6281138 a lot of people said mark and i wouldnt work out then but we proved them wrong and im looking forward to working side by side with him in the enduros again
6281139 we were on pole in both races and while the results may have gone pear shaped for other reasons everything else went smoothly we had no issues and the working relationship was fine
6281140 garth and mark present one of the strongest driver combinations in the field and allow us to put our best foot forward
6281141 this is the best possible strategy for us to look after garths championship while still chasing race wins
6281142 both guys know what it takes to win enduro races and look after the car so im confident that if we get a straight run at it we can look after both of those objectives
6281143 there is a big motorcade in the town square of falmouth that has been going on for more than two hours
6281144 the town square was blocked for more than an hour before it cleared a bit but the celebrations are continuing
6281145 some persons have placed desks in the road and placed a vast amount of liquor on them for everyone to drink and be merry it is just like carnival down here
6281146 there will be a massive street dance in his home community of sherwood content later tonight

6281154 critics fixate on what water queensland takes from the murray darling basin but rarely highlight how this compares to water extracted by other basin states
6281155 the fact is the lions share of water taken from the murray darling basin every year is taken by nsw victoria and south australia
6281156 in 2006 07 total extractions across the queensland leg of the basin was just 150 gigalitres
6281157 summer rains of 2007 08 produced the first decent flows in years and allowed landholders to take some of the water they are legally entitled to take

6281168 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6281169 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6281170 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6281171 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect
6281172 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6281173 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6281174 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6281175 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6281176 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6281177 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6281178 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6281179 some players would do anything to not play for columbus lol jk
6281180 the last time i played the us open normal was back in 2001 when i got to the semi finals probably it was so long ago
6281181 every time i started to play well i was getting injured even when i was number one i got injured with the rib i couldnt play for two months and my ranking dropped and i lost confidence but i am getting back again the results will come eventually the ranking doesnt really matter if you get the results it will come back
6281182 its been just over one year for us now and i am pretty satisfied
6281183 he understands he has a lot of patience and is the ideal person to travel with which is very important i am not under any pressure
6281184 the knee was difficult and i was risking a little too much
6281185 thats why my ranking dropped because without confidence you cannot make any more winners from the back of the court all of a sudden the pain was gone and i could start at least to work on the movement i started to cover the court better doing more work in the gym
6281186 even if i had lost today i think i would have been pretty satisfied with my performance if a bit disappointed
6281187 these are the kind of matches i have been losing in the last year at some point it affects your confidence so to win one like this is good and hopefully i can build from here
6281188 i didnt play any matches for two weeks and i had never played her before so didnt know what to expect
6281189 but it was ok i lost my rhythm a bit on my serve but i fought to the end and i am very pleased with the win
6281190 i have been working really hard and playing well but its very satisfying to see the results coming now
6281191 my first goal is to break into the top 100 then i can set another goal hopefully i can keep going from here
6281192 but wait wouldnt you get tired of being a ninja

6281220 that working with isps to educate consumers is a more effective way of combating illegal downloading
6281221 its been exciting just everything that happened last year and coming into this year and going to a different organization and just realizing some things about where i was its been kind of crazy especially since this is my third team in a year
6281222 it was just some mistakes i made off the field that caused me to get released by them
6281223 its good its real good i like the organization its kind of the same way the yankees run things they treat their players real well its good for me theres a good bunch of guys everythings been good so far
6281224 yeah but ive still got a lot to learn all im trying to do is get better and im still learning things each and every day playing wise for me its getting an opportunity to play and showing people that i can play weve got a good team here and were trying to battle for a playoff spot and hopefully try to win a championship thats the fun part about it
6281225 it was the best ever i cant explain it it wasnt just being in the playoffs youre in the playoffs with the new york yankees it was amazing its something i can look back on and something i wish i could do again
6281226 a little bit yeah especially since ive been here for a couple years it kind of feels like my second home i know all the players and the managers and especially all the fans here but its good to be back im going to just try to have fun with it i have to go out and try to beat this team now the hard part about it is they know a lot about me theyve probably got the best scouting report on me thats the tough part about it
6281227 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
6281228 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
6281229 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
6281230 china believes all countries while adhering to their international obligations of nuclear non proliferation has the right of peaceful use of nuclear energy and to carry out international cooperation in this regard

6281234 senator obama has included a set of carefully targeted tax proposals that narrowly aim benefits to specific types of taxpayers while senator mccain provides broad tax relief with benefits that are indirect
6281235 in both cases tax relief is provided to the vast majority of the electorate
6281236 senator obama provides tax relief directly to individuals without making major changes in how the tax system interacts with or affects individual and business decision making
6281237 senator mccain provides broad tax relief and channels most of it to businesses with the notion that the best way to help workers is to encourage investment and ensure that the us remains competitive in the global marketplace
6281238 the details released by his campaign last week confirm what a president obama has in mind for our most productive citizens
6281239 the top individual income tax rate for example would be increased by 13 to 39 6 the next highest rate would be raised to 36 the top rates on capital gains and dividends would rise by a third to 20
6281240 he also contemplates several increases in the corporate income tax including a new so called windfall profits tax on oil companies
6281241 sajid had stayed in the same sarai and was there on may 13 also the sarai records also confirmed his stay here
6281242 as sajid was a known hardcore member of simi and was under scanner even earlier his identity was easily ascertained police had raided his surat home also from where his photograph was procured but the follow up by the jaipur team was certainly not up to the mark else ahmedabad blasts could have been averted
6281243 we had traced sajids movements in jaipur and kota in may and he was present in jaipur on may 13 when blasts took place
6281244 he is universally well regarded and is a wonderful wonderful man
6281245 its an unprecedented opportunity to be so close to the law that governs the united states and in many ways influences the world
6281246 it was professor david obriens constitutional law seminar that first got me interested
6281247 its hard to imagine something that holds a candle to this
6281248 while the survey demonstrates that canadas gst indirect tax system is
6281249 its interesting that one of the countries whose respondents found the canadian indirect tax system difficult to work with is china one of canadas largest trading partners
6281250 in addition some of the canadian respondents also ranked canadas system as difficult five of our provinces have both gst and a retail sales tax that businesses have to deal with based on the survey results perhaps canada could be more competitive if we didnt have both retail sales tax and gst systems in these provinces
6281251 even though the majority of canadian respondents predict that gst will increase as a source of revenue to the government and more than one third of the respondents view indirect tax as a risk for their organization its interesting that the canadian companies surveyed had one of the smallest increases in their indirect tax management resources in the last five years out of all the organizations surveyed
6281252 gst throughput can involve much more money than income tax and the cost remains significant even without profits
6281253 companies that arent paying attention to these costs may be missing opportunities to minimize them

6281266 fundamentalism and biblical critics alike fail to acknowledge the political character of their account of the bible and they fail to do so for very similar reasons they want to disguise how their interpretations underwrite the privileges of the constituency that they serve admittedly such realities may also be hidden from themselves convinced as they are of the objectivity of their method accordingly fundamentalism and biblical criticism are enlightenment ideologies in the service of the fictive agent of the enlightenment namely the rational individual who believes that truth in general and particularly the truth of the christian faith can be known without initiation into a community that requires transformation of the self in this sense fundamentalism and biblical criticism are attempts to maintain the influence of constantinian christianity now clothed in the power of the enlightenment rationality in the interest of continuing christianitys hegemony over the ethos of north american cultures fortunately or unfortunately depending on your ecclesiology america is a society that is increasingly learning that it can do well without christian presuppositions and practices the biblical critic and fundamentalist of course simply serve different constituencies within the north american polity or society the fundamentalist serves the lower and middle class the biblical critic feeds on the semiliterate class associated with the university both wish to make christianity available to the person of common sense without moral transformation all you need is to study these texts in order to discover their plain meaning both camps assume an objectivity of the text in order to make the bible available to anyone and that anyone is assumed to be the citizen of democratic polities

6281271 its more of a mental grind than it is physical
6281272 obviously your arm is going to go through some dead stages and get tired for sure
6281273 when youre out there and preparing yourself every day to compete your arm is going to get tired but its more of trying to keep yourself in it mentally more than a physical battle
6281274 its just a matter of like i said keeping yourself in it every day mentally and just trying to keep yourself prepared for those moments
6281275 its a situation where youve got one out to get
6281276 you concentrate on that hitter you know theres a lot of stuff going on behind you on the bases but right there youve just got to concentrate on getting that one guy at the plate you know if you can get him youve got a clean inning the next time so you really just focus in on that one batter at that moment
6281277 weve just got so many carries that i want to see him do during the preseason just to get his pads set and make sure his legs are ready and hes set for those full speed collisions he scrimmaged during training camp and hes been everything but tackled to the ground most of the time in training camp
6281278 we felt like we had a solid nucleus of players and what weve done is gone out and got some guys to make the group better
6281279 the thing thats really important to me is that they fit in very well weve talked a lot about being a great teammate and what exactly a great teammate is because the cohesiveness of our team is whats going to determine i think how successful we are this season
6281280 it wasnt easy for him he was grinding he wasnt as sharp as he has been his last couple starts but he made it it wasnt pretty by any means but he was effectively wild enough to keep guys off balance i was pleased more with our bullpen the way our bullpen came in and pitched
6281281 we have benefited from a strong revenue environment which was supported by major investments in customer service and product the result was further underpinned by sustained efforts to improve efficiency
6281282 caused significant disruption for our passengers and impacted qantass financial and operating performance in recent months
6281283 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present

6281317 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
6281318 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
6281319 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
6281320 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
6281321 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
6281322 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
6281323 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
6281324 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
6281325 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
6281326 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day
6281327 we hope and believe in our protocols to have a successful election
6281328 for a traditional election based on plurality you candidates dont have to have a majority to win
6281329 this really changes the dynamics of the election since its winner takes all in november with no primary
6281330 we worked a lot of hours to prepare for this and it was very challenging i am very blessed with a good staff
6281331 this was a huge undertaking that included writing new election rules and procedures
6281332 our hope is that voters wont get confused with the two ballots
6281333 most people are shocked and wonder how we ended up with a system likes this even though it was approved by the voters

6281363 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6281364 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6281365 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6281366 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6281367 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie

6281369 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
6281370 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
6281371 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
6281372 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
6281373 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years

6281451 como provincia somos muy conocidos por nuestro vino malbec se viene trabajando muy bien en esto de ganar mercados en estados unidos con nuestro vino
6281452 lo que se ha hecho es identificar la cepa del torront s riojano y explicar que es un producto muy maleable se puede hacer un jugo de uva como el vino m s caro o espumantes dulces naturales tambi n hablarles de lo que es nuestra empresa de los logros que obtuvimos y por sobre todo que se lleven un panorama de lo que estamos haciendo y que hagan un poco de efecto trasmisor en su lugar de origen
6281453 este producto tiene nombre y apellido se llama torront s riojano y este en cualquier parte del pa s no pierde su denominaci n pero es en esta zona en donde sus caracter sticas se desarrollan plenamente

6281499 theres an old saying in show business no one knows anything movie executives at least the honest ones will tell you that if theyd given green lights to half actually way less than half of the pictures they said no to and said no to all the ones they said yes to theyd probably be in exactly the same position they are if anyone tells you that they know at this point how the election will turn out then you can be sure that they really dont know anything at all
6281500 always believe your own polls especially when theyre bad my friend and pollster tubby harrison used to tell me by the summer of 1988 the country had turned from believing we were on the wrong track to thinking we were on the right track they thought my candidate governor dukakis was more conservative than he actually was thats what beating jesse jackson every tuesday will do for you by the fall it was clear right or wrong they didnt like him of course you never say that to the candidate you tell him they dont know you not that they dont like you you say its a communications problem which is why being the communications director is the hot seat in a losing campaign

6281527 i feel the reason for our success is the kids work ethic along with our coaches and mike srock
6281528 we won the state championship game on a weekend and the next monday afternoon we were in the weight room they didnt have to be there our kids are dedicated they work and schedule their vacations around days we are not doing anything which is not many
6281529 all of our program is built for speed we lay a level of strength but we do a lot of powerlifting especially the power clean working with kettles and bands theres no such thing as keeping your strength youre either gaining it or losing it we tested our guys the wednesday after the season and we were quicker and stronger a lot of teams peak in july and get weaker and slower as the season goes on
6281530 ive been wanting to play for byrnes since i was a kid
6281531 we were very lucky this guy was stopped and nobody was killed yesterday
6281532 we are lucky that the quick response from officers and help from the citizens saved us from a very serious incident
6281533 broke into the shed behind me and released about 600 to 650 mink
6281534 some of the finest minks in the world are raised right here

6281536 we have several that have been killed on the road
6281537 no were not going to stop mink farming its an honorable business its a great family business and unlike what some people think we have a great love for animals

6281545 d rives involve playful constructive behavior and awareness of psychogeographical effects and are thus quite different from the classic notions of journey or stroll in a d rive one or more persons during a certain period drop their relations their work and leisure activities and all their other usual motives for movement and action and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there chance is a less important factor in this activity than one might think from a d rive point of view cities have psychogeographical contours with constant currents fixed points and vortexes that strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones
6281546 the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment consciously organized or not on the emotions and behavior of individuals

6281552 in the past if you had linguistic intelligence if you could read and write you were smart if you had mathematical and logical intelligence you still got credit for that but what if you had musical intelligence or what if you had kinetic intelligence you see that with musicians and athletes so howard gardner says there are gifts in all of us and its up to us to teach to those
6281553 i have worked on wonderful projects on artful thinking with the metropolitan museum of art children studied paintings not just about the artist and his style but to look at the relationships between the characters in the painting and the setting its a way of developing thoughtful dispositions
6281554 in a looped classroom that gave me two years to develop my program with the same children starting in the first grade i began mixing great works of art with classical music and over time i introduced rock the blues and jazz
6281555 the children were drawn to the range of feelings in the songs as i gave them the backgrounds of the compositions
6281556 alabama for example was about martin luther king and racial discrimination and while my own true love concerned a man and a woman john coltranes love supreme expressed a love for humanity
6281557 ill never know what the listeners feel from my music and thats too bad
6281558 but the more avant garde recordings such as interstellar space
6281559 i have discovered that young children have open welcoming minds and the more pure and emotional the music the more they connect soon they were hooked on john coltranes music
6281560 during the past few months you have given your students a wealth of prior knowledge they could not have received anywhere throughout the assembly program every single one of your students smiled from ear to ear and walked with their chests pushed out and their heads held high they will never forget this day when their teacher made them feel larger than life
6281561 we will invite these students already familiar with his music and also new members
6281562 the work of other jazz musicians and other genres of music as well as connecting music to visual art
6281563 i hear in johns music a direct message to me as a teacher and that is to go on teaching children in a way that respects their individuality
6281564 when youre playing with someone who really has something to say even though they may otherwise be quite different in style theres one thing that remains constant and that is the tension of the experience that electricity that kind of feeling that is a lift kind of feeling no matter where it happens you know when that feeling comes upon you and it makes you feel happy
6281565 liberal in alberta has some baggage from the federal liberals i know a lot of people in this province who would like a centrist party im committed to recognizing that there are weaknesses within the party and addressing them
6281566 over the next few years im also on the record as saying that we may have to revisit the name of the alberta liberal party
6281567 we dont expect another appointment in the supreme court for some time to come so it was important now to set a firm base for the supreme courts future and i think chris kourakis is recognised as the most outstanding silk in south australia
6281568 you will end up at the lower end of the scale with unintended people ending up in prison in minor circumstances

6281570 you are ruining this family because you are a attention whore
6281571 if you believe the majority of media portraits youd think that same sex marriage is primarily an issue for middle to upper middle class gay white folks
6281572 the absence of diverse images and voices talking about this most fundamental right can make some people wrongly believe that the freedom to marry doesnt concern the african american community of course that couldnt be farther from the truth loving committed same sex couples from many different backgrounds are all involved in the work required to secure the benefits of civil marriage for everyone in our community

6281587 this is a message of intolerance and a perfidious scene of ethnic cleansing that was preconceived as a way to drive away people of other ethnicities and religions living in sarajevo
6281588 well dont tell gem we talked because she doesnt like the choices that you make
6281589 four years ago i thought that 2008 is not that far away then i had three major surgeries
6281590 i think through our courage we got this far but we were limited by our capabilities
6281591 i think that what you have seen is my facial expression on the court
6281592 this is my job the olympics are not only about the game they are about friendship about exchanging pins making friends at the opening ceremony

6281595 i want to do what i was doing ill be fine i just want to finish strong i think i can get five six more starts
6281596 right now were a little thin in the starting situation but if we felt we needed to go to a six man rotation we will bochy said
6281597 its not like ive pitched a lot i mean 135 innings is not a lot for a starter
6281598 i think it will be a little lower than normal
6281599 i can take a lot from this and take it back to college its great to play against the greatest point guards in the world
6281600 i read something that said that hes faster than me theyre probably right
6281601 youve just got to treat them like theyre ordinary players
6281602 i thought the one avenue we had to be successful in this game was patty mills
6281603 i thought he put on a hell of a show for a young kid playing in his first olympics
6281604 he has the potential to be a very good one and i know he wants to get to the nba
6281605 i f president bush is re elected he will have to restart the draft
6281606 the draft issue has largely come to public attention due to pair of bills introduced in congress not by legislators genuinely seeking to reinstate the draft but by democrats seeking to make an anti war statement the bills languished in committee for 21 months before republicans brought the house version to the floor and overwhelmingly defeated it in october 2004
6281607 we have signed three quality players with a wealth of experience
6281608 i am delighted to sign phillip leuluai who has been an outstanding player in the nrl over the past couple of seasons
6281609 considering the number of players we have out and the number of players who took the field injured i thought we were solid
6281610 i thought we were a bit soft around the edges in patches the kids are doing well and its hard on them especially the week in week out stuff preparing mentally and physically but they are doing a great job for us
6281611 were very much a jekyll and hyde side at the moment im still making decisions on players today i have a different opinion to what i had last week its very confusing for me and im at a loss to explain it
6281612 a couple of weeks ago we were beaten soundly by wakefield and warrington and then last week we beat bradford so i thought we could build on that
6281613 defensively we were very poor willie manu not only didnt get tackled i dont think he got touched you cant build a game plan around that after 20 minutes the game was probably over
6281614 on the back of our last two performances against wakefield and warrington the guys deserve credit
6281615 the first half was very good we didnt start the second half as well and had to do a lot of hanging on
6281616 bradford threw plenty at us and it was going to take a lot of mental strength to get back in front but we played the last 15 or 20 minutes very well
6281617 salford played very well and hardly made an error and our complete lack of discipline and non performance cost us the game
6281618 i have enough problems with my own team after this performance without worrying about the refereeing decisions
6281619 we only have ourselves to blame and i dont think next saturdays cup semi final had anything to do with it
6281620 leaving the club has been an extremely difficult decision to make but i feel that the time is right
6281621 being overlooked as head coach at salford city reds has obviously unsettled him
6281622 we wish him well and thank him for his valuable contribution at the club
6281623 kevins final try took some scoring to outpace two chasers was very special and kevin has the potential to play top level football
6281624 he has the pace for all to see and has taken his chance exceptionally well
6281625 henry faafili delivered him some great balls adrian morley was almost unstoppable and jon clarke was very smart from dummy half
6281626 i thought we would respond after last weeks defeat by wakefield but this was very similar and we were unable to cope with the conditions and the scoreline reflected the difference between the sides
6281627 the issue of relegation does not concern me at the moment because if we play well we will win games
6281628 too much is being made of it with eight games to go and i dont want to put the blokes under any more pressure but clearly we need to turn things around
6281629 with two more wins i think well be okay but it would be dicey if we only win one more
6281630 both teams played very nervously it wasnt a classic but entertaining for the fans with plenty of end to end action
6281631 it was an outstanding team performance and paul cooke and james webster were very impressive
6281632 we need to win two more games than hull kr and there are only five matches left so its become an even bigger challenge
6281633 rovers deserved to win we were very poor in the second half despite leading 12 10 at half time and not playing that well
6281634 certain people did not handle the pressure as well as i would have liked
6281635 because of this trend hotspot operators are turning to other methods to generate revenues
6281636 operators have started bundling hotspot access with other services such as fixed and mobile broadband this way consumers can access hotspots without paying a separate fee and operators can generate some access revenue by bundling the cost of the service into a bigger service package that consumers are willing to purchase
6281637 cable broadcast and telco tv are all highly competitive markets for video servers
6281638 cable and broadcast are the more traditional modes of entertainment for consumers but cable providers and telcos have been quicker to adapt to market trends and to offer innovative consumer services but to remain competitive even the broadcast segment has tried its hand at hybrid deployments and similar initiatives
6281639 callers did not think they were bound by the do not call list and now they are
6281640 why did no one run over to help him in an emergency maybe his life could have been saved
6281641 peoples lives are being lost but sometimes i wonder if anyone cares if another mexican immigrant dies
6281642 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6281643 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6281644 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6281645 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6281646 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6281647 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6281648 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6281649 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6281650 i completely understand that cal osha is overworked and understaffed but whats offensive is that the agency is reducing fines with no justification
6281651 in some cases companies are paying pennies on the dollar from the original fine imposed
6281652 our offensive line penalties have been down through two games
6281653 we praised our offensive line for how well it played all last year and how well we ran the ball but we led the league in penalties on the offensive line were not skipping over that
6281654 that means all positions from what ive seen were working toward that direction at the same time we have to concentrate on playing football we cant always be thinking about penalties we just have to be smart and not put ourselves in bad positions
6281655 ill be all right depending upon how well i can protect my hand from here on
6281656 unfortunately i havent seen it i dont how many wednesday probably seven drops and a number of them with our front line guys so well see well come out here today and the plan is for these guys to play a lot in the game and get some shots to produce
6281657 bts cash flows continue to come under pressure from lower margins and higher capex
6281658 it seems a significant leap of faith to believe that this will now come through
6281659 the investment case now hinges on the ability of the new ceo to maintain his track record of delivery

6281661 the board believes edda media is a very attractive business and should be maintained within the mecom stable

6281663 a relatively small part of our revenues but we will have got there in a short space of time we have proved to ourselves that creating new revenues streams from online is possible
6281664 the board believes edda media is a very attractive business and should be maintained within the mecom stable
6281665 top line pressure and rising inflation is eroding the benefits of mecoms significant rationalisation programme and all the evidence suggests that pressures on both costs and revenues will get worse rather than better in the next 12 months

6281669 we are slightly down even though we had a pretty good lead from the us mr heffernan said
6281670 but if you look at the commodities they were a mixed bag with only oil and copper up and the banks could be down because of the news about babock amp brown
6281671 the corvinet 5 0 release offers the most complete visibility analysis and diagnostics capability for network and application infrastructure in electronic trading environments
6281672 the product has been in field trials with existing customers and new prospects for three months now and has been very well received as evidenced by several pre release orders for the product
6281673 seems like a pretty major omission for a service thats specifically aimed at roaming users
6281674 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6281675 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely
6281676 i wouldnt say that its a critical issue or something thats a reason not to use the service but its definitely something that should be addressed
6281677 here things like virtualization and web services and cloud computing come into play and all of these uses have no problem keeping two four six or more cores busy
6281678 this is the area well likely see dunnington make the most impact
6281679 a better process enables higher transistor counts larger caches and more cores ultimately the cores will impact performance more but the larger caches will help as well
6281680 going from four to six cores will see close to the 50 percent improvement linear scaling with a little slowdown due to i o contention
6281681 you will find them move from via to atom over the foreseeable future
6281682 the scriptures reveal to us that god did indeed create angels
6281683 i know because i have felt their presence especially when something horrible happens around me for some reason i seem to escape unscathed
6281684 the bible tells us we have guardian angels that watch over us
6281685 take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven
6281686 the holy spirit and god are who protect us not angelic beings god gave them a different purpose
6281687 sure there are angels the bible speaks of them but they are not assigned to protect individual people
6281688 i have never felt a guardian angels protection bad things happen to me just like everyone else
6281689 i feel them around but i cant say i have ever seen one or have any proof
6281690 i hope so it sure would be nice and i could sure use the protection that people claim they give
6281691 i dont know the exact passages so i cant give an opinion but i hope so
6281692 i cant believe it shes all over me something something
6281693 it will be a reminder of what has happened over the last half century
6281694 its part of our heritage even though were a borough we cant forget how pierrefonds has made its mark
6281695 why shouldnt chinese pride in hosting the olympics involve chinese pride in the great achievements of their past
6281696 these edifices mark the space of the new china the china of grand aspirations and an urge for greatness that is assuming a distinct and quite compelling 21st century form
6281697 the fact that this postmodern architecture can rise out of the foundations of the old china is a message that is also conveyed by the iconography of these games
6281698 god with all respect and humility i need reasons give me reasons faith doesnt work for me in this case i am sorry to say i would not have taken my son to be slaughtered like abraham i thank you for not asking me to do any such thing
6281699 so far their action remains peaceful although their protests have disrupted activities at the regents office

6281711 sebelum kehadiran anak anak kami kami berdua telah membaca tentang manfaat manfaat yang dibawa oleh penyusuan susu ibu kami tahu yang ianya merupakan yang terbaik untuk anak anak kami dan kami bertekad untuk melakukannya motivasi utama kami adalah kesihatan dan kesejahteraan anak anak kami dan tiada yang lebih baik daripada susu ibu
6281712 ia juga mempunyai kelebihan sebagai contoh mempunyai bekalan nutrisi yang sudah sedia untuk bayi ketika kami berjalan jauh
6281713 selalunya diberikan oleh ahli keluarga dan rakan rakan yang mempunyai niat yang baik tetapi tidak tahu lebih baik mereka takut bayi kami tidak akan mendapat nutrisi yang secukupnya ibu akan menjadi letih penyusuan susu ibu akan melemahkan badan anda dan lain lain
6281714 bayi yang baru dilahirkan mendapat yang terbaik sebagai permulaan hidup mereka di dalam segala bentuk perkembangan apabila mereka diberikan susu ibu susu ibu adalah penting sebagai imunisasi pertama bayi ia melindungi bayi bayi daripada cirit birit dan jangkitan jangkitan akut respiratori dan juga memberi stimulasi kepada sistem imunisasi mereka dan memperbaiki maklumbalas mereka terhadap vaksinasi
6281715 di dalam keadaan ekonomi dan kenaikan harga makanan penyusuan susu badan juga membantu keluarga berjimat di antara rm 85 dan rm 275 sebulan untuk membeli makanan bayi
6281716 wanita perlu disokong oleh suami mereka masyarakat sistem kesihatan dan datuk dan nenek apabila memikirkan apa yang terbaik dan mereka mestilah disokong untuk memastikan kejayaan setelah keputusan diambil
6281717 anda perlu melengkapkan diri anda dengan maklumat dan pengetahuan yang mencukupi untuk menangani segala bentuk penasihat bayi anda akan lebih sihat kerananya dan anda juga akan menjalinkan hubungan yang kuat sebagai sebuah keluarga lebih daripada formula bayi yang dijanjikan oleh syarikat syarikat yang mengeluarkannya
6281718 secara peribadi saya memang sentiasa berada di sisi isteri saya mengenepikan segala bentuk kenyataan yang negatif tentang penyusuan susu ibu daripada rakan rakan dan ahli keluarga yang kurang berpengetahuan tentang penyusuan susu ibu dan bekalan susu
6281719 kelebihannya ia adalah pilihan yang membawa kelebihan dan faedah untuk ibu anak anak dan juga suami
6281720 dan juga penyusuan susu ibu membantu untuk mengelak kami bangun dari tidur pada waktu malam untuk memberi susu kepada bayi kerana terdapat bekalan yang sedia ada pada setiap masa
6281721 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
6281722 this illegal activity enables unauthorized individuals anywhere in the world to communicate via compromised u s phone systems in a way that is difficult to trace
6281723 i think given the spirit of the mou memorandum of understanding which up front stated that within the spirit of the agreement no party was going to convene parliament or formulate a cabinet before an agreement is signed moving to swear in parliament is in part a breach of the memorandum of understanding however we need to make a qualification there that the contestation in the talks right now is not about the swearing in of parliament is in dispute but i think the most critical point which zanu pf and president robert mugabe moves beyond that he would be crossing the rules is assembling the cabinet
6281724 assembling cabinet will actually be vesting authority in institutions and i think that will amount to be in total breach of the negotiating process and by extension it will undermine the talks
6281725 the opposition has no problem in the opening of parliament insofar as the swearing in of parliament comes in from the results of the march 29 elections which by and large the mdc has actually stated that it reflects the will of the people what the bone of contention is based on the march 29 elections which leads to the swearing in of parliament the assembly of cabinet put mugabe in a position where he uses the june 27 results that he would use for vesting himself as the president to assemble a cabinet and that is where the dispute is and that is where it will undermine the talks and the spirit of the mou
6281726 when you read the mou it states that before the agreement is signed parliament and cabinet should not be sworn in and the cabinet should not be assembled but i think the mou was based not only on an understanding but also on an assumption by the facilitator that by then they would have rapped up the deal and there would have been a concrete deal on the table and all the parties would have signed up to it so i think this issues have been long drawn and it is a long haul and there is no signature appended to this process by all the parties it actually brings into question the issue of a breach of the memorandum of understanding which says parliament and cabinet shouldnt have been assembled
6281727 i think the move is meaningless for the simple reason that what he can only get from there is that is how the issues of the speaker of our parliament is going to be nominated i think that is where the only leverage is but the battleground is the cabinet

6281734 its been a couple of years since weve had gummy sharks in the aquarium
6281735 kids come to the aquarium and ask where are the sharks
6281736 underlying publishing costs were well contained despite strong inflationary pressures on labour costs the new zealand mastheads had solid circulation and readership performance
6281737 that statement is actually not news several government officials have been claiming it ever since the icc first started looking into the situation in darfur but the thing about the claim is that it is not totally inaccurate in one sense and that is if the sudanese government decides to try the people who have been charged by the icc for the same crimes in national courts in proceedings then they can bring an admissibility challenge before the icc which is to say the way the international criminal court was established was so that national courts would have primary jurisdiction over cases but that means the government would have to be willing and able to try the case themselves
6281738 in this case sudan has not shown itself so far to be willing to try any of the people involved in the crime in darfur so it is unlikely that an admissibility challenge will succeed so the real challenge will be securing arrest without cooperation of the sudanese government
6281739 what i have heard is that there is a fear of retaliation by government forces or government sympathizers allied militia against peacekeepers and humanitarian workers if an arrest warrant is issued but with all parties be it rebels or government forces international humanitarian law requires that they not attack peacekeepers or humanitarian workers the security council and others need to make it clear that if additional crimes are committed there would be consequences for those acts
6281740 i think that threats of retaliation and i think attacks on peacekeepers should make it basically embarrassing for people who are supporters of the sudanese government in this context to continue to support them this type of regime is not something that other governments should be willing to stand behind even if in principle they think that issuing an arrest warrants against the head of a government while it is still in conflict is problematic
6281741 history is one of our schools greatest strengths however the downside was the age of our buildings
6281742 we now have these excellent facilities with disabled access to most buildings something we didnt have before
6281743 i hadnt noticed any lump the cancer just presented as a sort of different texture in the breast
6281744 so you basically have to live away from home to be able to access treatment
6281745 i stayed at the jean colvin hostel in rushcutters bay rural cancer patients can stay there when theyre having treatments at hospitals in sydney
6281746 i also took up paddling with dragons abreast for cancer survivors which is a team of the sapphire water dragons
6281747 its fantastic just like a support group and they raise funds for local needs like the bega hospital oncology department as well as things like the cancer council
6281748 the fundraising is looking for the cure particularly for young people facilities for country areas and better ways to treat cancer
6281749 being diagnosed is a real shock something you think will never happen to you only to other people
6281750 it certainly changes the way you think about things ive learned to prioritise things in my life
6281751 were looking into some kind of fencing to cut down on this kind of vandalism
6281752 when this happens our time and money is used on fixing windows instead of much needed resources for the school
6281753 the glass fitters have had to come down here twice
6281754 once to clear the broken glass and again to repair the windows
6281755 our cleaners have had to do extra work too cleaning up after the damage inside classrooms and on the grounds
6281756 regarding tension between the ukrainian authorities and the black sea fleet im strongly against that i believe representatives for the ukrainian authorities should behave properly so that ukraine should not be drawn into military conflicts
6281757 i want the position of the ukrainian authorities to be deliberated so as the ukrainian territory should not be involved in any military tension this refers to the decrees on the black sea fleet
6281758 the national farmers federation appears to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and opposition spokesman on foreign affairs andrew robb rowing in the exact opposition direction
6281759 i think its time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether theyve got any policy on this
6281760 all i know is farmers organisations are saying to us ever since we came to government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6281761 this is their practical proposal and weve responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years
6281762 were concerned to know about health checks security checks compliance how we make sure theyre going to go back all of the issues you would expect that surround what is a significant and arguably the most significant change in immigration policy weve had in a generation in australia
6281763 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas
6281764 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6281765 but i think what brendan is referring to is the checks and balances that go on people coming into the country
6281766 we dont want to for instance import the crime problem of port moresby into australia weve got to make sure the checks and balances are correct
6281767 there was a concern of this sort of image of bringing in labour which is essentially of course to be frank about it non white labour to do jobs that people in australia simply didnt want to do
6281768 they didnt want to have a system in australia where you have a second tier of people who come to our country
6281769 not in my experience a word second graders use a lot
6281770 if we want to raise them lets raise them the minimum
6281771 a lot of small businesses say it is hurting them
6281772 a democratic country cannot have a coup if a country has huad a coup it is not democratic therefore my point that a democratic country provides stability for its rulers is true by definition
6281773 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6281774 a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6281775 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6281776 so we can get more time to come to an agreement we owe it to our citizens to try
6281777 after the surgery there was one point where i could hear everything that was going on around me but i couldnt open my eyes

6281782 the largest whale killed in australia was 22 metres and it was in western australia
6281783 as i brought the piece from there and i assume it came from that whale
6281784 seeing everyones faces i gave them the scrimshaw was worth all the effort to get them here
6281785 it has certainly added some very unique pieces to our collection
6281786 we have a lot of pieces but none sculptured apart from the baby rattle acquired last year
6281787 theyre pretty busy but they also have a lot of fun because this week is what theyve been working toward
6281788 on a typical day like this theyll probably be done about 5 in the afternoon
6281789 you get a lot of pride from the responsibility they show in taking care of their animals
6281790 its a lot of work but these kids know they need to take care of their animals
6281791 the data itself changes depending on the analysis that needs to be done
6281792 you seem to be assuming that the data is all there analysts decide after the fact how to analyze it
6281793 the key factor that makes them hard to handle relationally is the difficult ever changing nature of the analysis they need to support
6281794 were at war and if you arent doing anything wrong what have you got to hide
6281795 theres growing pressure to bring the myanmar case back to the un security council so we are not sitting quietly we are doing what we can do to help ensure a more credible process
6281796 this is a difficult issue and i dont expect much that there will be a big change in myanmar
6281797 myanmar claims to have a new constitution and these elections will be multi party elections but what is important for us at asean is to ensure that a more credible process is taking place

6281818 no one knows what his nutritional status was when he came into this area
6281819 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6281820 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6281821 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6281822 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6281823 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6281824 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6281825 letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6281826 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6281827 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6281828 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6281829 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful

6281844 we are constantly working to upgrade our portfolio and this didnt meet the standards weve set for ourselves or our members
6281845 we let the players have this morning off to rest but still had a very productive day in our meetings and out here at practice tonight
6281846 im real pleased with their effort through fall camp and tomorrow well start turning our full attention to texas a amp m and getting well
6281847 i thought we executed really well in a lot of phases of the game during practice
6281848 we had a lot of blitz stuff today some things on team and inside read zone type stuff i thought our team drills went well and then we had a scrimmage at the end for some of our young guys to get a little extra work weve got some younger guys in there we know are going to be players in the future whether they are ready to go now or not we dont know it just depends on if theyre called upon but got a lot of guys in that group we feel like are going to be very good
6281849 for a human to catch it there must be an extreme set of circumstances involving a sick horse
6281850 infected horses typically develop a respiratory illness and all three humans who have died have had intense extremely close contact with these horses and are exposed to the mucous in the same way a parent catches a bug off a sick child theyre caring for
6281851 were not talking just walking past a stable with an infected horse these are vets and farmers people who have stayed with the horse often through the night and caught the virus by breathing it in

6281866 but for every one of those ive had thousands of thank you for showing the world the real mexico
6281867 somehow people think that if youre raised by a family of a certain culture youll have a mastery itll be in your genes and thats not always true
6281868 and in a sense thats such a small part of it
6281869 for instance if you want to write about mole as a mexican you are obliged to say your grandmothers recipe is the only one thats the best and if you were to go to another town and say that mole is better than my grandmothers youd get run out of town on a rail but its not a problem for me because i dont have that mexican grandmother i can embrace all of mexico all the regions all the styles and bring it all together in one place
6281870 i can say i reach a lot of people that dont see eye to eye with me politically socially or anything yet when were at the table cooking an incredible paella over a wood fire we have the most amazing time all of a sudden all the differences fall away
6281871 i can bring people to the table with really beautifully crafted food as our country becomes more and more latino i think a real mexican table is really going to be an important step in sort of bringing the cultures together i cant help but think it will influence others to look at what mexican culture has done
6281872 the type of people who get in to stories are those who truly help stories move along have a particular knowledge and expertise
6281873 first you have to do your homework you have to learn the history
6281874 this is just how my mother makes it that doesnt make a story this is how it was created in this part of veracruz and it was made this way with that from there is the story
6281875 but its also really the flavors you have to be a good cook you gotta do all the rest of the work and have a good personal story and tell a good story about the food and you have to have inherent passion for what youre making
6281876 people love to be around passion its very important to talk about the food with this great verve
6281877 at warner park wed go out there a lot of times and there would be eight or nine different teams practicing and wed just divide up fields work together and everyone would use it and enjoy it

6281879 if they want to have a league on a certain day then fine but the rest of time everyone should be able to use it were all paying for the park its a very nice facility that nobody can use its just a waste of money
6281880 weve decided we are going to allow practices by permit only

6281885 robbie had problems in fine and gross motor skills and in sensory integration
6281886 mastery of flexibility and frustration tolerance is crucial to a childs overall development because interacting adaptively with the world requires the continual ability to solve problems work out disagreements and control the emotions one experiences when frustrated
6281887 hyper responsiveness to touch which was first identified by dr
6281888 positive attention smiles and laughter are social reinforcers that highly sensitive children desperately need these social reinforcers work slowly and have to occur repeatedly in order to significantly change a persons behavior
6281889 teaches children what not to do but not what to do
6281890 children do well if they can teachers need a new plan do help them do well
6281891 contrary to the belief that all of us experience basic sensations similarly we have found that children vary considerable in how they perceive sights sounds touch odors and movement patterns
6281892 some children are gifted in their ability to plan complex behaviors and movement patterns while others find even the most elementary sequencing of motor acts such as putting their fingers in their mouths a most perplexing task
6281893 the overly sensitive child can experience motor planning challenges the skills that are required to carry out a series of action sequences such as putting on socks or remembering a night time routine of brushing teeth putting on pajamas and kissing mom and dad goodnight
6281894 how many children are in this childs room what kind of furniture is in the room if there is a bench can the child physically support himself on a bench especially when the room is crowded and the noise level is very high
6281895 because sensitive children are so tuned into sensations they tend to experience the world in little pieces
6281896 think of the compare the brain to a large city with traffic consisting of neural impulses good sensory processing enables all the impulses to flow easily and reach their destination quickly sensory integrative dysfunction is a sort of traffic jam in the brain some bits of sensory information get tied up in traffic and certain parts of the brain do not get the sensory information they need to do their jobs
6281897 imagine how you would feel if you attended a rock concert after staying up at night consuming cup after cup of strong coffee the sound would probably ground right through you while the flashing lights and crowded bodies would be bewildering overwhelming many overly sensitive children feel this way every day as if they have little barrier between themselves and the rest of the world they feel as if things are happening to them rather than feeling they have much control over their life while our senses can give us pleasure they are entirely difficult for the highly sensitive child a friendly touch might feel harsh to her certain sounds may seem to come out of a bull horn certain smells seem oppressive even bright colors can overwhelm
6281898 clumsy disorganized behavior which creates a sense of failure that only adds to their distress this child can rarely describe his sensory experiences t others because he has no internal baseline with which to compare them he has poor adaptive behavior an inability to respond to new circumstances especially when expectations are high and new people are involved
6281899 if you interpret this childs behavior as planned intentional and purposeful then use labels such as stubborn willful manipulative bratty attention seeking out of control and defiant then popular strategies at motivating compliant behavior and teaching the child who the boss is will make perfect sense
6281900 it is essential we create a community of learners by emphasizing a social curriculum as much as we do an academic curriculum
6281901 children with sensory processing disorders experience the world differently they may have extreme discomfort or pain from sensations that other people might find pleasant this is a functional disorder remember it is not the childs fault nor can he control the problem
6281902 throughout my life hes always been mayor i see him kind of as the father of grapevine

6281905 i ask people hey what do you think about one of these solutions that the governor proposed

6281907 im hoping for the blog to be a way for me to reach out
6281908 we are examining the order and will evaluate our next step
6281909 we are in a trial and final results of that are yet unknown which is why we do trials
6281910 the important point is that the intent of network management has and continues to be to provide a great experience for our customers
6281911 inconsistent with the concept of an open and accessible internet

6281914 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6281915 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6281916 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6281917 let no one suffer the illusion that 126 billion has gone straight to where it is needed and where it belongs

6281919 but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify
6281920 that senator john mccain and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed
6281921 i cooperated fully and completely with the senate indian affairs committees investigation and was never accused of doing anything improper
6281922 it is just sad that the obama campaign which once pledged to run on hope and change is now resorting to the politics of personal destruction and fear and smear as obama drops in polls
6281923 a lot of chutzpah for someone who did real estate deals with tony rezko to attack others
6281924 merely sent out an e mail with pro forma language used by anyone asking others to support senator mccain
6281925 i understand he sent out an e mail on his own which i guess is your right as a citizen

6281950 this year republicans and democrats have talked a lot about reforming the system and fixing the system but i think its time for the dialogue to stop and to create some action

6281988 after a whirlwind courtship fairy tale wedding and two years of marriage the first lady of turks amp caicos actress lisa raye mccoy misick and premier michael misick have separated and are headed for divorce court
6281989 on august 14 2008 mccoy misick was taken to the islands police department by her publicist lynn jeter of lynn allen jeter and associates and her personal bodyguard and cousin phillip travis
6281990 according to jeter the actress had returned to turks amp caicos for a scheduled meeting with her and misicks lawyers in hopes to reach a temporary spousal support agreement until their divorce is finalized the chi town native believed all had gone well until she learned that misick and his lawyer reneged on the settlement it wasnt until she returned to the presidential palace where she stayed in a separate bedroom the week prior that for unknown reasons she was refused entry and allegedly physically forced to leave the property jeter explains
6281991 despite reports that rep was also involved in the incident jeter denies allegations that she assaulted anyone
6281992 i dont do drama and altercations unless its verbal because i can mediate that
6281993 since then the first lady and premier have each released personal statements alleging that both were assaulted by individuals from the other partys entourage reportedly mccoy misick sustained injuries including a
6281994 and is working to get this matter resolved quickly as she moves forward with her career
6281995 photos of alleged injuries from a source close to the situation who asked not to be identified
6281996 despite allegations of corruption and rape charges against the premier which misick strongly denies mccoy misick has never publicly spoken about the charges against her husband but she recently released a statement announcing their separation
6281997 i ask that my privacy be respected in these difficult times and i believe that the people of the turks amp caicos islands will understand and support my wish to receive the necessary independent representation from the legal counsel of my choosing i hope that in time the turks amp caicos islands government will come to share that view although i have always been a supportive wife even in light of the very serious allegations currently pending against the premier there are limits even for me

6282029 destroying capitalist ownership transforming it into socialist ownership by the whole people and destroying individual ownership transforming it into socialist collective ownership
6282030 the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie the class struggle between various political forces and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field will still be long and torturous and at times even very sharp
6282031 basically the socialist system has been established in our country we have won basic victory in transforming the ownership of the means of production but on the political and ideological fronts we are farther from complete victory
6282032 the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and between the socialist road and the capitalist road is the principal contradiction in socialist society
6282033 in order to keep improving and developing the socialist system and to prevent the restoration of capitalism
6282034 it is necessary not only to bring about the socialist industrialization of the country and persevere in the socialist revolution on the economic front but also to carry on constant and arduous socialist revolutionary struggles and socialist education on the political and ideological fronts moreover various complimentary international conditions are required
6282035 in an era in which classes and class struggle still exist both at home and abroad the working class and the masses who have seized state power must suppress the resistance to the revolution put up by all counter revolutionary classes groups and individuals thwart their activities aimed at restoration and prohibit them from exploiting freedom of speech for counter revolutionary purposes
6282036 is a struggle waged by the working people under the leadership of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie
6282037 the proletariat in china is small in number some 10 million only and it must rely on the several hundred million poor peasants lower middle peasants city poor poor handicraftsmen and revolutionary intellectuals in order to exercise dictatorship otherwise it cannot
6282038 though small in number the working class and it alone has a great future the other classes are all classes in transition through which they must go in the direction of the working class
6282039 the emergence of the anti party alliance of kao kang and jao shu shih was by no means accidental but was an acute manifestation of the intense class struggle in our country at the present stage the criminal aim of this anti party alliance was to split our party and seize supreme power in the party and the state by conspiratorial means thus paving the way for a counter revolutionary comeback
6282040 with the battle ground both inside and outside the party
6282041 they are in the nature of things and will always happen
6282042 for revolution it is always better to have more people except for a few who cling to their mistakes and fail to mend their ways after repeated admonition the majority of those who have erred can correct their mistakes
6282043 it is passive just to observe conditions must be created to help those who have erred to mend their ways a clear distinction must be drawn between right and wrong for inner party controversies over principle are a reflection inside the party of class struggle in society and no equivocation is to be tolerated it is normal in accordance with the merits of the case to mete out appropriate and well grounded criticism to comrades who have erred and even to conduct necessary struggle against them this is to help them correct mistakes to deny them help and what is worse to gloat over their mistakes is sectarianism
6282044 our party has millions of experienced cadres most of them are good cadres born and brought up in our native land linked to the masses and tested in the course of long struggles we have a whole body of cadres those who joined the revolution in the period of the northern expedition during the war of the agrarian revolution the war of resistance against japan the war of liberation and those who joined after the nation wide liberation they are all valuable assets to our country
6282045 with such cadres as ours who have been tested in different periods of the revolution we are able to sit tight in the fishing boat despite the rising wind and waves
6282046 we must do our best to mobilize all positive factors both inside and outside the party both at home and abroad both direct and indirect and build china into a powerful socialist country
6282047 the capitalist road can also lead to increased production but the time required would be longer and the course painful
6282048 the productive forces are the most revolutionary factor when the productive forces have developed there is bound to be a revolution
6282049 the social and technical transformation of the rural areas will proceed simutaneously
6282050 strive to be proficient in technical and professional work turn themselves into experts and become both red and expert
6282051 politics and professions form a unity of opposites in which politics is predominate and primary and we must fight against the tendency to ignore politics but it wont do to confine oneself to politics and have no technical or professional knowledge what ever line our comrades are in whether it is in industry agriculture commerce or culture and education they should all acquire some technical and professional knowledge
6282052 strive to become expert in in political and economic work for which the prerequisite is a higher level of marxism leninism they must do well in both political and ideological work and in economic construction as for the latter we must really get to know how to do it
6282053 some people are white like the rightists in the party who are politically white and technically inexpert
6282054 everybody should study hard where ever possible they should strive to acquire technical skill and vocational knowledge and study marxist theory so that a new army of working class intellectuals will be formed including all the intellectuals from the old society who take a firm working class stand after having been genuinely remoulded
6282055 this is a great task history sets us the revolutionary cause of the working class will not be fully consolidated until this vast new army of working class intellectuals comes into being
6282056 this is an obligation you have such a big population such a vast territory and such rich resources and what is more it has been said that you are building socialism which is supposed to be superior if after much ado for 50 or 60 years you are still unable to overtake the united states what a sorry figure you will cut you should be read off the face of the earth therefore to overtake the united states it is not only possible but obligatory if we dont we the chinese nation will be letting the nations of the world down and we will not be making much of a contribution to mankind
6282057 the quarterback rotation will be the same for chicago on thursday we have a short week to prepare and i want to keep the team focused on the bears
6282058 the starters will most likely play the first half with the second unit coming in during the third quarter
6282059 were just at that point where we are getting closer to the regular season so you want to start easing into a normal work week
6282060 plus its a short week with a game on thursday already
6282061 once the season starts and we are installing they throw the whole book at us so this is good practice and will give guys a better idea of the way coach martz does things
6282062 its great to get more opportunities to get timing down with the quarterbacks whether its j t alex or shaun
6282063 i love being out there ive been prepping myself for this opportunity i did hurt my groin in the first game but i was able to bounce back and i felt fresh last week in the game and im trying to make the most of my playing time
6282064 i think those kind of plays are plays that i can do when im healthy
6282065 this is a fast league and so its difficult to make those plays when you are a wounded duck it was good to be healthy and in that situation where i could make a play and hopefully i can make some more
6282066 it evens out the playing field a little bit because offenses cant check with you as much when there was no headset we had to corral guys on the sideline then we had to relay to guys standing in the huddle what the call was now i can say it immediately and guys can start moving out it helps us with everything adjustments its easier for us to get the calls in and its easier for us to make substitutions as well
6282067 thats something i hope we see a lot of all season long
6282068 i think one of these days im going to go get a hair cut
6282069 they needed extra time to make tights for you big guys
6282070 we are basically double teaming the nose tackle to the mike linebacker
6282071 we use it when the linebacker is not a fast flow player so we can try to double the nose and get him off the line
6282072 youve got to be square if they turn their shoulders at all theyll never be able to adjust to the linebacker
6282073 sight is also important they can never lose sight of the backer or what is coming at them
6282074 if the d linemen i start off working on runs away from me hes no longer a threat to me
6282075 what is a threat at that point is usually going to be the defensive end
6282076 you might have your hands on that nose but you want to have your eyes trained on what is coming from the other direction
6282077 so youve got to have good peripheral vision and spatial awareness
6282078 we can get huge plays on those cutback runs if we block it right
6282079 every defensive uses a different scheme and its just a matter of us being prepared and knowing what to do when we get into a game
6282080 hopefully he gets better quick but at the same time ive got to do my thing i will go in there when needed and i expect myself to be ready
6282081 entscheidend ist nicht die medaillenz hlerei sondern das leistungsverm gen jedes athleten
6282082 und bisher haben sich alle starter im bereich ihrer bestleistung bewegt oder sie bertroffen
6282083 der eine hat die erwartung erf llt der andere sie sogar bertroffen
6282084 wir haben keine supergirls und supermen am start und erlebnisse wie mit dem zehnkampf silber f r frank busemann 1996 oder hochspringern ulrike meyfarth die nach 1972 auch 1984 olympia gold holte sind uns heute aber selten geg nnt
6282085 nat rlich hoffen wir darauf denn unser ziel ist besser als in athen 2004 mit zwei silbermedaillen abzuschneiden
6282086 da haben wir lieber keinen sportler am start als einen der f r aufsehen und zweifel sorgt

6282110 the substantial growth we found in indoor tanning facilities and services is likely to still underestimate the true size of the industry
6282111 some services are offered without being advertised in the yellow pages such as those at some hotels and motels
6282112 there has also been evidence of irresponsibility among some new zealand industry providers
6282113 we know we have to do something to get the industry working properly we want to make sure people arent tanning incorrectly
6282114 improving sexual health is a government health priority so increasing the range of condoms available can only be good in terms of encouraging safe sex practices
6282115 condoms are already funded and always have been this decision sees a 10 percent price reduction for all condoms which frees up funds that can be used to purchase other new medicines
6282116 morally bankrupt and an insult to people with breast cancer high blood pressure and heart disease
6282117 at a time when pharmac cant find funding for sufferers of breast cancer heart disease high blood pressure and other serious problems that they can find funding to subsidise flavoured condoms
6282118 this is simply about funding sexual behaviour that shouldnt be at the cost of the taxpayer or other more life threatening medication

6282183 they just didnt like the way the cemetery was being run and so they tried to take it over and do something about it and it just cost too much

6282189 super sunday dawn my recollections of the last twelve hours are very dim all that i know for certain is that shortly after i checked in two third world drug abusers dressed as hotel employees forced their way into my room ransacked it drank all my liquor did all my drugs stole my dinner the security precautions arent beefed up at this hotel im looking for safer accomodations its a sad state of affairs when this reporter has to go heavily armed to breakfast

6282191 our experience has been and its drawn principally from iraq that when you are in an area for a while people will eventually come to trust you they rely on your security they will give you intelligence and expect you to continue to provide that security
6282192 what happens when you come back is that theres not a level of trustworthiness that youve had there among the people because you did this once before
6282193 when we leave they will either go back to being farmers or will be killed

6282199 itll spark problems in colorado when someone in arizona talks about revisiting things
6282200 thats generally interpreted as meaning that arizona wants more of colorados water
6282201 would never damage the state of colorados rights over the water
6282202 in a purple state like colorado republicans cant afford those
6282203 we dont vote for water rustlers thieves in this state we tar and feather them
6282204 for mccain to suggest particularly on the heels of last years renegotiation of the compact that we keep talking about it whatever he meant it struck me as more than just a small misstep

6282206 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change
6282207 my real age is 16 i dont care about what other people say its none of their business
6282208 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegation of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely i believe that these primary documents issued by the chinese state directly available from china by clicking on the links above rise to a level of evidence higher than allegations
6282209 how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china
6282210 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes

6282230 were paying artists a stipend and were feeding them so no ones going to lose money by coming to this festival but if they make money thats entirely up to them thats the way street performing is its a matter of survival and it makes better shows if you ask me
6282231 any act can show up and just do their thing
6282232 we shouldnt have to wait until thanksgiving or christmas to feel that good feeling you get when everyone is together
6282233 i remember when church and family reunions were the backbone of our community
6282234 it will bring back that summertime fun when people could come together despite their problems and let their cares go we have to bring back that togetherness
6282235 when the kids start pulling at you you have something for them to do thats right there

6282402 it could be that skeletonema is degrading karenias allelopathic chemicals just like it degrades brevetoxins or it could be that skeletonema is stressing karenia out making it harder to produce allelopathic chemicals
6282403 we observed that when we took seawater and added purified brevetoxins to it the live algae didnt suffer much so there must be other chemicals released by the red tide that are toxic to these algae
6282404 what we do know is that this diatom s costatum is able to undermine these toxins produced by the red tide as well as the brevetoxins that are known to kill vertebrate animals like fish and dolphins

6282441 the appointment of a contractor with no solid financial background has affected the projects implementation schedule and the quality of the houses built
6282442 no technical officers were assigned to monitor the implementation of these projects

6282456 this is a tax on energy production that will raise the price of oil for all americans at a time when they can least afford it
6282457 republicans that vote for tax increases like this are rat heads in coke bottles
6282458 they ruin the brand for all other members and undermine the current efforts in the house to bring pelosi back and vote on drilling which will actually help
6282459 their plan not only raises taxes but it only allows four states to opt in to a government run drilling program in the continental shelf has no mention of anwr or shale oil and places choke hold restrictions on auto manufacturers that they realistically cannot meet

6282476 infected horses typically develop a respiratory illness and all three humans who have died have had intense extremely close contact with these horses and are exposed to the mucous in the same way a parent catches a bug off a sick child theyre caring for

6282495 pinamanahan niya ako ng credit card pero ang credit card na yon ay walang lamang pera kundi pangalan lang ni fpj ang sabi niya ang maipapamana lang niya sa akin ay ang kanyang malinis na pangalan at yon ang ipinagmamalaki ko unlike a credit card hindi ko na kailangan itong bayaran ng pera

6282509 weve never viewed these games simply as 16 days of spectacular olympic or paralympic sport
6282510 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
6282511 its a mistake to think that games model themselves on previous games every games ive been to has been very different
6282512 the days of just leaving 90 000 seater stadia particularly in london where youd have two with the new wembley stadium are over
6282513 you have to provide something for local communities to do more than simply press their noses up against
6282514 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing
6282515 were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium for which weve been discussing a number of anchor tenancies as well as possibly an educational legacy or even an entertainment legacy
6282516 weve been looking at the legacy from the very moment our teams started looking at the master plans
6282517 yeah its definitely true that weve had a lot of requests for a port for the wii and its definitely doable we just dont have any plans for it yet thats all if we feel strongly enough that it would sell id imagine wed do it

6282538 if we were to regard russia less as a rampant bear to be contained and more as a commercial competitor to be competed with
6282539 russia is never as strong as it seems nor is week as it seems to be
6282540 not for nothing have russian troops been firmly and visibly in possession of gori the georgian town at which the baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline hinges from azerbaijan to the east to turkey in the south
6282541 i dont think so the baku supsa pipeline runs by gori not the baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline thats 40km or so to the south what a relief to read an article that is based on a calm analysis of economic reality the countries of western and central europe have far more to gain from constructive economic and political engagement both the long term interests of the russian federation and their existing trading partners must be clearly identified and reconciled with the complex nationality problem that has existed throughout central and eastern europe tzars and kaisers could not resolve the nationality problem hitler and stalin compounded the nationality problem only in the creation of the european union have we been able to move forward to answer the nationality problem we now need a new institutional framework whose geographical centre is significantly east of brussels or even berlin that will engage the russian federation and the countries on its borders plus its trading partners can finland be persuaded to lead a constructive dialogue yes saakashvili should have spent his military budget on the development of tourism small business etc etc not only to improve the lot of his people but to entice the belligerent separatists perhaps he could have got away with joining the eu but nato no way is it possible to have the one without the other unfortunately hes got himself involved in a much bigger game in which america seems to want to control the strategic resources of the entire planet including those of belligerent russia and her immediate neighbours it all appears to be a battle of lifestyles in which the predator offers his victims mountains of credit to buy protection and irresistable trinkets in exchange for natural resources and everlasting debt slavery well something along those lines anyway anyone got any idea about the wonderful improvement of georgias economy under saakashvilis stewardship the poland missiles deal has been signed yesterday condy said

6282555 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6282556 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6282567 for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6282568 this clear legal precedent signals that the future of the net neutrality debate will be over how not whether to protect users right to an open internet
6282569 the communications act has long established the federal agencys authority to promote the competition consumer choice and diverse information across all communications platforms
6282570 extended these rights to internet users including the right to access the lawful content applications and services of their choice
6282571 the decision shows that the agency understands the importance of the technological principles of the internets design
6282572 the internet is a world wide system that does not belong to any one operator
6282573 the design of the internet protocols specifies clear limits on what operators can and cannot do happily the fcc recognized and exposed comcasts transgressions of those limits

6282577 the secretary general firmly believes that violence will not deter the people of algeria from the path of peace and national reconciliation
6282578 the terrorists should know that the only way for them is to give themselves up
6282579 as the president of the republic has said many times the state will unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6282580 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation chosen by the nation and which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6282581 sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria
6282582 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures

6282846 fay is still a threat and we are watching this very closely
6282847 this is a serious catastrophic event particularly for southern brevard county this area is seeing historic levels of rain
6282848 we are moving more resources in to support the most heavily impacted counties
6282849 the most significant issue regarding the slow motion is that fay will likely continue to dump torrential rains along its path and will probably be remembered as a very wet storm
6282850 we ask people to seriously consider it but were not going to force anybody to leave their home
6282851 but we didnt need it all at once it wouldve been nice to spread it out over time
6282852 these counties are currently in the process of harvesting these crops and rainfall produced from fay may jeopardize the entire crop

6282857 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6282858 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6282859 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6282860 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6282861 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6282862 its fun to win anywhere but to be able to do it in all three series at various race tracks it means a lot
6282863 i saved it three times before it looped i ran out of talent in the end
6282864 so you try to make sure they know that youre intelligent and not horrible then you try to be rugged and sexy but only after smart and lovable
6282865 i can safely say i dont know if its meant to happen it will i love and adore being a mother
6282866 i understand that raising children is universally difficult and that people read an article hoping for something worthwhile in it the truth is i am not on some inside track i have no incredible revelations to share
6282867 i crave structure ive never had good habits or a formula for how to shape a day a month a life i appreciate anything that makes me focus
6282868 confidence intelligence and goodness theres nothing sexier than that combination
6282869 we had no such talks as far as i know
6282870 in fact this year we will focus on our domestic business asit seems there are no signs when the u s credit problems mayeventually end

6282884 what it does is hold the business owner accountable for the actions of his bar and his employees and his establishment
6282885 these are the main problems that we see in bars that concern us as to the safety of our citizens and the ability for us to do our jobs properly
6282886 i think it sends the message that the city has the will to make sure that these businesses are going to play by the rules and that everyone understands now that the rules apply to everybody
6282887 the statehood green party not the democratic or republican parties stands with the people of washington dc in our demand for the real citizenship democratic self government and full representation in congress that all other americans enjoy
6282888 were dismayed that democrats dcs largest political party have abandoned the goal of statehood
6282889 we dispute ms nortons assertion that dc is not ready for statehood and were unhappy that ms nortons submission to the democratic platform draft omits mention of statehood were as ready for statehood as everyone else in the us who already lives in a state
6282890 unlike the 2004 democratic platform the 2008 draft doesnt even endorse democratic self government the draft says we deserve the benefits of full citizenship especially the vote that are accorded to citizens of every state without explaining what these things mean or how theyre to be achieved its like saying every child deserves to be educated but refusing to endorse public schools especially the vote is even more ambiguous we already have the right to vote for president for our local elected officials and for our nonvoting delegate to the house but were still being under the boot of congress
6282891 talking points quotes on dc voting rights bill dc statehood and democracy
6282892 we support statehood for the district of columbia the residents of d c must have the same rights and representation as all other us citizens
6282893 our civil rights leaders sacrificed too much over the years for us to tolerate denial to the nearly 600 000 residents of our nations capital of the benefits of full citizenship especially the vote that are accorded to citizens of every state
6282894 as we encourage democracy around the world we must extend democracy here at home we support equal rights to democratic self government and congressional representation for the citizens of our nations capital
6282895 as a pastor i know that you can learn a lot about a mans character based on how he treats his family
6282896 barack is a strong man of christian faith who has been married to his wife michelle for 16 years
6282897 he understands the pressures families are under and what it takes to help families thrive
6282898 what they describe in the ad could describe millions of american men
6282899 just go to a promise keepers event and the stadiums full of them but that doesnt mean all of those men are qualified to be president the question i would think that religious leaders would be asking is what is this mans views on issues whats his christian worldview on issues
6282900 i dont think that most pastors in this country those who believe the bible is the word of god and interpret that through what we know is a traditional christian worldview are going to be able to just close their eyes to the radical pro abortion position of senator obama
6282901 this is a man who has pledged to sign a freedom of choice act that would overturn every pro life law state local national in the nation
6282902 any uncertainty relating to the proposed restructure should be removed as soon as possible
6282903 as promised prior to the last election the government has undertaken an extensive consultation process to assess the impact of the introduction of vsu by the former liberal government
6282904 the rudd government is committed to ensuring that university students have access to vital campus services including childcare healthcare counselling and sporting facilities
6282905 as the minister confirmed very recently we are not considering a return to compulsory student union fees
6282906 vsu has cost the unversity sector a significant amount that would otherwise go to teaching and research
6282907 one of the services that has suffered is university sport now around half of the australian olympics team has a tie to the university sector and have depended on the quality of university sporting facilities for some part of their careers
6282908 we have indicated we are not proposing to do something that is compulsory
6282909 but we are looking at ways to ensure that we can revive services on campuses non academic services that in many parts of australia have been seriously eroded by the changes the howard government has made

6282914 we have cancelled some flights certainly substituted aircraft and we had delays for passengers just as every airline does

6282923 but hes been here now for several days adults of course go for months without food but a calf youd think it was days more than weeks
6282924 what theyre all telling us is that it is not actually physically possible to look after a whale like this pretty much anywhere else let alone in australia
6282925 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6282926 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6282927 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6282928 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is
6282929 letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6282930 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild
6282931 thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6282932 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6282933 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful

6283085 there is huge demand for mobile applications from consumers who make up the vast majority of the mobile phone population

6283090 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
6283091 for us in india we conceptualize god as an all pervasive divine and see his myriad manifestations in everything around us i see universe as an emanation of that divine for me the miracle of being a human being is the possibility to access that divine in our own conscience
6283092 i believe that man still in an intermediate stage between the animal and the divine can raise himself to a higher plane of being if he makes a conscious and dedicated effort to do so and that there is no nobler endeavor than this aspiration towards divinity
6283093 i am not superstitious and would not wear all kinds of charms just like that
6283094 youre not supposed to speak to people you dont know are you
6283095 many people ask how do i get traffic to my website
6283096 i started writing about the history of this friendship and all the good that i see in him but wait a minute why am i writing this and not going to actually check in on him i think i need to go and practice what i am trying to preach
6283097 i want to tell you that i dont want to talk to you
6283098 they said traffic was being stopped and then they came up with we cant have a roadside stand and then they said it was a commercial enterprise
6283099 they may start out with a little card table and selling a couple of things but then who is to say what else they have is all the produce made there do they make it themselves are they going to have eggs and chickens for sale next
6283100 lemonade stands are technically illegal but they dont last long enough to do anything about

6283108 i also hope to work closely with your right honorable during your tenure to further strengthen the friendly ties between our two countries
6283109 the life i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god
6283110 it would be a great pity dear brethren if in the process of being qualified for the next life we became disqualified for this but it is not so it would be a very strange thing if in order to be fit for the company of angels we should grow unfit to associate with men but it is not so it would be a singular circumstance if those who speak of heaven had nothing to say concerning the way thither but it is not so my brethren true religion has as much to do with this world as with the world to come it is always urging us onward to the higher and better life but it does so by processes and precepts which fit us worthily to spend our days while here below godliness prepares us for the life which follows the laying down of this mortal flesh but as paul tells us in the text it moulds the life which we now live in the flesh faith is a principle for present use godliness with contentment is great gain it hath the promise of the life that now is as well as of that which is to come the sphere of faith is earth and heaven time and eternity the sweep of its circle takes in the whole of our being spirit soul and body it comprehends the past and the future and it certainly does not omit the present with the things that now are the faith of christians has to do and it is concerning the life that we now live in the flesh that i shall now speak trying by the help of gods spirit to show the influence which faith has upon it
6283111 faith inclines a man to an industrious life it suggests activity i will venture to say of any lazy man that he has little or no faith in god for faith always worketh by love i lay it down as a thesis which shall be proved by observation that a believing man becomes an active man or else it is because he cannot act and therefore what would have been activity runs into the channel of patience and he endures with resignation the will of the most high he who does nothing believes nothing that is to say in reality and in truth faith is but an empty show if it produces no result upon the life if a professor manifests no energy no industry no zeal no perseverance no endeavour to serve god there is cause gravely to question whether he is a believer at all it is a mark of faith that whenever it comes into the soul even in its lowest degree it suggests activity look at the prodigal and note his early desires the life of grace begins to gleam into his spirit and its first effect is the confession of sin he cries father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son but what is the second effect he desires to be doing something make me as one of thy hired servants having nothing to do had helped to make him the prodigal he was he had wasted his substance in riotous idleness seeking enjoyment without employment he had plunged into the foulest vices because he was master of money but not master of himself it was not an ill thing for him when he was sent into the fields to feed swine the company which he met with at the swine trough was better than that which he had kept at his banquets one of the signs of the return of his souls sanity was his willingness to work although it might be only as a menial servant in his fathers house in actual history observe how saul of tarsus even before he had found peaceful faith in christ cried lord what wilt thou have me to do faith arouses the soul to action it is the first question of believing anxiety sirs what must i do to be saved hence faith is such a useful thing to men in the labour and travail of this mortal life because it puts them into motion and supplies them with a motive for work faith does not permit men to lie upon the bed of the sluggard listless frivolous idle but it makes life to appear real and earnest and so girds the loins for the race
6283112 by the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread
6283113 everyone should follow an honourable vocation it was a rule of the old church and it ought to be one of the present if any man will not work neither let him eat it is good for us all to have something to do and plenty of it when man was perfect god placed him in a paradise but not in a dormitory he set him in the garden to dress it and to keep it it would not have been a happy place for adam if he had had nothing to do but to smell the roses and gaze at the flowers work was as essential to the perfect man as it is to us though it was not of the kind which brings sweat to the face or weariness to the limbs in the garden of grace faith is set to a happy service and never wishes to be otherwise than occupied for her lord
6283114 the text says the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god does faith in the son of god who loved him and gave himself for him suggest to the redeemed man that he should be industrious and active assuredly it does for it sets the divine saviour before him as an example and where was there ever one who worked as jesus did in his early youth he said wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business he was no loitering heir of a gentleman but the toiling son of a carpenter in after life it was his meat and his drink to do the will of him that sent him he says my father worketh hitherto and i work his was stern labour and sore travail the zeal of gods house did eat him up and the intensity of love consumed him he worked on until he could say i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do now it is no small thing for a man to be roused by such an example and to be made a partaker of such a spirit

6283118 can you come here your grandfather is talking about buying you a flute
6283119 you had mentioned that you were looking at getting an alto flute
6283120 im not sure its worth the money for the one time a year its going to come out of the case
6283121 well then maybe the smart thing is to upgrade your c flute
6283122 maybe you should talk to your accountant before you dive into one of these
6283123 let me put my flute away and then i need to do some research
6283124 no this is all going to happen on line theres no place anywhere around here that would carry such an instrument
6283125 hmmm well i know people who play haynes powells do you have a budget
6283126 not really not a specified one yours is a powell right
6283127 yes definitely and i would definitely go for solid silver if the skys the limit have fun
6283128 what i would suggest is find the one that you would want if cost wasnt an issue then go down from there
6283129 i did but there werent any there that were under 30k and im not comfortable asking for that
6283130 im really biased towards haynes i dont know why maybe its because my high school flute teacher played one or maybe i just like the logo
6283131 this is an instrument that she shouldnt have to ever upgrade it will be the last flute shell ever need

6283151 i know anything that involves the thp is juicy fodder
6283152 but the last couple of years theyve done an awful lot to clean that place up
6283153 we can see the youngest one the 11 year old at the gun store taking guns
6283154 its amazing that an 11 year old kid would think of being involved in something like that

6283175 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6283176 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6283177 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6283178 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6283179 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6283180 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long

6283184 defensively we were more organized and i thought that started with our center backs it was good to get a win even in an exhibition
6283185 hopefully it will get us on a roll for saturday
6283186 for the chances we had i thought our forwards converted on those chances
6283187 it was good to get all the players time and some of the younger players played really well
6283188 for many reasons mainly concerning my age health and decreasing energy levels i have taken the decision to stand down as mp for keighley at the next general election
6283189 my campaigns on behalf of some of our most vulnerable people are coming to fruition the forced marriage civil protection act comes into effect in september
6283190 i would like to thank the people of my constituency who it has been an absolute privilege to represent for the last 11 years in parliament
6283191 of course none of us are aware of when the next election will be called but my work and that of my office will continue on behalf of constituents until then
6283192 i will also be doing all i can to help promote whoever is selected as labours parliamentary candidate for the next election illustrating the difference labour has made for the keighley constituency to ensure it continues to have a labour mp after the next election
6283193 ann cryer has been a distinguished servant of the people of keighley for many years first assisting her late husband bob cryer who represented the seat between 1974 and 1983 and then as the labour mp for the seat since 1997
6283194 she knows every inch of her constituency and her understanding of its communities is second to none
6283195 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now
6283196 the census has been around for 200 years and it is no longer gathering the right sort of data for modern public services

6283215 weve seen the whitebox server market growing towards the end of 2007 and its continuing to grow quarter on quarter
6283216 australia is an smb marketplace and theres a tremendous amount of businesses sitting within comapnies that have up to 10 employees
6283217 typically whitebox servers also come in at a lower price point than their branded competitors
6283218 the average system value has gone up significantly and thats because of virtualisation systems are going out with a really rich high end configuration for virtualised deployments

6283229 u s stocks with a good representation of smaller growth companies
6283230 for most people i recommend broad based total stock market index funds rather than individual stocks for portfolio formation
6283231 then there are small cap value index funds and large cap growth funds
6283232 u s stocks with a good representation of smaller growth companies
6283233 a random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past actions
6283234 on wall street the term random walk is an obscenity
6283235 i wrote in the first edition that a blindfolded chimpanzee throwing darts at the wall street journal could select a portfolio that would do as well as the experts
6283236 through the past thirty years more than two thirds of professional portfolio managers have been outperformed by the unmanaged s amp p 500 index
6283237 all too many investors are lazy and careless a terrifying combination when greed gets control of the market and everyone wants to cash in on the latest craze or fad
6283238 it is not really hard to make money in the market
6283239 with index funds you know exactly what you are getting and the investment process is made incredibly simple
6283240 the most important decision you will probably ever make concerns the balancing of asset categories stocks bonds real estate money market securities etc at different stages of your life
6283241 according to roger ibbotson more than 90 of an investors total return is determined by the asset categories that are selected and their overall proportional representation
6283242 in the 1990s the ratio of buy to sell recommendations climbed to 100 to 1 particularly by brokerage firms with large investment banking businesses
6283243 stock investors can do no better than simply buying and holding a fund that owns a representative sample of all the stocks in the market
6283244 i am convinced that no one will be successful in using technical methods to get above average returns in the stock market
6283245 simply buying and holding a diversified portfolio suited to your objectives will enable you to save on investment expense brokerage charges and taxes
6283246 every investor must decide the trade off he or she is willing to make between eating well and sleeping well
6283247 again and again yesterdays star fund has proven to be todays disaster
6283248 the laws of chance do operate and they can explain some amazing success stories
6283249 it turns out that the portfolio with the least risk 1970 2002 had 24 foreign securities and 76 u s securities
6283250 what worked in the past does not necessarily work in the future
6283251 i strongly suggest you invest some of your assets in reits
6283252 the current inventory of gold is some 50 times its annual industrial requirement
6283253 beta as it is usually measured is not a substitute for brains
6283254 there is never going to be a handsome genie who will appear and solve all our investment problems
6283255 buying and holding a broad based market index fund is still the only game in town
6283256 any truly repetitive and exploitable pattern that can be discovered in the stock market and can be arbitraged away will self destruct
6283257 given enough time and massaging of data series it is possible to tease almost any pattern out of most data sets
6283258 clearly buying a portfolio of small firms is hardly a surefire technique to enable an investor to earn abnormally high risk adjusted returns
6283259 over a period running back to the 1930s it does not appear that investors could actually have realized higher rates of return from mutual funds specializing in value stocks
6283260 i am convinced that many studies have been flawed by the phenomenon of survivorship bias
6283261 the more profitable any return predictability appears to be the less likely it is to survive
6283262 i have yet to see any compelling evidence that past stock prices can be used to predict future stock prices
6283263 never buy anything from someone who is out of breath
6283264 the decision of which ira is best for you and whether to convert can be a tough call
6283265 for investors who are very risk averse i favor gnma funds
6283266 own your own home if you can possibly afford it
6283267 if your expected investment period is only for a decade or less no one can predict the returns you will receive with any degree of accuracy
6283268 there aint no such thing as a free lunch higher risk is the price one pays for more generous returns
6283269 switching your investment around in a futile attempt to time the market will only involve extra commissions for your broker extra taxes for the government and poorer net performance
6283270 dollar cost averaging can reduce the risks of investing in stocks and bonds
6283271 dont think that dollar cost averaging will solve all of your problems
6283272 what goes down must come back up but this does not necessarily hold for individual stocks just for the market in general
6283273 the key to whether any recommended asset allocation works for you is whether you are able to sleep at night
6283274 for most people i recommend broad based total stock market index funds rather than individual stocks for portfolio formation
6283275 i have become increasingly convinced that the past records of mutual fund managers are essentially worthless in predicting future success
6283276 luck may be 99 percent responsible for the success of the very few people who have beaten the averages
6283277 the mutual fund industry has developed a system of charging expenses to investors that is as complicated as irs income tax regulations and equally unpleasant
6283278 i have often said that the two best things that have happened to the mutual fund industry are the arrival of jack bogle of vanguard and don phillips of morningstar
6283279 my son is a little more japanese looking and my daughter is a bit more american

6283292 im dreaming dreams im scheming schemes im building castles high
6283293 im forever blowing bubbles pretty bubbles in the air they fly so high nearly reach the sky then like my dreams they fade and die
6283294 that the internet and the housing hyperinflations transpired within a period of 10 years each creating trillions of fake wealth is i believe only the beginning
6283295 there will and must be many more such booms for without them the united states can no longer function the bubble cycle has replaced the business cycle
6283296 they say they are willing to run but since that time ive had one decline i have the names of five people who would like to take the emt training quite frankly i put this on hold because i was chairing the homecoming festival i couldnt do two things at once i was going to bring it up tonight to see what we want to do with the five people who want to take the emt training

6283301 mesti waktu akan mampu memanggil seluruh ragaku ku ingin kau tahu ku selalu milikmu yang mencintaimu spanjang hidupku
6283302 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6283303 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way
6283304 its very clear this panel doesnt like the confederate flag
6283305 that was their starting point in coming to the decision they did the subject matter of the ban is not supposed to be relevant at all in a first amendment analysis
6283306 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
6283307 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
6283308 in that building existed little more than a bunch of
6283309 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
6283310 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
6283311 there was no significant loss of life in those towers
6283312 every part of your body is hurting your stomach is the size of a pea because all the blood rushes to your arms your body is saying stop but your head is saying come on keep going
6283313 the last kilometre felt like 20km every time i looked up the finish seemed no closer
6283314 it was such a hard race and a hard week
6283315 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6283316 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6283317 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
6283318 i never attempt to make money on the stock market i buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years
6283319 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market

6283327 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense
6283328 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american
6283329 they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk

6283332 an agreement in principle has been reached between om and sunderland for the loan of djibril cisse to the english club until the end of the season
6283333 i am just so proud of myself i know i can perform well when i need to i may not have had a good season but this is what i train all year for

6283335 its not luck i worked damn hard for this im just happy its over so i can go to sleep
6283336 the 400m race is very hard its not about the fastest its about keeping it together i just knew i had to fight her usa runner sanya richards from behind i may not be fast but i fight
6283337 unfortunately we have had to abandon the rest of the meeting as the track is waterlogged in places and there is no prospect of it drying out
6283338 it is obviously disappointing both for the connections of the horses and the whole team so i am so sorry about that
6283339 its hugely frustrating and to be beaten by the elements is a very humbling experience
6283340 were determined to carry on with our drainage project to help guard against this in the future
6283341 we have had an unbelievable amount of rainfall and the course could just not take any more
6283342 we had a shower this morning and that has just compounded the situation

6283347 i didnt get on with the manager at stockport so i had to get away
6283348 i lost confidence down there and he wasnt a nice man so i had to get away from the club
6283349 i wasnt enjoying my football to tell the truth i was coming home depressed and the manager didnt help me at all
6283350 dave penneys great for me when the gaffer signed me he said he wanted me to play out wide and that suits me because i like to run at players and get crosses in
6283351 i like to stay out wide get the ball and run at defenders
6283352 moving around is part and parcel of life as a footballer really you just accept it but all the lads have me feel really welcome
6283353 i think its helped us settle having some familiar faces around nobodys got me and adam confused yet i think thats because im better looking than him
6283354 honest and nonjudgmental the film paints both a nuanced and complex portrait of how pleasure and pain commerce and power and liberty and responsibility are intertwined in the most intimate aspects of human relations
6283355 all rhode islanders need to prepare for the possibility of a hurricane
6283356 you will find them move from via to atom over the foreseeable future
6283357 its disappointing but you have to be careful with hamstring injuries and we dont want a repeat of last season when sheki kuqi joined us and suffered a hamstring injury in his first game
6283358 it was so important to get a point at old trafford because it is such a difficult place to play
6283359 they won the last title so for us it is a very good point
6283360 it will give us confidence especially if we win the next match we have to back it up against bolton we need to play well at home next week but sundays point is a great start and hopefully we have shown people how we can play
6283361 here things like virtualization and web services and cloud computing come into play and all of these uses have no problem keeping two four six or more cores busy
6283362 this is the area well likely see dunnington make the most impact
6283363 a better process enables higher transistor counts larger caches and more cores ultimately the cores will impact performance more but the larger caches will help as well
6283364 going from four to six cores will see close to the 50 percent improvement linear scaling with a little slowdown due to i o contention
6283365 along the highway in that stretch of desert somewhere between west texas and east new mexico there was nothing and nothing and nothing and then the thunder lodge but what a nothing there the horizon had a weight she hadnt known a horizon could have a plain unvaried by cactus or tree unstirred by lizard or coyote undimpled by even a shadow only here and there the slightest swell of hills
6283366 here they were a mistranslated family a foreigners half heard version close to the real thing but not quite and like a family blind to the dangers around them to the scorching uninhabited weight of the world
6283367 a perfect simulacrum of the thunder lodge laid out the same way in reverse

6283372 internal documents that were created for internal purposes not intended to be publically sic disclosed nor have they been publically sic disclosed
6283373 the governors latest lackadaisical approach to open government in his administration
6283374 the issue at hand the release of documents outlining the transfer of authority to general bray is moot the governor does not transfer or cede authority when he simply leaves the state and any authority exercised by general bray is in accordance with rhode island general law as head of the states emergency management agency and the rhode island national guard hence there are no responsive documents to the aclus request regarding a transfer of authority during the governors absence as no such transfer will occur

6283381 the school that i want to go to is a state school but its 17 000 a semester
6283382 with the economy the way it is college grads are finding a hard time finding jobs so its best to keep my education costs to a minimum

6283384 games organizers have used designated areas of the city for protests in the past
6283385 shaved his head in a gesture of solidarity with tibetan monks
6283386 weve never viewed these games simply as 16 days of spectacular olympic or
6283387 its a mistake to think that games model themselves on previous games every games ive been to has been very different
6283388 the days of just leaving 90 000 seater stadia particularly in london where youd have two with the are over
6283389 you have to provide something for local communities to do more than simply press their noses up against
6283390 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing
6283391 were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium for which weve been discussing a number of anchor tenancies as well as possibly an educational legacy or even an entertainment legacy
6283392 weve been looking at the legacy from the very moment our teams started looking at the master plans
6283393 real estate is always a good investment if you treat it properly
6283394 newport still represents a good value for the dollar anyone who grew up in new england knows this is the place to be
6283395 i really think a lot of this is self induced
6283396 unfortunately when youre being cautious it trickles down and being cautious means someone doesnt have a job
6283397 in the morning its nice just to have a cup of coffee out there
6283398 and in the evening its nice to sit out there and just see young families pushing their strollers and enjoying the evening after dinner
6283399 not being secluded here and being able to see everyone from newport enjoying what were enjoying here
6283400 too many designers you see it and you know it and its something somebody else couldve done almost anywhere but i think carol brought a signature to this place that really its different it looks more like an individual did it for themselves
6283401 he was a ham radio operator for the base in gitmo
6283402 i want something kinda wowy and preferably kinda huntery but also somewhat personal
6283403 i found it easy to move to the north east
6283404 i was reluctant at one point and i didnt want to but you have to be a man and make hard decisions and its been the best decision i have made looking back i would not have changed it for the world
6283405 you have to decide to run away from the big lights if southern based players can get away from that and overcome the difficulties of leaving your family then they will find out that its a great place to live
6283406 anton is a good defender and he is his own man in his own right everyone knows what he is capable of and he was a regular for long enough at west ham
6283407 i think sunderland challenging for europe is a realistic goal
6283408 thats the main goal we have the earlier the better because once you are able to maintain that sort of status it helps to attract better players we are building and we are determined to finish in a higher spot than last seasons 15th

6283413 i think through our courage we got this far but we were limited by our capabilities
6283414 i think that what you have seen is my facial expression on the court
6283415 this is my job the olympics are not only about the game they are about friendship about exchanging pins making friends at the opening ceremony
6283416 you will end up at the lower end of the scale with unintended people ending up in prison in minor circumstances
6283417 what we want to do is remove those soft options from the judiciary when it comes to sentencing of police officers
6283418 i think the attorney general has said something because people are going to be demanding that something be said but simply removing suspended terms of imprisonment as an option is a terribly soft response
6283419 an income tax would place the burden on other people and is a viable option
6283420 if voters approve the income tax it will take a while to come into the district as it is paid on a quarterly basis
6283421 if the income tax is rejected the board ultimately will have to look at additional cuts we have to stop the bleeding or by 2010 the district will be broke

6283427 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
6283428 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
6283429 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
6283430 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
6283431 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
6283432 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
6283433 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
6283434 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
6283435 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6283436 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6283437 so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6283438 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6283439 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states

6283442 you like it because theres a bunch of sugar in it
6283443 if you help a man you help an individual if you help a woman you help a whole family
6283444 ive put my heart in this and im absolutely thrilled with how the women have progressed and how the center has grown and with how many women theyve been able to reach out and help
6283445 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6283446 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6283447 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6283448 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6283449 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6283450 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6283451 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6283452 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6283453 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6283454 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6283455 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6283456 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6283457 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6283458 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6283459 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6283460 i was amused to read davids comments that he would rather his side suffered relegation every other season than be like middlesbrough
6283461 david is a good friend but i can only assume relegation has affected his thinking a little i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories
6283462 since moving to the riverside in 1995 we have achieved five major cup finals are the only english side outside of the so called big four to have played in a european final have enjoyed successive seasons of uefa cup football won our first major trophy and enjoyed 11 consecutive years in the premier league
6283463 in the meantime birmingham have managed a couple of relegations and a lengthy spell in what is now the championship somehow i dont believe even their own supporters would agree their highs and lows have been preferable to ours
6283464 some people might not like relegation promotion relegation promotion but would you want to be a middlesbrough stuck in mid table every season
6283465 some people would settle for that because it is better for your heart but the highs and lows are what football is all about for me
6283466 sorry man you were charged the correct price the sign is wrong
6283467 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6283468 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything

6283472 the united states of poetry a day in the life
6283473 were a giant step closer to achieving justice for the balazs family and in general
6283474 i can only hope it will be resolved as soon as possible
6283475 but ever since hungary submitted his extradition request he and his family have done everything possible to prevent that from happening
6283476 i mean all these claims that he wont get a fair trial i mean this is really rubbish this is pure fantasy these are merely lame excuses by people who are desperate to stop the legal process
6283477 i think its very important that people remember and look at zentai and think of the young person who is accused of committing a terrible crime the most terrible crime
6283478 to think of peter balazs whose life was horribly ended just because he was a jew at the age of 18
6283479 he had a bright future and a loving family and his life was brutally ended and his body was thrown into the danube with not even a grave to go to
6283480 australias one of the worlds great democracies and has a stirling record in many spheres but unfortunately in this area the record has not been good
6283481 these are merely lame excuses by people who are desperate to stop the legal process
6283482 it was the american colonels even more than the generals who were asking for more troops
6283483 we believe in why we are fighting here and we want to finish this fight we know we can win it

6283491 ive certainly done my share of street performing and ive seen street performers at festivals all over the world
6283492 i knew downtown lawrence had the capability to support a festival
6283493 were paying artists a stipend and were feeding them so no ones going to lose money by coming to this festival but if they make money thats entirely up to them thats the way street performing is its a matter of survival and it makes better shows if you ask me

6283498 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature

6283505 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6283506 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6283507 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6283508 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6283509 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6283510 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6283511 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6283512 this is veep week that in reality is about all that anyone outside senator barack obamas inner inner circle knows

6283516 the descriptions are very similar the clothing description in one is similar to one from the houston store and we have reason to believe its the same person
6283517 hes instructed people to stay in the store and not follow him out so therefore no one has gone to look out of fear

6283542 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
6283543 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
6283544 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
6283545 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
6283546 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
6283547 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
6283548 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
6283549 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
6283550 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
6283551 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
6283552 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
6283553 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
6283554 for instance the term knuckle down you have to keep at least one knuckle down when youre shooting a marble otherwise its cheating or fudging which is another marble term
6283555 of course my parents had told me to knuckle down my whole life but i didnt really think about where that expression had come from
6283556 ive taught them to play marbles and they participated in last years tournament
6283557 and now when they come to my house they say can we play marbles its been really exciting to me that ive turned them on to that
6283558 for me especially working at the museum and then talking to people its been a bridge between generations
6283559 when im up in the marble gallery and giving a tour the grandparents are like oh i played this and all of a sudden the kids are like you were a kid you played this
6283560 i dont think we realize sometimes how much as a culture weve changed when you played marbles originally you drew a circle in the dirt well now theres so much pavement that kind of contributed to the decline of marble playing and now theres tv and video games weve gotten so very virtual and marbles is an actual hands on thing that you can do
6283561 in our case well be using hula hoops on the gymnasium floor the person who gets the most marbles to touch the inner edge of a hula hoop will win that game
6283562 someone taught me this trick where you lay your hand on the ground and you point your thumb at the marble that youre trying to shoot at
6283563 then you curl up your shooter marble in your index finger and then curl up your knuckles and then you shoot with your thumb toward that marble so youre sort of aiming or getting it in your sights

6283573 the climate crisis is significantly worse and unfolding more rapidly than those on the pessimistic side of the ipcc projections had warned us
6283574 a lot of my friends talk to me about these issues but not a lot of people do something about it
6283575 i think its really important for young people to get involved
6283576 thats the key here you have to have a comprehensive plan that looks at everything so we become less dependent on foreign oil
6283577 we get nothing out of the plan to drill offshore

6283586 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6283587 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6283588 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6283589 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6283590 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6283591 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6283592 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off

6283613 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6283614 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away

6283637 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6283638 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6283639 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6283640 in fact two weeks ago i called a meeting with my 30 staff members and told them i dont think we can do the event this year
6283641 were still paying outstanding debts from the 2005 event and the attendance last year was very bad although we were affected by 100 degree heat one weekend and rainstorms on another nevertheless i made the decision to go for it and take our chances
6283642 weve had to downsize significantly and well be operating on a shoestring budget of 45 000
6283643 people underestimate what it takes to put on these events and even though were a nonprofit organization we still have to pay all the fees involved for instance if we were to try and put this event on from scratch it would cost us 1 2 million
6283644 major sponsors like exxon and washington mutual bank are just not helping us this year
6283645 but weve no time to ponder weve just got to get on with it
6283646 were appealing to the people who make our event possible the audience
6283647 we can break even with 25 000 people this year but 100 000 people would be sublime and put us back in business
6283648 we wont be competing with all the other festivals around this time thereby separating ourselves from the crowd
6283649 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6283650 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination

6283652 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6283653 to make every vote in every state politically relevant and equal in presidential elections support the national popular vote bill
6283654 it is amazing to me that the people of this area do not see the value of the electoral college
6283655 i have to agree with wsugrad2005 the electoral college was set in place to stop the
6283656 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6283657 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6283658 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6283659 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6283660 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6283661 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6283662 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6283663 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6283664 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6283665 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6283666 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6283667 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6283668 obama campaign officials never bought the argument that clinton was the second choice of edwards voters immediately after edwards dropped out of the race at the end of january obama won 11 straight contests in a row
6283669 you have to wait for the september issue of crack to come out in three days
6283670 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
6283671 clinton exploded demanding to know why the campaign wasnt on the attack solis doyle was put on a plane to iowa the next day to oversee the closing weeks within hours of the call the panicked staff produced a blistering attack on obama for what it characterized as evidence of his overweening lust for power he had written a kindergarten essay titled i want to become president the campaign was mocked for weeks
6283672 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
6283673 a place in ghana where its difficult to send and receive e mail
6283674 praying for a deluge to drown out barack obama at the democratic national convention in two weeks time
6283675 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
6283676 no one has been found guilty of anything lets not trash the constitution
6283677 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely antiwar ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul

6283681 california coastal cleanup day is the states premier volunteer event

6283683 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6283684 if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6283685 from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades
6283686 senator lieberman can speak to whatever group he wants but its not going to change the fact that john mccain is a flawed candidate who is wrong on every issue facing the country
6283687 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6283688 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6283689 if you want to find out which companies are going to change the world look at the inc 500
6283690 these are the most innovative dynamic fast growing companies in the nation the ones coming up with solutions to some of our knottiest problems creating systems that let us conduct business faster and easier and manufacturing products we soon discover we cant live without the inc 500 list is inc magazines tribute to american business ingenuity and ambition
6283691 to be recognized by inc is an honor as well as a statement of validation for what we set out to achieve
6283692 and to be recognized as the 18th fastest growing real estate related company during the greatest market upheaval since the great depression is further confirmation that were being embraced by the market
6283693 if we wait for federal action from our congressional leaders it will be too late we must take immediate and aggressive action to halt climate change
6283694 mark mccuen indicated to me a few times that mick was very slow at producing the money
6283695 so at that time i came back to talk to mick about it
6283696 i had received an order for 19 000 to be returned to the prosecutors office
6283697 i simply asked mick to get the 19 000 and he couldnt do it
6283698 sometimes when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all theyve got and win just one for the gipper
6283699 have dropped plans to top the holding cells in place for use during next weeks democratic convention with razor wire after some groups started comparing the site to the detention facility for suspected terrorists at guantanamo bay cuba
6283700 where some people were held for days at a converted bus depot
6283701 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6283702 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6283703 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6283704 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
6283705 his preference yes would be to see his son serve

6283713 is being touted by the media as a man of principle yet he was involved with other women while married to his first wife and was implicated in the so called keating scandal with four other senators he was eventually reprimanded by the congress for the appearance of impropriety the senator reportedly has a violent temper and can be extremely confrontational and profane when angry these red flags about senator mccains character are reminiscent of the man who now occupies the white house
6283714 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6283715 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6283716 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6283717 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6283718 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6283719 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6283720 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6283721 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6283722 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6283723 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6283724 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6283725 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6283726 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6283727 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6283728 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6283729 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6283730 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6283731 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6283732 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6283733 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6283734 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6283735 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6283736 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6283737 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6283738 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6283739 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6283740 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6283741 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6283742 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6283743 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6283744 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6283745 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6283746 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6283747 if its science fiction if its popular cancel it put in a reality show and more wraslin
6283748 i am innocent and have been falsely accused i was only appealing to the family on the street to try and help my daughter
6283749 he did a very foolish thing which is not to be condoned and paid a heavy price but i think we have to look at the whole person and this a tragedy for the community hes been a ubiquitous presence and it wont be easy to replace him
6283750 i thought to myself who is this guy raising his voice like that over the years weve had our policy differences but ive always been struck by his passion
6283751 he was a pioneer and gave the black community a voice
6283752 hes made some ill advised decisions but im not going to indict him in any negative way i think were all trying to do a difficult job representing the voiceless who are crying out in frustration
6283753 we have a once in a generation chance to bring meaningful and lasting change to our country by electing barack obama president and sending a stronger democratic majority to the senate
6283754 we need a stronger majority in the senate to enact obamas broad sweeping agenda and our outstanding group of candidates is ready to deliver it
6283755 for too long families in new hampshire and across the country have struggled as washington has put the needs of special interests ahead of the needs of middle class families well it is time for a change
6283756 this november we are going to take our country in a new direction by standing up and fighting for the middle class again if we want a new direction in washington we need real change this fall
6283757 as a proud westerner and candidate for united states senate it is my honor to take part in this historic convention for change
6283758 in my home state of new mexico and around the nation its clear that voters will have a choice between leaders who will fight for our middle class and do whats right no matter what or those who choose to stand for the same failed policies of the past
6283759 i am honored to have the opportunity to address the democratic convention and speak to my vision to partner with senator obama and make washington work for working families again
6283760 oregonians are ready for the kind of change senator obama will bring to washington george bushs economy has been a disaster for oregon workers and families
6283761 next weeks convention will be a tremendous opportunity to talk about how we can change the direction of maine and our nation
6283762 i look forward to speaking to my fellow delegates about solving the energy crisis bringing our troops home safely and responsibly from iraq providing universal health care and expanding opportunities for the middle class
6283763 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
6283764 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
6283765 if a substantial majority had agreed to do so hed have done the same
6283766 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6283767 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6283768 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6283769 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6283770 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6283771 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon

6283782 while we are disappointed that nasa terminated our contract we believe in their process and support their decision we are pleased the gao has dismissed the protest we look forward to submitting a limited final proposal revision as required by nasa and to a timely contract award
6283783 we remain confident our offering will continue to be judged as the best value to the government our world class and highly experienced contractor team offered an innovative and comprehensive solution to develop and produce the next spacesuit for nasa we remain fully committed and prepared to meet all requirements of the constellation spacesuit program
6283784 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6283785 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now

6283787 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children

6283789 and it came through the trees right there the palm trees twelve landed here because it didnt touch the stone wall it landed here probably bounced here hit our drainage thing here and then again hit it probably hit against this tree where it stopped
6283790 maybe about 500 pounds but still when its a flying missile you know it is probably more than that were just fortunate that nothing else was damaged
6283791 we are so protected on both sides both times to have not sustain any major damage
6283792 things will happen i think were more concerned about other things coming down but if its going to happen its going to happen i think
6283793 so it happened sometime on friday probably til yesterday i noticed the fencing was broken it looked like something had happened so probably sometime between thursday and the 18th
6283794 like its name which means to come out of the earth hu honua turns to the land to effectively and sustainably meet hawaiis power needs
6283795 projects like the hu honua bioenergy facility play an important role in shifting hawaiis energy mix away from imported petroleum toward renewable sources our partners at mma renewable ventures bring to the project the management and operational expertise needed to ensure that hu honua continues delivering reliable clean energy for decades to come
6283796 by its very nature renewable energy can deliver benefits that are not only local but also global by reducing pollutants that contribute to global warming as project partner on hu honua we are collaborating with many stakeholders to ensure this project benefits the community the economy and the environment
6283797 we are proud to be entering the bioenergy market with this investment in hawaiis clean energy future
6283798 there is no longer this widespread belief among the wise guys and gals of both parties that were all just sitting around waiting for this race to break in obamas direction the polls as well as the money race suggest otherwise
6283799 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6283800 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6283801 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6283802 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6283803 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6283804 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6283805 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6283806 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6283807 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6283808 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6283809 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6283810 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6283811 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6283812 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6283813 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6283814 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6283815 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6283816 if only this picture had been published before the 2000 election gore would be president
6283817 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6283818 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6283819 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6283820 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6283821 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6283822 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6283823 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6283824 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6283825 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6283826 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6283827 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6283828 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6283829 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6283830 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6283831 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6283832 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6283833 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6283834 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6283835 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6283836 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6283837 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6283838 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6283839 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6283840 wir haben nicht das gef hl dass wir ein hurra anstimmen k nnen nur weil wir durchgehalten haben

6283843 someone wrote a little piece of adobe flash code to copy text to the clipboard then they put it in a loop to do it once a second then they put it in an innocent looking flash based banner ad with their harmful url as the payload then they signed up for some advertising networks and submitted their bad ad presumably paying considerable money to get it featured on sites that you and i visit regularly such as msnbc and digg and when someone has this ad loaded they can copy all they want but everything they paste will be just that url so if you are writing an e mail to aunt millie telling her to look at your ebay auction located at paste or to download picasa to organize her photos download here paste shes going to get the virus when she visits the bad site
6283844 and we were trying different things and we were smoking funny things
6283845 at this terrible moment we manifest our feelings of solidarity and brotherhood to the relatives and close friends of the victims of such a regrettable accident
6283846 i transmit my deepest condolence and my sympathy to the families of the victims to the spanish people and government
6283847 in this moment of great pain i want to present to your majesty in the name of the portuguese people and myself our deepest condolences and sympathies
6283848 we are proud to offer our customers in orange the same high quality food at exceptional prices that have become a hit all across southern california nevada and arizona
6283849 we look forward to opening even more stores and bringing even more good paying jobs to the orange county area
6283850 we knew that once we had the opportunity to present our facts in this case we would prove mr mangans complete innocence
6283851 weve proven that the secs accusations against john on both the insider trading and section 5 were completely and unequivocally wrong
6283852 i fought this case because i knew that i did nothing wrong
6283853 i could not allow the sec to derail my career over unfounded accusations this ordeal has been extremely difficult for me my entire family and my former colleagues and employees i am proud to have my name and integrity vindicated and am eager to move on with my life
6283854 we are greatly saddened about the passing of congresswoman tubbs jones
6283855 this is a great loss for our party and our nation on behalf of the democratic party we extend our thoughts and prayers to congresswoman tubbs jones friends and family during this difficult time
6283856 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
6283857 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
6283858 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
6283859 despite a generally tough operating environment we are pleased to have achieved a profit for the year
6283860 importantly we are in a strong financial position with cash on hand of 8 8 million at year end which gives us the balance sheet strength to pursue our growth objectives
6283861 we have achieved several important strategic goals during the year including our expansion into the alternative fuels business through the acquisition of sydney based orbital gas products
6283862 these growth initiatives will add value in future years and position the company extremely well in the current environment
6283863 the acquisition of ogp marks the first phase of our plans to grow into gaseous fuel technology and develop additional commercial business opportunities
6283864 these and other developments in the liquid natural gas lng market provide exciting new growth avenues for orbital in the current market environment where demand for alternative fuels technology is rapidly increasing
6283865 we are focusing on implementing our strategic investment initiatives and targeting continued profitability year on year
6283866 we are laying the foundations to ensure that synerject is well positioned to win sales when chinese emissions legislation is introduced
6283867 with the increasing awareness of global warming rising fuel costs and depleting availability of crude oil the call for alternative fuels and energy and emission management has never been stronger
6283868 orbitals engineering services are well positioned to provide key technology services in forthcoming years
6283869 licensing and royalty revenue increased by 17 to 2 7 million compared to the previous financial year despite the steady royalty volumes the contribution from this sector fell by 0 3 million due to the impact of the weakening us dollar but this was offset by increased licence fees
6283870 since product introduction in 1996 over 1 6 million air injectors cylinders have been commercially sold reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving fuel economy
6283871 orbitals commitment to identify and secure alternative fuel opportunities and continued expansion into aligned businesses will ensure that the company continues to grow as a profitable international developer of innovative technical solutions for a cleaner world
6283872 we have unveiled a number of new initiatives aimed at furthering the companys expansion into the alternative fuels business including the formation of orbital gas products formally boral alternative fuel systems a tier 1 supplier of lpg systems to the ford motor corporation and to the aftermarket operators
6283873 in addition our growth in this area received a further boost with the federal government announcing funding for the installation at our facilities in perth of a heavy duty engine testing facility capable of operating engines on natural gas lpg and biodiesel as well as diesel and gasoline
6283874 hilft nicht die stadt mit einer f rderung k nnen wir nicht weitermachen wieder einmal bekommen wir privaten den schwarzen peter zugeschoben
6283875 wir betreuen 75 kinder haben vor zwei jahren neu gebaut und jetzt das
6283876 its only been a few months since i learned about the condition and i really havent formulated any sort of plan on what im going to do but i do know i want to educate other athletes and the importance of getting checked out
6283877 tampa bay co owner oren koules called and told me i worked too hard in my life to not get drafted and he just said to worry about staying healthy
6283878 he told me he drafted me more for the person i am
6283879 hell be a student assistant coach a position that is still evolving here at the university
6283880 hell have sessions with fellow student athletes during and after practices and on occasion attend coaches meetings and plan and coordinate practices i will not put him in a position to critique fellow players but i do want him to listen in and learn the process and maybe a few years down the road hell be able to offer opinion
6283881 ive seen situations where during an athletes tenure at the school he was injured and sidelined and we still honored the scholarship but this marks the first time i can recall when a young man was forced to retire before the start of his freshman year
6283882 there was never any question about us honoring his scholarship this is something we all know david could handle since he has that type of personality and courage
6283883 i think over the last three years the transformation he had made in his game was unbelievable
6283884 once he figured out what it took to improve his game he really began dedicating so much time to it he worked out with me every day went on a good nutritional program and turned himself into an elite athlete thats why having everything come to an end was so unfair
6283885 its great knowing that he will be using his time to educate others about hcm since not too many people know about it
6283886 if you can catch it early enough perhaps itll make a difference as it did with dave
6283887 he worked out with me every day went on a good nutritional program and turned himself into an elite athlete thats why having everything come to an end was so unfair
6283888 i first saw david play five years ago when he was a sophomore at shattuck st marys
6283889 the thing that popped out in my mind and what i marveled at was that fact that if you didnt know it was david carle on the ice his skating style and movements were so very close to his older brother he matured and progressed so well
6283890 theres a 50 percent chance of inheriting the condition genetically but since no other person in my family suffers from it after being checked it appears its not genetic in my case
6283891 basically this is a thickening of the heart wall in the apex where the chambers meet that limits the volume of blood my heart can pump and hold
6283892 the symptoms are overlapping from other things and are fairly minor and oftentimes the first symptom you show is your last its very hard to detect so you need to be proactive about it
6283893 i think its great hes willing to come out and want to help others who might have this malady but who arent aware of it
6283894 if his message could help someone else then thats the greatest gift
6283895 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6283896 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6283897 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6283898 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6283899 we understand that theres an impact that ripples throughout our economy when oil prices go up
6283900 it affects the price of transportation airline tickets shipping and electricity
6283901 we are interested to know electricity the surcharge stays high when prices are dropping
6283902 our customers can expect to see lower electric bills this fall thanks to the decrease in crude oil prices
6283903 we do maintain a 1 month inventory of fuel on the island so that is going to build in some lag there
6283904 it tends to make any increases or decreases more gradual over time
6283905 our rate increase is so we can make necessary improvements to the electric system
6283906 we have to maintain the grid to continue providing reliable service were also recovering the cost of making some improvements to add renewable energy to our system
6283907 itd go down and then itd go back there was just a particle in there that kept catching
6283908 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6283909 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6283910 love god with all your heart mind soul and strength
6283911 bush administration lawyers could be nailed for their role in destroying evidence in the cia scandal thanks to a quiet connecticut child porn case
6283912 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6283913 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6283914 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
6283915 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
6283916 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6283917 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6283918 the bush administration is laying out a new secrecy defense in an effort to end a court battle about the white house visits of now imprisoned lobbyist jack abramoff
6283919 secrecy invoked on abramoff lawsuits administration employs new secrecy defense in lawsuits over abramoffs white house visits
6283920 the senates retreat from its initial demand that now attorney general michael mukasey denounce waterboarding is detrimental to the countrys moral fabric for the first time torture bears an imprimatur of democratic approval
6283921 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6283922 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6283923 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6283924 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6283925 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6283926 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6283927 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6283928 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6283929 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6283930 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6283931 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6283932 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6283933 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6283934 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6283935 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6283936 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6283937 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6283938 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6283939 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6283940 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6283941 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6283942 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6283943 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6283944 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6283945 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6283946 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6283947 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6283948 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6283949 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6283950 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6283951 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6283952 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6283953 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6283954 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6283955 quiero la medalla pero estar satisfecho si rindo al m ximo

6283959 washington afp a former white house press secretary has accused president george w bush of misleading the public over a cia leak which blew the cover of one of their spies
6283960 the most powerful leader in the world had called upon me to speak on his behalf and help restore credibility he lost amid the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq
6283961 so i stood at the white house briefing room podium in front of the glare of the klieg lights for the better part of two weeks and publicly exonerated two of the senior most aides in the white house karl rove and scooter libby
6283962 target specific structures such as cancer cells when injected into patients
6283963 but she made it very clear shes really not counting on it and she was urging all of her supporters to get beyond the speculation
6283964 it would be such a shocker at this point because so many people have written it off
6283965 im not saying its what he would do but if he has quietly kept her in the mix it would have a powerful effect to kind of come out of the blue
6283966 people dont necessarily have access to their e mail from where they log in
6283967 the united kingdom has one of the toughest borders in the world and we are determined to ensure it stays that way
6283968 these checks make up just one part of britains triple ring of security alongside fingerprint visas for three quarters of the worlds population and the roll out of id cards for foreign nationals locking people to one identity
6283969 a record check for the above attorney has revealed no public discipline
6283970 t he virginia state bar is a state agency that protects the public by educating and assisting lawyers to practice ethically and competently and by disciplining those who violate the supreme courts rules of professional conduct all at no cost to virginia taxpayers
6283971 that the circumstances are such that the belief is reasonable
6283972 a lawyer of reasonable prudence and competence would ascertain the matter in question
6283973 i believe that elston was offering me a quid pro quo agreement my silence in exchange for the attorney generals
6283974 he also got a phone call from a clearly nervous elston asking if he intended to go public he was offering me a deal you stay silent and the attorney general wont say anything bad about you
6283975 theyre the justice department entitled to make these changes for any reason or no reason or even for an idiotic reason but if they are trying to suggest that people have inferior performance to hide whatever their true agenda is that is wrong they should retract those statements
6283976 he reacted quite a bit to the idea of anyone voluntarily testifying and it seemed clear that they would see that as a major escalation of the conflict meriting some kind of unspecified form of retaliation
6283977 he was offering me a deal you stay silent and the attorney general wont say anything bad about you
6283978 the attorney general was not going to disclose that i or the other u
6283979 a reasonable person would have felt both offended and threatened
6283980 if you remain silent we will not out you as someone who was forced to resign
6283981 i believe that elston was offering me a quid pro quo agreement my silence in exchange for the attorney generals
6283982 justice officials feel like they are taking unnecessary flak to avoid trashing each of us
6283983 i also made it a point to tell him that all of us have turned down multiple invitations to testify he reacted quite a bit to the idea of anyone voluntarily testifying and it seemed clear that they would see this as a major escalation of the conflict meriting some kind of unspecified form of retaliation
6283984 cummins wanted to send a message to all of us we got that message loud and clear if you talk to the press or go to congress the department of justice will not consider you a friend i considered it an act of intimidation
6283985 mr cummins let me ask you first id like to ask you to put your u s attorney hat back on
6283986 youre still in office and think of a significant grand jury investigation that you led as united states attorney in your district and consider that a significant witness in that grand jury investigation has just come into your office to relate to you that prior to his grand jury testimony he was approached about his testimony and told essentially exactly the words that mr elston approached you what would your next step be as united states attorney
6283987 we take intimidation of witnesses very seriously in the department of justice and the u s attorneys office so we would be very proactive in that situation
6283988 i would qualify that by saying that at the time this discussion was had we werent under a subpoena the idea of testifying was just kind of a theoretical idea out there and i would say to the extent we talked about testimony at all it was the idea that running out and volunteering to be part of this would not be viewed charitably by the people that it would affect
6283989 but if that sort of approach had been made to a witness in an active proceeding that you were leading and you were extremely proactive about it that would lead you where
6283990 well wed certainly investigate it and see if a crime had occurred
6283991 obstruction of justice i think there are several statutes that might be implicated but obstruction of justice
6283992 i would be discussing it with the assigned prosecutor and federal agents
6283993 same answer sir i would contact the career assistant u s attorney and probably the fbi and talk about whats the evidence we have to maybe move forward on an obstruction investigation
6283994 i believe that elston was offering me a quid pro quo agreement my silence in exchange for the attorney generals
6283995 during one phone call michael elston erroneously accused me of leaking my dismissal to the press and criticized me for talking to other dismissed u s attorneys
6283996 buy my silence by promising that the attorney general would not demean me in his senate testimony
6283997 reflect that i believed mr elstons tone was sinister and that he was prepared to threaten me further if he concluded i did not intend to continue to remain silent about my dismissal
6283998 a quid pro quo agreement my silence in exchange for the attorney generals
6283999 and criticized me for talking to other dismissed u s attorneys
6284000 stand up for the law with respect to sentencing and department policy
6284001 theres not much i can do apart from recommending you because there are legal constraints on career hiring to ensure that its not political
6284002 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
6284003 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
6284004 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
6284005 hey you old ladies are adorable and i want to post your photos on the internet kay
6284006 are you trying to take a photo of yourself with the mountains in the background
6284007 i can take a picture of you if you want
6284008 my husband wants me to research neighborhoods in the area
6284009 are you just taking pictures of crazy old ladies on bikes
6284010 hey baby you wanna go back in the alley and have some fun with me
6284011 listen woman i have plenty of fucking money but theres no way im giving it to a train wreck of an old whore like you
6284012 i dont want to bother you but can i tell you that i was once on quite the same path that you find yourself on now i see the skeptical look in youre eye but i assure you i tell the truth i was well on my way to a life of good citizenry but as you can tell i lost my way somehow now i am but a shell of my former self much like my only remaining friend this fading metropolis whose streets i call home would you be so kind as to throw a few coins my way so that i might buy myself something to drink while i eat the few scraps of food i was lucky enough to salvage from the dumpster over there
6284013 im sure that as you were being raised you were warned against judging others based on appearances many times
6284014 come on gimme some motherfucking money so i can get some food
6284015 then dont worry about what im doing out here are you gonna let me suck your dick or not
6284016 excuse me but perhaps you could help me out you see im new to this as this is the first time i have ever willingly attended a church service of any kind forgive me for judging on appearances but i would guess that you are a seasoned veteran though i am not personally experienced with how this thing works i take a certain amount of pride in the fact that i have educated myself on matters of the world that do not necessarily pertain to my everyday life such as the inner workings of the christian faith among the other major religions of the world now if you allow me i will tell you what i have ascertained through my study of your religion
6284017 from what i know i take this book this bible into my hands and rub it three times once i have done this jesus christ will appear and grant me three wishes this will of course make me a happy man which in turn will improve the condition of the world because as im certain you will agree the more happy people there are in the world the better the world is as a whole this i believe is the power that christianity has to change the world pleas tell me if you believe i am mistaken
6284018 where the hell are you the game has already started youre supposed to be here
6284019 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6284020 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6284021 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6284022 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6284023 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6284024 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6284025 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6284026 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6284027 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6284028 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6284029 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6284030 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6284031 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6284032 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6284033 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
6284034 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
6284035 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
6284036 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
6284037 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
6284038 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
6284039 many in the christian right tend to get their information
6284040 is a show on fox that tests how smart adults are compared to a group of 5th graders but mind you the kids are no ordinary students when they grow up some of them want to be scientists inventors accountants marine biologist child prodigies and geniuses uh oh
6284041 i believe cnet management let jeff go for all the wrong reasons i believe cnet intends to soften the sites tone and push for higher scores to make advertisers happy
6284042 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
6284043 at least we dont have to worry about someone taking him
6284044 i just think he needs to play and hes shown he can play
6284045 he had a good game last week and needs some more
6284046 that is like saying all borrowers should go to banks and not deal with brokers
6284047 but i cant do it she wont listen to me she sees me as a junior someone she can control she wont take kindly to me bossing her around giving her lessons and such
6284048 what were they thinking they should find someone else to do this yossys like an alpha wolf she expects everyone to do what she says especially the younger ones remember how she treated nigaki as her own personal servant theres no way someone like you can control her
6284049 they act like just because im in school ive got lots of free time or something let me tell you im not looking forward to baby sitting everyones favorite lovable baka not only will i have to deal with yossy but i also have to worry about all the girls that adore her they will undoubtedly get mad if i do anything that would upset or insult their precious class clown
6284050 and her wit is clever and genuinely funny i dont think you could classify that as class clown shes so much more then that
6284051 well makoto its been great talking to you i feel soo much better now but i guess im just going to go and
6284052 im sorry listen konkon i believe in you really i think youre the type that can handle anything if you put your mind to it and you can call me anytime you want ill be here to help you if you need it
6284053 thanks mako im probably going to need all the help i can get
6284054 you dont have to worry ive got this all figured out
6284055 yup but not for long listen konkon i was thinking about this all night i really dont care for any kinda tutoring or whatever but i figure the only way out of this is to actually do the work so thats why i brought this paper with me is it enough the schedule you gave me said the first lesson would be math right
6284056 um yes that should be more then enough so do you want to get started
6284057 absolutely im playing tennis with rika in a little bit and i dont want to be late
6284058 i like the confidence yoshizawa san but youre probably going to be late there are like a hundred problems and theyre pretty difficult
6284059 um i think you misunderstood im not going to do them you are
6284060 look its easy you write the answers on this page and then when i come back ill copy the answers onto this other page and turn it in and tadaa the work is done and meanwhile i was able to stare at rikas hot bod in her skimpy tennis outfit see great idea right
6284061 you see doesnt this sight make you proud shes only got a little bit of spare time and she uses it to help us out now thats what i call dedication
6284062 well lets just say the work will be turned in on time
6284063 thats great news for some reason i was worried that she wouldnt cooperate
6284064 hey konkon whats up how did it go with yocchan
6284065 aaah yeah i figured something like that would happen whatd she do
6284066 hm so did you actually do it the work did you finish it
6284067 yes but i didnt have a choice she just walked out without even asking me how i felt about it at all
6284068 you did have a choice the choice of not doing it and letting her roast for not staying
6284069 no i couldnt do something like that shes still my friend even if she can be infuriating
6284070 im starting to think i should ask someone else for help someone whos just a little less in love with her then you are
6284071 sorry konkon but you know how much i like her
6284072 i know thats the problem anyways what was your point in all of that drabble just now
6284073 my point is that youre gonna have to do what not too many other people will dare heh youll have to stand up to her
6284074 yeah dont let her get away with mistreating you show her whos the boss if she wont do the work then make her everyone thinks youre just this simple little timid mouse but truthfully there is a lot more strength in you then people give you credit for you can do this konkon dont back down and tell her whats what
6284075 i will thanks mako tomorrow shell do the lesson for sure
6284076 and her wit is clever and genuinely funny i dont think you could classify that as class clown shes so much more then that
6284077 you did have a choice the choice of not doing it and letting her roast for not staying
6284078 no i couldnt do something like that shes still my friend even if she can be infuriating
6284079 i can re yokozano a yossy konno story ch 1 in which an impossible task is given
6284080 and her wit is clever and genuinely funny i dont think you could classify that as class clown shes so much more then that
6284081 if i study real hard i may just have the smarts of a chimpanzee what do you think teach
6284082 well going by these answers i think youre setting your goal a bit too high maybe the smarts of a small lab rat but look on the bright side at least you did well in the math
6284083 not really i mean the extension to my tutoring lessons kinda sucks but
6284084 hey im man enough to admit when ive been pwned i guess this means youre gonna stop giving me the answers huh
6284085 nope it just means that youre going to have to actually check every answer to make sure its correct
6284086 gee if thats the case i might as well just sit down and do the work myself
6284087 yeah i admit you got me good but i still have no intentions of wasting my precious time in any of these books although i must say your cool points through the roof girl seriously i didnt think you had it in you im totally impressed
6284088 you cant be serious just do the lessons yossy its just for two hours in the afternoons surely you can spare that much time out of your schedule and get the worksheets done look at me even with my schooling i was able to squeeze the tutoring in
6284089 im not like you kon kon i have a life
6284090 some of us happen to think that there is more to living then just chasing skirts and adding notches to ones belt
6284091 yeah right only people whove never had a notch feel that way buuut i wouldnt expect a cold fish like you to understand that
6284092 if youre not a cold fish this little task will be no problem for you
6284093 uh s studying we should be studying we should get to work
6284094 kiss me and ill do the work willingly for the rest of our sessions
6284095 i am not and besides who cares we should be studying not talking about kisses and cold fish which im not by the way

6284102 why couldnt i have been the tutor im not a cold fish that kiss shouldve been mine noooo
6284103 just because i want a romantic kiss with someone i love doesnt make me a cold fish i dont do that with just anybody
6284104 who wouldnt kiss yossy if she gives them permission a cold fish thats who
6284105 im not gay did you ever think about that why would i want to kiss another girl
6284106 it doesnt matter i dont see her like that i like boys i want to date boys and when i kiss i want it to be a boy
6284107 you didnt kiss yossy when her lips were like right there all this time i never knew my best friend was a cold fish
6284108 im not a you know what i give up you and yossy can think whatever you want just as long as she does the lessons and doesnt give me any more trouble
6284109 i dont think so mako chan theres no way she can get out of the tutoring now their on to her
6284110 sorry if i startled everyone but i thought that since were all here we could do a little um bonding exercise
6284111 you mean bond over learning about the history of japan heh no thanks
6284112 no really i want to play a fun little telephone game
6284113 this game is easy and fun well do it in a half table round to see if everyone likes it ill start it and ill whisper something into risas ear whos sitting to my left then shell repeat it to koharu and koharu to sayumi till we finally get to yossy and as the last person yossy must stand and repeat the phrase when it gets to her no matter what it is and then ill tell you guys if the phrase is right or not want to play
6284114 and if we really like the game we might start doing it around the whole table instead of just half
6284115 uh that is i just want to start it like this first
6284116 should i really repeat this maybe i miss heard konno can you repeat what you said
6284117 no you have to say whatever it is you think i said you dont get a chance to rehear it and that goes for everyone
6284118 wont you tell the rest of us what the statement is
6284119 come on yoshizawa san theyre just words its not like it means anything
6284120 uhn just say what it is we wont think any differently of you
6284121 yoshizawa san is a spoilt small minded pervert who has no manners and wears boy underwear with fish net stockings and high heels
6284122 no its not what you told me was much different i think koharu screwed it up
6284123 doesnt matter now for the other side starting with ai chan and ending with yoshizawa san
6284124 why dont we start from me this time and end it with you
6284125 okay we can start with you but well do one full circle and end with sayumi that way everyone gets a chance
6284126 asami konno is a cold fish who likes to watch dirty movies at home with her cat and tsunku
6284127 yes well if you dont have anything constructive to say then ill just be going

6284133 yes and i seem to be having trouble finding my way around i cant even my first class
6284134 okay so all you have to do is go to the end of the hall and take a right down the long corridor there then you go to the third door on the left most corner and go inside now listen carefully because the rest of this gets a little tricky
6284135 actually ive got a little time my next class is study hall so if you want i can just guide you there myself
6284136 because it was bound to happen i knew it would only be a matter of days till you succumbed
6284137 mm well just a word of friendly advice from one mate to another let it go or youll only get hurt
6284138 because you just cant tame a heart like that yossys got a wild rebellious spirit
6284139 poor thing your hysterical over your feelings you must be really hooked
6284140 youre such a help to me you know that i have to go call you back later bye
6284141 its clear to us that the olympics have been a watershed moment for mobile media
6284142 the time sensitive nature of the olympics and the around the clock schedule of events have led many mobile consumers to view their phones as the place to stay connected
6284143 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6284144 they told me there are going to be resources here
6284145 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6284146 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6284147 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6284148 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6284149 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6284150 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6284151 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6284152 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6284153 terrorism is theatre and theatre is always performed for an audience
6284154 i want 12 kids becoming a father makes me want to be a better person
6284155 of course i change diapers what do you take me for
6284156 i want 12 kids becoming a father makes me want to be a better person
6284157 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6284158 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6284159 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6284160 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6284161 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6284162 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6284163 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6284164 i think its ownership people conceptually seeing themselves wearing a uniform
6284165 youre forced to think outside of the box and work around the government
6284166 repost this in 100 seconds or a ghost will rape your dog tonight or some dead skinless girl is gonna rape your mom
6284167 this will have the same power consumption and noise level of current fans
6284168 as soon as we can get it into production we will

6284170 ive got a few ideas for books to write i just need to set aside the time to do it but ive got a cd im working on right now i hope to have it out in may but it keeps getting pushed back all kinds of things are popping up everywhere
6284171 it gives them a chance to be heard and get better
6284172 i like to give everyone a chance to come up and play its just a big mixture
6284173 its weird some nights it might be only 20 or 30 people out and other nights it might be 150 it depends on who is playing
6284174 i know its hard getting the crowd to come out its a shame how people around here miss out on some really good music i have found that the more you involve people the more they will come out
6284175 i got a real job i never really thought about playing music full time guess i probably should have
6284176 but i always had music in my head i would be working in the factory and the sounds would be making beats for me to write songs around i would be coming up with songs like crazy i always wanted to get back into music it just took a while i guess
6284177 then the smoking ban came in and wiped us out there are just not enough all ages venues to play

6284272 ahhh no takahashi san is under the beauty section we have two teams in each beauty section and health section takahashi is in charge of the northern part of central area the team a im in charge of the southern part of central area the team b

6284275 hai takahashi san said the meeting is going to be about the beauty and health convention

6284303 the privilege is now a tool used to protect the government from its own crimes
6284304 theres a lot of people both democrats and republicans that dont want a court to say that the president did something that is a federal crime thats why theyre trying to get all these cases thrown out of court when a federal judge says the president committed a crime its pretty darn hard to ignore that

6284309 steering the course of grp milf peace negotiations for the sake of us interests
6284310 in 2003 the us state department engaged the usip to facilitate a peace agreement between the grp and the milf
6284311 despite the challenges usip managed to build productive relationships with both the grp and milf helped the parties come up with creative solutions to stubborn issues of ancestral domain and started dialogue between disparate moro ethnic groups through its activities usip introduced concepts and approaches that were useful to both government and milf peace panels
6284312 the usip advocated an ancestral domain arrangement that would remain friendly with u s interests
6284313 it is interested solely or mainly in advancing u s interests amidst conditions of armed conflict it merely pretends to facilitate the grp milf peace negotiations when its sees big advantages in doing so
6284314 todays complex diplomatic landscape increasingly requires new tools and techniques of conflict management including quasi and nongovernmental actors to accomplish u s foreign policy goals because of its ability to deal with non state actors and sensitive issues underlying civil conflict usip can be a useful instrument for advancing u s interests
6284315 the filipino people know that the u s covets the oil and other natural resources of mindanao and wants to establish u s military bases there to protect u s imperial interests
6284316 arroyo and her subalterns must be investigated and held accountable for their actions
6284317 to encourage a renewed grp wide effort to conclude an equitable settlement with the moros
6284318 the arroyo government is guilty of allowing such brazen intervention
6284319 arroyo and u s interests likely intersected on the issue of charter change and the prospect of u s investments in mindanao
6284320 the arroyo government pounced on the opening for cha cha as an opportunity to advance its own self serving agenda of term extension
6284321 oil firms have been allowed to further achieve monopoly control over the industry because of deregulation which makes urgent the need for government regulation and control over the local oil sector to help ensure transparency in pricing
6284322 you dont have a search warrant i am not a criminal
6284323 there were two soldiers waiting for you its good they did not chance upon you
6284324 man you have land your graveyard is waiting for you
6284325 why are you rallying against the government when you are using a government vehicle
6284326 it is ours we are taxpayers even your underwear is our property we pay for your salary
6284327 the military cannot claim that it has successfully crushed our organization
6284328 foreign companies process raw materials from our country and sell these to us as finished products
6284329 jurisdiction and control over and the right of exploring for exploiting producing and obtaining all potential sources of energy petroleum in situ fossil fuel mineral oil and natural gas whether onshore or offshore is vested in the bje as the party having control within its territorial jurisdiction provided that in times of national emergency when public interest so requires the central government may during the emergency for a fixed period and under reasonable terms as may be agreed by both parties temporarily assume or direct the operations of such strategic resources
6284330 we were wondering why the grp allowed in the moa ad provisions on changing the countrys legal framework to make possible the establishment of the bje
6284331 the u s has had a big role in the grp milf peace talks since 2003
6284332 toward peace in the southern philippines a summary and assessment of the philippine facilitation project 2003 2007
6284333 the united states will provide diplomatic and financial support to a renewed peace process if the milf will
6284334 the united states absolutely supports the territorial integrity of the philippines we also recognize that the people of mindanao have legitimate aspirations and some grievances
6284335 has repeatedly renounced terrorism publicly as a means of attaining its political ends
6284336 recognizes that the muslims of the southern philippines have serious legitimate grievances that must be addressed
6284337 is concerned about the links between the milf and international terrorist organizations and asks that those links be severed immediately
6284338 the u s offered the milf economic assistance to entice them into the peace talks with the grp
6284339 pfp senior research associate astrid s tuminez undertook extensive research on the history substance and likely trajectories of negotiations over ancestral domain she wrote a white paper which was submitted to members of the grp and milf peace panels subsequently pfp conducted a three day workshop on ancestral domain in mindanao bringing together members of the grp peace panel milf designated representatives and a small group of mindanao experts and observers to listen to and interact directly with international scholars and practitioners who had dealt firsthand with conflicts in their own countries related to ancestral domain e g land resources and governance international participants shared the cases of native americans maoris sri lankans sudanese inuits northern irish and the bougainvillean peoples each expert underlined common threads of conflict over ancestral domain highlighted successes and failures in negotiations and analyzed arrangements reached in their respective case studies none suggested a right way of addressing ancestral domain but all attested to the difficulties associated with negotiations over land resources and governance several experts also emphasized the need to buttress any ancestral domain agreement with institutions procedures and other forms of support toward effective implementation after the ancestral domain workshop dr tuminez wrote a usip special report ancestral domain in comparative perspective which became a reference document for the grp and milf teams copies were provided to the negotiating panels and discussions were held with panel members and advisers pfp also sponsored subsequent visits to manila and mindanao by international experts on ancestral domain conflict resolution and comparative autonomy pfp also shared with the peace panels analyses literature summaries and materials pertinent to ancestral domain autonomy and self determination when members of the negotiating panels requested assistance on specific issues or source materials pfp responded promptly usips initiatives on ancestral domain also motivated the canadian embassy in manila to sponsor a visit to manila and mindanao by canadian government officials and leaders of indigenous groups to share their experience on land claims agreements with the government moros and civil society
6284340 the arroyo government allowed this agreement because it has the support and involvement of the u s
6284341 because of the marshs tremendous actual and potential resources it is likely going to be a focal point of ancestral domain talks
6284342 there is a trap for the milf laid by the u s in the moa ad
6284343 the milf should be on guard because the gains it expects from the moa ad may end up being plundered
6284344 tenho que administrar meu tempo tenho que administrar meu tempo
6284345 whoops sorry the date we told you is no good now were going to be another 2 weeks later on our ship date

6284348 eh i cant see any reason why that baby should stay in longer than next week your bp is creeping up and things can easily go wrong with the placenta at this stage of the pregnancy why tempt fate when we can get the baby out amp hell be fine
6284349 i need to check out the schedule but head home amp wait by the phone one of us will call amp tell you when amp where you need to check in okay see ya
6284350 from six hundred to go or so i think the gap really opened up and it was tough im disappointed i wanted to make the final but ill look at it tonight and tomorrow and try to decide how bad it was it certainly wasnt as planned but just wait and see
6284351 it felt good actually believe it or not i mean it felt good for ten and a half laps eleven laps actually with 500 to go i was going to make a move and the qatari beat me to it and i thought this is good ill just follow him and after about 50 or 60 metres of that that was it i just couldnt go anymore i dont know why i just wasnt good enough
6284352 ive got no excuses every heat was just as hard as the other and if i was concerned about not finishing in the top four i wouldve taken the pace up myself you didnt have to run that quick to get through on times and i backed my ability to make it in the top four and it bit me
6284353 i think i could go into races and win medals every time but it wasnt meant to be the olympics is where everyone is at their best i believe im at my best and thats where im at
6284354 its not as easy as it looks and you can be comfortable running sixty six sixty sevens which i was then an injection of pace stung me i dont know why ive got no excuses i just didnt have it semi finals are designed to get rid of the weaker runners and obviously tonight i wasnt going to get a medal anyway off of that performance so you know thats the sport
6284355 it hurts because i am a good distance runner but unfortunately its the semi finals of the olympics and they take only four thats the nature of the beast
6284356 nothing nothing nothing wrong nothing wrong ive trained as i said perfectly preparation was great i ran the race i wanted to tonight i was in the right spot all the time i was relaxed i looked good i was watching the screen to see what was going on i knew kenenisa was behind me and when the pressure came on i wasnt good enough simple
6284357 ich freue mich tierisch es war nat rlich recht knapp bis zum ersten und zweiten aber ich bin bergl cklich
6284358 ich denke bei olympia kann man nur von gewonnenen medaillen sprechen
6284359 ich habe es immer wieder ausgeleert jetzt brennt es ein bisschen
6284360 ich habe mich 700 meter vor dem ziel ein bisschen behakt das hat vielleicht zu viel kraft gekostet

6284362 pada asasnya islam meletakan peraturan yang jelas bagi memungkinkan keadilan dicapai melalui proses kehakiman dan pembuktian terlebih dahulu sebelum sebarang sumpah dilafazkan
6284363 perkara yang berlaku ini akan memberi kesan buruk antara lain kepada perlaksanaan sistem kehakiman syariah di malaysia apabila pada masa akan datang pelbagai pihak boleh menggunakan ini sebagai presedent bagi mendahulukan sumpah terutama dalam kes lian sebelum proses kehakiman dilakukan

6284401 ahora luego de cuatro a os de buscar buscar rebuscar rebuscar y no encontrar ning n acto de malversaci n de fondos p blicos de soborno de robo de fondos p blicos regresan al ataque contra todo aquel que se les enfrente
6284402 ustedes saben que eso es lo que yo he sido toda mi vida un servidor p blico lo he hecho cumpliendo la m xima que me ense mi padre el ex juez y senador salvador acevedo de que al servicio p blico se viene a servir no a servirse

6284406 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6284407 tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
6284408 goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6284409 it is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6284410 i think this is a classic illustration here where affirmative action has reared its ugly head against them
6284411 believes it is proper to kill a baby that has survived an abortion
6284412 wants the doctors chasing it through the delivery room to make sure it gets killed
6284413 a bortion foes are now accusing sen barack obama of being an abortion rights extremist
6284414 the truth only holds if it makes perfect sense to you it is not what someone else thinks it to be if you believe something is true and you have seen it work for yourself no one else can discourage you from that
6284415 we have been told from an early age that if we do wrong we shall die and go to a frightening place called hell we believe that what others perceive as sin are just the negative memories stored by our brain once we confess and confront them they cease to haunt us and we regain our freedom
6284416 when christians say you can move mountains by faith they are not far from the truth once you unlock your spirituality you will be able to do exactly that
6284417 my son daughter in law grandsons and grand daughters have gone missing please help us find them i can no longer live without them i wish to see my grandsons before i die
6284418 i lost my son and mother in the flood please help find them
6284419 i have been looking for my nine year old brother for three days but in vain
6284420 my family might have been swept away by the flood by now
6284421 the supreme court came up with a verdict asking the government to take action to protect the rights of the kumari
6284422 the court ruled there were no historic or religious documents that state the child should be denied the rights of education movement etc she should not be denied these things just because she is the kumari
6284423 this is not good news in any case she is a goddess so how can court rulings apply
6284424 her teacher comes to the kumari palace every day and she has three hours a day when she can meet people
6284425 we will ask the goddess if she wants to go outside more and if she wants she can go but i dont think she feels comfortable leaving the palace
6284426 one of the biggest reasons for stallone working in kambakth is the money hes offered even though rocky balboa opened well it didnt do as well as the other movies in the series
6284427 i have stayed in his mansion at beverly hills and driven in his million dollar car so i dont know where all this is coming from but its interesting how hollywood is sitting up and taking notice of our talent weve grown up watching stallones movies how much money he made or his financial background was not my concern when i signed him if bollywood is doing well for itself there definitely will be attempts to pull it down
6284428 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan for the champions trophy obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the taskforce which we did we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it our position hasnt changed
6284429 i would say im lucky that i have got an offer to work in telugu film opposite shankar not many women are fortunate enough to get an opportunity like this in the entertainment industry i believe i can shine in the telugu industry give my best and do well this industry is very particular about any performers acting skills and the audience too is obsessed with cinema and is always observing the stars so an actor just cant escape by giving a mediocre performance and expect to be popular i think im well prepared enough to make my own mark in the industry
6284430 i have heard about it i dont know from where all the rumours started but when they say i look like trisha they must also be expecting me to perform as well as her im a bit worried about that comparison but otherwise i have taken the comment quite lightly
6284431 i suddenly knew why i couldnt recognise her when i met her life has put her through so much she had changed
6284432 but she had to be whisked away immediately from lonavla on monday early tuesday morning she had her flight from where she had to be taken for chemotherapy in london
6284433 speaking to her was not easy it was very tough there was never any rancour
6284434 yes i was hurt when in the big brother house she made some comments about our country but even in the house we made peace after the initial rancour once out the media went to town and she got the brunt of it it was really sad when jade was slammed i never wanted to become a champion of the third world at her cost
6284435 yeah when the channel decided on jade they asked me if it was okay with me if i had any ill feelings towards her id have said no but the truth is there was no ill feelings my only precondition was that jade should be treated well at big boss i knew how it felt to go to a foreign country and be in a hostile situation i felt so proud to see how she was treated it just reiterated the fact we indians are very forgiving and welcoming
6284436 but ashtavinayak recently gifted an expensive watch worth rs 15 lakh to oberoi following which the date problem was sorted out
6284437 akshay has been very sweet and keeps calling sanju paaji there are no problems with him sanju is very happy with the director these rumours must have started because akshay has a reputation of interfering with and cut the scenes of his co stars i had heard there was a similar problem with akshay and sanju in amaanat but i dont know exactly what it was baba is leaving for bangkok today for blue till september 18 after which he will shoot for a song with lara
6284438 shooting is going as per schedule and sanjay dutt will join us on august 24 and akshay will join on august 26 both share a cordial relationship on the sets
6284439 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6284440 theyll say hes young hes got a funny name hes not patriotic
6284441 barack obamas own campaign is the only one talking about his patriotism
6284442 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work
6284443 we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we should give companies tax breaks that are right here
6284444 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6284445 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6284446 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6284447 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6284448 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6284449 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6284450 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6284451 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6284452 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6284453 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6284454 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6284455 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6284456 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed

6284458 over the years weve had hundreds of people work on the game and we thank everyone who helped us bring our warhammer passion to life but only current employees that have continued until the end will be credited in the final game
6284459 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because
6284460 we had an awesome car all day i felt like i ran the most patient race i have ever run at bristol i kept my emotions in check all day and thought from that side everything was going really well that second to last set of tires we put on made us really free and we dropped back to fifth then we came in and put tires on under caution and with that last set of tires we were tight i couldnt turn it through the center of the corner at all its hard when everybody gets their cars right at the end of the race and you become a little bit off it was hard to hold those guys back so we just tried to race smart there and bring our car home in one piece
6284461 its one of my favorites but bristol is a track thats feast or famine if you have a really good day its a lot of fun but if you have one little problem it normally makes for a very long day weve had more long days than good days
6284462 if you win races the points take care of themselves every week when we go to the track were going to try to win the race and if we cant win well finish as high as we can and get as many points as we can once we do that the points will just have to be what they are
6284463 well take it one day at a time i mean were not worried about anything because we just have to go and do our job every week were not reinventing the wheel here we just dont need to have any bad luck thats what it really boils down to were not doing anything differently you just cant afford to have a bad day you dont have to have a great day but you just cant afford to have a bad day
6284464 i dont think itll be any different i still think when it comes to racing guys are simply just racing i think at the end of the day they look at the point standings but for the most part the whole time youre out there youre worried about winning the race or doing as well as you can i really dont think peoples mindsets will change
6284465 bristol is awesome you can go from the bottom to the top and with the old surface you just couldnt do that if you got hung on the outside you were stuck and if you tried to force your way back into line thats when trouble would typically start i dont know what its like to watch but from where i sit racing at bristol is pretty fun you can run all over the race track which is whats so fun about it you can race guys arent running over each other to pass each other you can work the outside you can work the inside you can go and race people instead of the normal just bump people out of the way and go on by style we used to have you arent having to root guys out of the way we should thank everybody at bristol motor speedway for doing what they did it worked and it worked well i cant give it a better grade than a plus
6284466 you just dont have time to relax everything happens so fast at the end of the day when the race is done and your adrenaline wears off youre worn out but when youre in the car and the adrenalines pumping you dont get in that smooth calm rhythm that you do at a place like michigan or california where youve got big sweeping corners and long straightaways theres no time to relax you dont get that luxury at bristol its standard short track racing
6284467 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
6284468 the challenge did not flinch from tackling some of the toughest problems in education it worked in inner cities and isolated rural areas to improve education for children who were most often poor or minorities the challenge did not work miracles but it frequently beat the odds and helped public schools do better the challenge proved that public education can work it was time and money well spent
6284469 what is it dr sims what is the problem with the schools
6284470 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because
6284471 a guaranteed monthly rate for two years without the hassle of a term commitment like those of cable companies
6284472 ive been saying for a long time that the 200 meters means a lot more to me than the 100
6284473 ive been dreaming about the 200 since i was yea high im real happy with myself real proud right now
6284474 i wish i was in sandals right now just taking the weekend and going to the quarter
6284475 hes not what we sprinters should look like he could possibly do the same thing in the 400
6284476 we never thought a man would run a 9 6 and he did it we never thought a man would run 19 3 and he did it how fast can a man go before he can go no faster
6284477 hes so good because hes 6 5 and he runs like hes 5 9
6284478 hes a phenom said american walter dix who took the bronze
6284479 the guy is bad he came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6284480 hes got to get to 26 27 28 before he reaches his proverbial prime
6284481 hes a baby as he gets stronger it will get scary we will all want to say we saw the evolution
6284482 hes doing things that no man of his stature could do and its a beautiful thing and hes beautiful to watch the stride it is poetry in motion
6284483 hes blessed with a unique anatomy a huge competitive heart and hes having a good time
6284484 anything is possible if i put my mind to it
6284485 im looking forward to my birthday actually im 22 now
6284486 so im looking forward to going to sleep with double world records
6284487 ive never been that player thats been overly close with my teammates
6284488 we all are so busy im 27 years old we have our lives at home i have my great support system at home you come in here and youre as close as you need to be to get things done
6284489 i think not just winning but being in a foreign country living in the village traveling together you definitely get closer
6284490 mixed zone interview area a gaggle of american writers were all waiting with the same question has she redeemed herself or did she even feel the need to
6284491 i dont think its a personal thing anymore i think its our team wanting to reclaim what we could have gotten in the world cup
6284492 it has nothing to do with personal anything right now our teams playing out of their minds
6284493 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because
6284494 would usually smile and nod and say that i understood the skepticism but that there was and always had been another tradition to politics a tradition based on the simple idea that we have a stake in one another and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart and that if enough people believe in the truth of that proposition and act on it then we might not solve every problem but we can get something meaningful done
6284495 enough of them appreciated my earnestness and youthful swagger that i made it to the illinois legislature
6284496 s ome of the problems include printing registered voters name sic instead of writing a female voter got married after she registered to vote and signed her maiden name registered voters signed the petitions but dont live in the 13th district
6284497 the justice department would certainly want to take a serious look at that because it would mean that a firm that would want to take advertisements or to place advertisements would have only one place to go
6284498 a yahoo microsoft merger would primarily be designed to attack google
6284499 should there be moves to make this agreement permanent we will examine it closely in the antitrust subcommittee to ensure that it does not harm competition
6284500 operating in the front ranks of those transforming the internet into the global marketplace of the future
6284501 dti appears to rank in the top 1 percent of adult entertainment companies in the world
6284502 i have worked with thousands of people around the world in the last 30 years countless of whom including legislators governors united states presidents ceos and self made billionaires all of whom i personally made aware of earlier mistakes and would be happy to sing my praises
6284503 sitting and watching dora dvds is quite different from playing dora in a game
6284504 its definitely more engaging and the brand affiliation is stronger in an interactive setting
6284505 what video is to tv games are to the web for us to be relevant to our audience that is where we need to put our investment
6284506 young people dont always know who they can talk to and like this they can get that information on their phone which they are using all the time anyway
6284507 in most cases there is no cost for the users since many have unlimited text messaging plans with their mobile phone company
6284508 we have a new improved offer to put to our members
6284509 because of the improved offer all planned industrial action is suspended until we get the reaction of the members
6284510 this does not affect the industrial action for the scanner workers who are employed by airport services
6284511 ive only done three races and am still learning and i have probably been done here for experience
6284512 i gave it everything and that was what i wanted to do and i have something to show for it
6284513 i like swimming from the front but that last lap was a real struggle and the final section was a blur i was delirious but the stretcher at the end was a bit mad
6284514 insects living very closely in nutrient rich environments are hotbeds for micro organisms they need mechanisms to protect against disease
6284515 honeybee queens are hedging their bets by mating with many males
6284516 this is convincing evidence that multiple mated hives seem to suffer less disease
6284517 there are lots of ideas in this area but not many good experimental studies
6284518 even the best case scenario 9 or 10 on top of the normal high mortality in the life of a juvenile salmon is pretty scary
6284519 as technology advances we need to make sure we as the government and reimbursement procedures we set in place really allow that technology to thrive and both save us money and improve their lifestyle
6284520 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6284521 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6284522 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6284523 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6284524 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6284525 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6284526 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6284527 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6284528 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6284529 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6284530 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6284531 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6284532 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6284533 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans
6284534 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do
6284535 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6284536 we currently have the lowest standard variable rate of all the major banks and st george
6284537 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6284538 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6284539 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6284540 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6284541 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6284542 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6284543 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6284544 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6284545 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6284546 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6284547 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6284548 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6284549 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6284550 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6284551 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6284552 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6284553 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6284554 life is not a matter of chance its a matter of choice
6284555 mincor is targeting production of between 19 500 and 20 500 tonnes of nickel metal in ore for the 2009 financial year
6284556 in line with the lower nickel price the company has moved rapidly to switch its production focus from volume to margin and is targeting a substantial reduction in its cash costs
6284557 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6284558 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6284559 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6284560 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6284561 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6284562 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6284563 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6284564 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6284565 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6284566 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6284567 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6284568 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6284569 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6284570 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6284571 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6284572 the synergies of putting the two companies together was never justified on cost savings but we will be pursuing those cost savings
6284573 weve identified in the last 50 days 27 5 million of annual ongoing cost savings from the integration and one off merger implementation costs of 41 million
6284574 our target is to make sure we get a one year pay back on it so we have to identify in excess of 40 million in ongoing annual cost savings
6284575 however london metals exchange lme prices for copper and zinc in australian dollars have been volatile
6284576 in the first half of 2008 copper was 6 2 per cent higher on average than in the previous six months while zinc was 31 7 per cent lower
6284577 this outcome combined with the generally higher operating costs has been the primary reason that the financial performance we are reporting today is not better
6284578 continue to look at it if prices keep being driven down
6284579 some 15 per cent of steel that is produced is coated in zinc so on one hand there is still a very optimistic approach in the market towards steel consumption and yet there is this pessimism around zinc
6284580 i think there is short term movement by institutions in the speculative side of the lme and thats where youre seeing the prices being pushed below the top end of the cost curve
6284581 what were seeing in the marketplace now with cut backs in production stopping of projects and the like is the producers saying guys you got the price number wrong we will not produce at this level
6284582 were a long consumer of energy and short in supply of it and it would fit in as a natural hedge in our energy portfolio
6284583 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6284584 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6284585 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6284586 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6284587 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6284588 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6284589 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6284590 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6284591 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6284592 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6284593 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6284594 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6284595 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6284596 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6284597 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6284598 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6284599 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6284600 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6284601 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6284602 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6284603 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6284604 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6284605 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6284606 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6284607 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6284608 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6284609 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6284610 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6284611 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6284612 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6284613 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6284614 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6284615 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6284616 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6284617 i was gobsmacked when he took the shirt and signed it he didnt have any problems with it at all if i was one of berbatovs team mates or a fan id be furious it is incredibly disrespectful he may as well have kissed the united badge
6284618 get in the car get in th car and make them take you to the end of the trail

6284620 oops i dont see her i hope shes not getting into any trouble i better go find her
6284621 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6284622 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6284623 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6284624 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6284625 we are moving towards the selection of a permanent director whether it be at the hospital or public health

6284631 sin oclock in the morning my plane just touches the ground my bodys here but my heart stays there cause it knows what ive found
6284632 see the storms broken in the middle of the night
6284633 whatever i said whatever i did i didnt mean it i just want you back for good
6284634 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6284635 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6284636 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6284637 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6284638 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6284639 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6284640 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

6284646 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6284647 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6284648 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6284649 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6284650 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6284651 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6284652 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6284653 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6284654 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6284655 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6284656 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6284657 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6284658 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6284659 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6284660 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6284661 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6284662 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6284663 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6284664 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6284665 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6284666 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6284667 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6284668 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6284669 the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth
6284670 and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
6284671 it also revealed what pilgrims most wanted at wyd08 was a spiritual experience and in that context to see and listen to the holy father
6284672 they said they wanted a closer relationship with god and jesus they wanted to really live what they believe and to have a stronger sense of what it means to be catholic
6284673 the older group was very focused on spiritual values they were making sacrifices to take a week out to come to wyd08 so they were not messing around their spirituality was very full on and so was their approach to wyd08 they saw it as sacred time
6284674 the younger group were unabashedly attracted to all the aspects of wyd08 which naturally appeal to younger people they loved the adventure of it the excitement of being part of a huge youth crowd travelling to a spectacular city making new friends celebrating it might be a religious occasion but it had lots of other appeal as well
6284675 the pilgrims were not just a random collection of younger catholics they were special they took some trouble to get to this gathering they wanted to be there
6284676 there was a surprisingly strong measure of spirituality among teenagers in this group wed got the impression from previous research that especially the younger ones were not much involved with the local church
6284677 however that only seems to be the case with only about a quarter of the younger group
6284678 nearly half of them are regular churchgoers have a strong faith and a firm sense of catholic identity
6284679 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6284680 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6284681 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6284682 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6284683 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6284684 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6284685 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6284686 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6284687 we have a three year plan of what were doing
6284688 assuming a road to success which we are assuring glorious war which were going to get and we have three years worth of where weve decided where were going we have two years after that of whats sort of like whats more smoky and i suppose were going in this direction and itll just keep rolling like that all the way through
6284689 i guess if i told you jeff hickman senior producer for war would karate kick that door come in here and then you would have an interview where youd have to explain what it was like seeing his boots which have leather flames being pressed on my throat were not talking about the expansion other than we have relentless meetings about it itll be awesome obviously
6284690 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6284691 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6284692 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6284693 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6284694 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6284695 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6284696 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6284697 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6284698 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6284699 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6284700 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6284701 this is a planning took where all things are going
6284702 big daddy do you like the chrome wheels how about the strawberry air freshener dangling off the mirror i had to drive with all of the windows down to avoid barfing
6284703 a loaner though im not sure who im specifically borrowing it from every preset station is rap
6284704 ive been beyond reasonable with papa sven and at this point it doesnt even make sense to fix him

6284706 well i leave thursday for guatemala and ill be gone until labor day then you guysll be gone so i can take one of your cars thatll get me to mid september
6284707 you know dont get mad at me but youre kinda acting like your mother
6284708 you mean your wife but that taunting wont hurt this time cause that womans on her fourth benz and to be honest i admire her refusal to let you push her into another piece of shit cutlass sierra
6284709 have you thought about the chevy malibu or the new hyundai genesis
6284710 no but i have thought about putting you in the trunk of papa sven and pushing both of you off a high cliff
6284711 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
6284712 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone
6284713 because she is a single woman who has no children she loses her reason because of her late single status
6284714 i can be president of the united states or i can attend to alice i cannot possibly do both

6284718 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6284719 everytime you smile at someone it is an action of love a gift to that person a beautiful thing
6284720 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6284721 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6284722 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6284723 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6284724 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6284725 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6284726 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6284727 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6284728 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6284729 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6284730 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6284731 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6284732 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6284733 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6284734 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6284735 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6284736 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6284737 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6284738 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6284739 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6284740 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6284741 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6284742 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6284743 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6284744 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6284745 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6284746 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6284747 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6284748 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6284749 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6284750 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6284751 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6284752 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6284753 fear of switching is the foundation of customer loyalty for pcs
6284754 best business articles from around the web issue number one
6284755 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now
6284756 dent lies at the bottom of the hole his neck broken
6284757 im trying to do whatever i have to do to get the offense going were trying to execute well as an offense right now so we can take it into the season
6284758 but now its pretty easy i feel very comfortable now
6284759 i was seeing a lot of space in front of me and i thought if i win this one on one battle its a touchdown for me mitch mustain saw the same thing and hit me
6284760 they know a lot and its very tough going out there against them because they know the coverages and they know how to stop certain routes
6284761 we see new things every day because of their experience
6284762 we have to prepare in meetings just to go against this defense and run our plays
6284763 were just going out there to compete were not worried about whos starting or whos getting the most playing time were just going out there to contribute as a team
6284764 i never thought that id be out here playing football at usc and now that im here i get to play with all these great guys making me better
6284765 we know a lot more and were doing a lot better
6284766 first we build a space mirror then if that doesnt work well fall back to the artificial volcano it may be a long shot but nothing else will save the american way of life
6284767 for people to begin to take a proactive approach to their health they really need to know what their percentage of fat versus muscle is
6284768 most studies have shown that by just adding one circumference measurement at the waist to bmi you can better predict a patients risk for type 2 diabetes and for all cause mortality waist circumference is also about twice as good at predicting future coronary heart disease than bmi alone
6284769 op een kaart geschreven telkens wanneer ik op zijn zenuwen werk houdt hij die kaart omhoog
6284770 the free market centrism of the clinton years to a revived push for european style social democracy
6284771 this is in many respects a deeply un american solution to the problems facing our country
6284772 one that would emphasize dependence over self sufficiency and bureaucratic condescension over self help
6284773 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
6284774 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
6284775 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
6284776 this is my prayer in the desert when all thats within me feels dry this is my prayer in my hunger and need my god is the god who provides
6284777 a job americans wont do even at 34 an hour
6284778 bravo and sayonara to being fat this is cause for celebration so bring on a few five pound boxes of fudge and as much buttered popcorn as can be stuffed into the family min van and a u haul trailer
6284779 idiot just as we warned you it is hopeless and a complete waste of time to even try to lose weight to hell with celery sticks and water
6284780 bring on a dozen bbqed short ribs three pounds of mashed potatoes smothered in real butter and any fudge and popcorn not consumed this morning when you celebrated that short lived weight loss
6284781 it builds a community that i am so proud to be part of
6284782 its that place between fear and arousal and they are so very closely related
6284783 i will rend you from the inside out i will rape you and spread your soul open for the birds to pick clean you will be mistaken for the flood dead in the creek
6284784 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6284785 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6284786 i think i love you but what am i so afraid of
6284787 here are a few other word issues that come up in sex writing that throw me off and drive me crazy

6284794 something happened somewhere along the way though i began to care
6284795 ive tried a lot of things as you can imagine but there were even a few new things in there for me
6284796 being able to decline a call is great but bills still need to be paid
6284797 upon looking at my creamy white and feeling my soft lips you would think i am an angel
6284798 lying back so the full aura from the lamp lights the area in question i spread my legs and let him see
6284799 why am i using x are there other simpler ways of achieving this goal
6284800 its strangely refreshing to really submit and give up that control and not have to make decisions
6284801 he tells me to hold still in that soft controlling voice of his
6284802 you thought you could just come to my room and tease me
6284803 hes a shill for some of mccains worst attacks on obama
6284804 the democrats wont need him to retain the majority in the next senate
6284805 weve had to make some severe budget cuts to balance this budget
6284806 if the company were to fold all of those organizations the orchestra would struggle or feel the pain also
6284807 a very serious impact on us obviously it is a great deal of money and we dont have a plan in place to offset that loss
6284808 its something wed rather not do because it adds so much to the performance
6284809 although the companys artistic leadership and product have never been better the administrative leadership has not kept pace
6284810 it is unfortunate they feel that way because both venues allow more people in the dallas area to enjoy the ballet at affordable prices
6284811 the majestic theater has consistently lost money assisting the ballet because we felt it was a better venue for them and they must have agreed because they were here for the last six years
6284812 our mantra now is to have 2 million in pledges by the middle of september
6284813 i have it by my phone to remind me of that goal every day
6284814 i made it a personal effort to call around to the residents in sharon to get them to come out and vote not necessarily for me but just to come out to the polls
6284815 im pleased with the outcome especially because i didnt run much of a campaign other than talking to people in town
6284816 i know i went through a learning curve when i was appointed but fortunately i have had the help of the trustees
6284817 and i feel more confident that we can continue to focus on the jobs at hand because both of them have retained their seats as well
6284818 i cant speak for the others but as far as myself i dont see my position as a political job its a job
6284819 i have work to do and i am going to do what i was elected to do
6284820 i dont have any anxiety about my responsibilities i walk in have my priorities and get them done
6284821 i know in the past some of the constituents have complained about the lack of communication with the supervisors position
6284822 if someone calls i try to get back to them within a few hours to a day
6284823 i am very excited about looking at the possibility of the township partnering with the commission
6284824 if someone wants to come talk with me i am available
6284825 i am fortunate that enough people in the township know that i am reachable
6284826 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6284827 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6284828 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6284829 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect
6284830 theres an important message here and we need to ensure it is translated into preventative work in pregnant women to reduce the risk
6284831 hey some backup app wanted a snapshot please take one

6284833 at warner park wed go out there a lot of times and there would be eight or nine different teams practicing and wed just divide up fields work together and everyone would use it and enjoy it
6284834 our intent was to protect the investment and let the leagues play
6284835 if they want to have a league on a certain day then fine but the rest of time everyone should be able to use it were all paying for the park its a very nice facility that nobody can use its just a waste of money
6284836 weve decided we are going to allow practices by permit only
6284837 im not the sort of person to just accept things
6284838 it may be because of my leg but i will always try to push myself challenge myself
6284839 if i can get better i might be able to help other people get better
6284840 even then i wanted to set something up but i couldnt think of anything
6284841 i ended up getting a job working in an it department
6284842 it became quite serious but i guess i was able to hide it from my friends
6284843 almost instantly i began to gain control over the panic attacks
6284844 i was a lot calmer some thing broke away and i could see that light i knew i couldnt carry on doing nothing

6284848 well aim to be a conduit between the community and the hospital project team and the health board
6284849 theres a real need for it to be marlborough its very much that everybody wants marlborough to take ownership to put ideas forward and suggestions
6284850 weve had one meeting to get to know each other
6284851 were now going to go back into the community and talk with interested groups about the chapel the gardens the childrens area rehabilitation unit talk to people who have had experience in those areas and get some feedback
6284852 marlborough is an incredibly generous province there are a number of projects here that never wouldve happened elsewhere
6284853 i know the marlborough community will want to raise funds but we wont be making those decisions
6284854 someone may say to the board that theyve raised 50 000 and theyd like it to go towards the chapel
6284855 the board then can ask us to find out what the best way is to spend it
6284856 i dont think its ever been done with any other hospital thats been built the community here has got its finger on the pulse before we know it it will be up and running
6284857 a cabinet of old x ray equipment sitting in the current radiology department may be some of the specimens that require special treatment
6284858 its a huge compliment to blenheim that our community has been recognised in this way for its care and concern for the needy
6284859 its a retention initiative and were letting the strategy on this emerge
6284860 content owners have a mandate to get their content to as many customers as possible while avoiding distribution costs and making their content as accessible as they can
6284861 the entertainment side gives isps the ability to differentiate since its easier to sell movies or video content than just selling people a fast connection so were going to get as much content as we can online look at what customers are using and what theyre excited by and see what we should pursue in the future
6284862 we talked about a lot of things situational hitting defensive positioning and staying positive
6284863 theres a slight danger after playing so many first place teams the last few weeks that we might have a bit of a letdown going into the oakland series
6284864 we shouldnt theyre ahead of us and a long way ahead of us theyve handled us pretty well
6284865 youve got to remember that weve got guys fighting for jobs fighting for careers fighting to establish themselves as major league players
6284866 i havent seen anyone on this team quit giving up is unacceptable

6284876 i heard that you were frustrated with your resolution from our customer service department the other day how may i help you
6284877 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6284878 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6284879 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6284880 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6284881 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6284882 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6284883 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6284884 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6284885 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6284886 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6284887 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show

6284889 i think that all students should go to school because they need all the education they need
6284890 i think its not right because kids need their education to survive in life
6284891 i want to feel like im making a difference because like i said the school i do to its kind of bad because we dont have books like at all we dont have any books and our computers that we do have are really bad it just needs to be different
6284892 i want to provide that happy secure safe learning environment
6284893 everything is frozen so even if you can cut the trees you cant pull them out its like pulling a sword from a stone
6284894 yeah but why did it have to happen to us
6284895 the troubled u s economy has been a complex story for journalists to report and tell how did the media cover the slump was that coverage timely and to what it extent did it influence public attitudes about the state of the economy a new pej study examines those questions
6284896 your starting quarterback has to be ready for the first regular season game
6284897 the guys that have played as long as he has played you are not quite as concerned about their minutes in the preseason now i want him to feel better thats my main concern but as far as not playing or not getting enough reps i dont worry about that too much
6284898 its only because he has to be just right for buffalo
6284899 were going to take it one day at a time and just see how it feels
6284900 i was hoping wed have him for the first ball game and i said it before the important thing is how he feels about it
6284901 you come off that particular surgery and its a bugger its tough it doesnt really matter what i think its important how he feels and how hes going to do this
6284902 all those lists and things take a back seat to his ability to play and when he can play and that determination hasnt been made yet
6284903 this season shows that you should never give up there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points
6284904 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently
6284905 from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the fewer there are the more important they become
6284906 i think the championship will be very tight but i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race this is the sole aim the rest is just details
6284907 we need to score a decent return of points whenever we can and be consistent and as competitive as we can
6284908 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
6284909 thats made getting strong results even more important so i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
6284910 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and were confident well be competitive this weekend
6284911 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
6284912 ive only seen the new track from an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit
6284913 i always love to drive on new tracks and im always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
6284914 it will be more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on qualifying will be extremely important although i think there are some possibilities to overtake
6284915 if its hot that will help ferrari like at montreal you also need a bit of luck
6284916 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team here at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me
6284917 going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
6284918 i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
6284919 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
6284920 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races

6284926 you play every game hard you play to win this time of year a lot of guys have aches and pains and they play through them thats what were paid to do the situation doesnt matter you can be in first place or last place theres only one way to play the game
6284927 when you go through a bad stretch like this its tough on fans the players the players wives
6284928 it affects a lot of people these guys are suffering and i tell them not to take it home with them your wife didnt hang that slider
6284929 you cant keep telling guys the same thing over and over its tough losing like this its tough on all of us
6284930 as a business we could end up losing charter work from a school because we are taking kids away from that school
6284931 we are offering a service so we have to bring them in to town once the eligible school run ends but there have been times when we have wanted to send the bus off somewhere else
6284932 it was just not a matter that in the circumstances could come to pass
6284933 at this stage the likely outcome is that it will be closed until auction

6285026 nearly 17 million australians have watched all or part of our coverage over the past 10 days a figure very close to the audience reach achieved in the coverage of the games in sydney
6285027 it is the same broadcast production model as undertaken during the olympic games in sydney given the timezone similarities indeed we are probably exceeding live or near live on these games more than other games
6285028 viewers are probably more aware of the games as our record breaking audiences underline given it is happening in our time and not overnight
6285029 were television covering an olympic games were not a wire service or online

6285037 weve had one meeting to get to know each other
6285038 were now going to go back into the community and talk with interested groups about the chapel the gardens the childrens area rehabilitation unit talk to people who have had experience in those areas and get some feedback
6285039 marlborough is an incredibly generous province there are a number of projects here that never wouldve happened elsewhere
6285040 i know the marlborough community will want to raise funds but we wont be making those decisions
6285041 someone may say to the board that theyve raised 50 000 and theyd like it to go towards the chapel
6285042 the board then can ask us to find out what the best way is to spend it
6285043 i dont think its ever been done with any other hospital thats been built the community here has got its finger on the pulse before we know it it will be up and running

6285047 its just like saying that because islam is the countrys official religion other faiths have inferior status to it i dont think this is so because one of the basic tenets of islam is the principle of equality
6285048 taking an opportunity to criticise islam and that she has a racist attitude

6285050 we will likely see the 7 billion mark passed within four years
6285051 and by 2050 global population is projected to rise to 9 3 billion between now and mid century these diverging growth patterns will boost the population share living in todays less developed countries from 82 percent to 86 percent
6285052 capitol briefing apologizes for the error and will be more careful as he continues to report this story
6285053 i think theres a lot of soul searching going on here about this
6285054 how can monetary base growth slow for seven straight years without pushing inflation down if you agree with friedman it should have caused a decline in inflation but every measure of inflation is higher not lower
6285055 do these lawsuits work in the sense of recovering monetary awards only occasionally
6285056 is a great place to watch a scienc y flick
6285057 as well as being academically challenging with the possibility of students going on to do a phd the course has been designed with the needs of industry firmly in mind
6285058 i deal for the self employed who want to use information and communications technology in their business or those attempting to integrate it into employment or education
6285059 he was out on the street a lot and he always saw the bad part that happened to kids and he knew that if we could provide them with better information and better contact with police officers it was going to make it easier for the students to say no to the things that were going on
6285060 he felt if they had the right tools it would be easier for them to make it in this world
6285061 when he was having to confront something that was a problem whether it was a speeder or someone who was burglarizing he would always try to talk them down he would always try to put god in his conversation
6285062 he was one of those guys you wanted to make happy
6285063 our neighbors used to call and say have him sing louder or have him sing softer
6285064 he sang everywhere and we used to call him the de composer because if he didnt like particular words or remember particular words hed make up his own
6285065 it just made him appear to be overconfident like he owned the world
6285066 and i guess to him he did because he was so happy with his life
6285067 mom you just have to reach down find your inner self and believe you can do it mom you dont need me believe in yourself mom
6285068 the single best predictor of church participation turned out to be belief orthodox christian belief and especially the teaching that a person can be saved only through jesus christ amazingly enough fully 68 of those who are still active presbyterians dont believe it
6285069 the churches desperate hunger to mean more in politics and economics had the perverse effect of making them less effective opponents of the political and economic pressures on the nation they mattered more when they wanted to matter less
6285070 the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority
6285071 we have to be forgiving and show love and grace
6285072 these guys deserve an ass kicking of discipline by the church
6285073 its a huge compliment to blenheim that our community has been recognised in this way for its care and concern for the needy
6285074 have rates of homicide that are low despite rates of home firearm ownership that are at least as high as those in the united states
6285075 what people have got to understand is its now a normal market ive been in real estate for 13 years and ive spent more time in this kind of market a normal kind of market than the boom market
6285076 im in a peculiar position really i have a due sentiment to china as its my birthplace but new zealand is where i grew up and am accustomed to
6285077 we tried to wonder how the heck they did that
6285078 the nation steps in to mature them and train them and help them all the success they have in recent years is the result
6285079 those people who come out on top they are really set up for life
6285080 here you receive sponsorship by a corporation if you win but in china the government helps you
6285081 things like that im dead against they have to go through this learning process this period going from one extreme in which they were subjugated and felt inferior but its a very thin line
6285082 standard amp poors views the new zealand government as supportive of kiwibank although this support may vary with any government change
6285083 despite improving earnings and rapid annual growth averaging more than 60 percent since inception kiwibanks operations lack sufficient scale to ensure a material improvement in its financial profile which results in kiwibanks moderate profitability
6285084 the ratings on kiwibank remain equalised with those on nz post given that the parent provides an unconditional guarantee that covers all of the banks senior obligations
6285085 the biggest risk to nz posts ratings remains the impact of its ownership and guarantee of kiwibank

6285089 the 64 000 question with morales is will all the problems drift south to bolivia and will we have to start all over again
6285090 there is no eradication and at this moment thats my concern
6285091 in his speeches evo morales handles some variables that are very interesting
6285092 i think it can work if there is a coherent strategy
6285093 if theres one thing the international community should do if only out of deference because he won the election is to take seriously his arguments that coca products have a place in the international commodities market
6285094 one of our most important products is granola fortified with coca
6285095 right now we are selling everything in bolivia but the hope is to sell in china
6285096 what we want to show is that the coca leaf is not just for cocaine
6285097 but that you can do many things with it and generate work
6285098 coca is our daily bread what gives us work what gives us our livelihood
6285099 in other countries they say coca is drugs but we dont use drugs its the gringos who use drugs
6285100 but once out it goes to labs for cocaine we cannot escort every truck to market
6285101 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6285102 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6285103 these findings add to a growing literature in experimental animals and humans attributing long term consequences for offspring of maternal gestational stress
6285104 they suggest both a sex specificity and a relatively short gestational time window for gestational effects on vulnerability to schizophrenia
6285105 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6285106 when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him

6285113 who doesnt become a killer when someone has a gun to their head
6285114 just so we will gain the experience that we will need once the us will start accepting filipino nurses again
6285115 we know that right now the us is not accepting filipino nurses because of the visa retrogression but then i am still optimistic that after the elections in the us this little obstacle will be lifted and again they will open their doors for us
6285116 it is obvious that more and more of our young people are taking up nursing
6285117 there are those whose heart may not be in the profession but they see it as their way out of poverty even if the us is closing its doors there are alternate destinations for our nurses like the middle east singapore japan and european countries
6285118 i strongly disagree with our government encouraging our people to work abroad it is the responsibility of our government to take care of our graduates we are losing skilled and hard working people
6285119 some of them have to make do with being volunteers receiving no pay or allowance their only consolation is that they would be able to use the certification that they would get from hospitals for possible employment in other countries
6285120 it is the governments responsibility to ensure that our nurses are employed to encourage them to stay and serve the country the government should come up with a good socio economic package that would include non monetary compensations
6285121 the starting pay of our nurses right now on average is at p15 000 331 per month compare that to the salary they will be getting in the us and other countries an average of us 20 per hour this is very small
6285122 we know that right now it seems impossible to get a job in the us but then again it does not mean that we should also stop trying
6285123 all of a sudden secretary atienza transformed himself into a crusader for the environment and called on the world bank wb the asian development bank adb and other funding agencies here and abroad to finance the p100 billion 2 21 billion at the aug 15 exchange rate of 1 p45 31 manila bay rehabilitation plan this is moneymaking at its best
6285124 secretary atienza even mentioned the problem of climate change and global warming indicating that malaca ang and the denr are set to make an ambitious project proposal for manila bay rehabilitation p100 billion is p100 billion and its a huge fortune for the corrupt regime of mrs arroyo
6285125 please allow us to state the real score about manila bay eighty percent of the untreated water wastes that are thrown or dumped into the bay come from industries and commercial establishments situated along the bay the reclamation activities of the government that began during the marcos era up and which continue at present are also destroying manila bay and have prevented the ecosystem and marine life from regenerating
6285126 we are not happy with the way the national government is treating manila bay we are being blamed for its deterioration why us we are not destroyers of natural resources and marine environment we cannot destroy our main source of livelihood it is impossible for us to do that because destroying manila bay is like destroying our basis for existence in fact we are victims here
6285127 from 1992 to 1995 the demolitions of coastal shanties became an everyday ordeal in pasay reclamation area houses were uprooted almost daily small and big time bribery to divide the communities were conducted to facilitate the demolition of coastal communities
6285128 it is being considered by leaders and members of pamalakaya in manila bay we will sit and talk about this legal battle and finalize it maybe not later than this week
6285129 its also good to know the projected return on the governments investment was better than we expected
6285130 its imperative when doing delicate and inspiring projects such as parental advisory and belly 2 that all of the involved parties from the network the film distributors the business partners and of course the artists all share the same level of enthusiasm and excitement for the end product

6285137 intinya performance art diadakan sebagai satir dan sentilan pada berbagai kalangan yang hanya cuek bebek pada tanggal 17 agustus malahan hari yang amat sakral ini digunakan sebagai ajang kesempatan bagi anak muda untuk hal hal tertentu hanya karena beralasan tanggal merah jadi mereka bisa pergi ke mana saja dengan pacarnya dan bagi instansi terkait kami hanya sekedar mengkritisi bahwa proklamasi hari kemerdekaan merupakan simbolik kemerdekaan yang harus kita teruskan
6285138 pada waktu proses penggarapan ruangan itu dinamakan gudang seni rupa dan seni instalasi karena menurut kami proses penggarapan sebuah seni instalasi itu adalah bagian dari sebuah pameran setelah semua karya terkumpul kita pindahkan ke ruangan yang disediakan khusus untuk pameran yang menarik setelah kita melakukan performance peserta performance art langsung masuk ke ruangan pameran kemudian menempati tiap sudut ruangan pameran seolah olah seperti patung karena manusia juga bisa masuk ke dalam seni instalasi sesuai dengan posisi duduk atau berdiri yang memiliki sign atau simbol tersendiri yang mengartikan sebuah apresiasi kemerdekaan
6285139 the only stress you have is the stress you create for yourself
6285140 you have one life to live you wanna waste your time doing what youre doing now
6285141 i dont think in the first half we executed what we came to do very well in the second half i think it got better we moved the ball around better we were disappointed in the no call on fred in the box i cant wait to look at it again but from my memory it was 100 percent a pk and thats a very crucial time to get one back and make it 1 1 we had our chances so its disappointing i felt like we could have snuck out with a tie
6285142 when you go down one its disappointing but i dont think we created a whole lot either so on that side i was disappointed we talked and reorganized the second half and i thought we had a lot of good play and some good quality chances
6285143 i couldnt see it until the last second and it came through devon mctavish s legs i went to kick it and adam cristman got it and i just couldnt get enough on it and it just went right off taylor twellman give them some credit they hustled and were in the right spot it was just bad luck on our part
6285144 we always say that when the defense drops too much on the forwards its always trouble for us in the second half when we started playing and pressing putting more pressure higher it made a big difference in the game we put in a better performance in the second half but still it wasnt good enough thats another lesson and hopefully it wont happen again
6285145 the revolution did a pretty good job keeping the ball and winning second balls we had a big gap in the middle but we sorted it out in the second half and it made a big difference it was a bad loss but now we just have to think about saturday
6285146 we never gave up we kept digging kept trying and after we scored the first goal we had some good chances to tie the game its just part of the game where you get chances and you miss them we just have to do a better job overall it wasnt a good job in the first half but we showed a different team in the second half well learn from it and it wont happen again
6285147 doug warren looked confident he had a couple of things he had to make decisions about and when he had to make decisions he made the right one which is half the battle with goalkeepers it is great they can make fantastic saves but if they can make good decisions on a regular basis it makes it look easier than it actually is
6285148 the first half we felt safe to be ahead we would have liked to have penetrated them a bit more but as far as playing the game was concerned we were in control we were in control up until the 60th minute and then we lost our way a little bit and they put us under pressure we lost a goal from our own bad play we should have just stopped the ball up the other end of the field and cleared it and we didnt we tried to be too clever in the wrong area lost the ball and then jaime moreno scored a great goal if that falls to anybody else it is not a goal it was a fantastic goal from him it was difficult after that all of a sudden theyre one goal in it youre stuck between going forward too early and back too far and that is what happened after they scored
6285149 khano smith has been over the past two or three games he has been lively he has been enthusiastic the one thing that we tend to forget is players coming from outside the usa dont understand the whole travel part of the game and mauricio castro has been just feeling his legs he is used to getting on a bus and going an hour and playing another team he is not used to time zones and flights and buses to stadiums to get to the airport and all kinds of things castro was feeling his legs a little bit but as i said khano smith has been energetic and confident and that is why were playing him
6285150 michael parkhurst has been saying he hasnt gotten a lot of sleep but he has experience behind him now he has a fantastic soccer brain and no surprise that he came through
6285151 taylor twellman just needs games he really just needs to get games under his belt to get his real sharpness he is fit he can run all day but that extra sharpness you get from playing games is what he is missing
6285152 adam cristman has been an absolute trooper he has made a huge contribution the last four or five weeks good strikers are always active anyway and the two of them are good strikers theyre both good at holding the ball up and they can both score goals may it continue
6285153 we have so many games at the present time that were counting the suspensions and the bruises and the injuries as we go along
6285154 to me that game was already gone you couldnt get it back thats a difficult situation to come in at i was just focusing on this game this was my game from the start the guys in front of me played unbelievable michael parkhurst jay heaps and chris albright and just our defending six back there played unbelievable which made it a lot easier on me
6285155 removing the infrastructure bottlenecks is seen as a good business opportunity by the private players the sector is emerging as a potential employment generator with its share set to leap further
6285156 cornering more than two thirds share in the job creation tier i cities generated a total of 8 506 job openings in the infrastructure sector among the tier i cities the financial capital of india mumbai generated the maximum employment opportunities with a share of 29 31 percent
6285157 now the government is using the peace process as an ad lib to push for mrs arroyos term extension
6285158 malaca ang is railroading the cha cha train by riding on senate resolution no 10 introduced by senate minority floor leader aquilino pimentel jr which seeks the creation of 11 federal states in the country mrs arroyo is hell bent on staying in power beyond 2010 so it is not surprising that she will grab every opportunity to justify cha cha ive never seen a president that is so power hungry
6285159 what really makes us furious is that theyve even used the quest for self determination of our muslim brothers and sisters in advancing their selfish interests
6285160 the grp is in no place to claim that they have accepted and re established their recognition of the rights of the bangsamoro we see it as a mere ploy to re introduce charter change
6285161 i love you too you can wear my sweater just dont stain it
6285162 the war may have ended more than half a century ago but for many of the lolas grandmothers wartime is no different from so called peacetime they may have been violated and abused during the war but until now they are being victimized by japans unchanging stance and denial of justice
6285163 it is very unfortunate that while other countries are backing the fight of the lolas our very own government is caught with nary an observance of its responsibility to exercise political will in urging the japanese government to finally recognize the violations it committed during world war ii ww2
6285164 the arroyo government has misplaced priorities on when and where to flex its political muscle there is already a draft resolution filed in the lower house calling for the japanese government to formally apologize and accept responsibility over the comfort women case but this has been shelved since april
6285165 it is utterly vile that instead of pushing congress to immediately pass the resolution the arroyo administration would rather train its dogs on how to secure benefits for arroyos own selfish interests by pushing for charter change
6285166 the militarys culture of sexism and violence that victimized the lolas continues to this day women are especially vulnerable to abuse during times of actual war and even with the mere presence of the military
6285167 like in the case of the lolas the philippine government also wavers in its stance to seek justice for hazel
6285168 by continuing to turn a blind eye to the violence committed against its women by foreign troops whether recent or in the past and by perpetuating its culture of subservience to foreign superpowers such as japan and the us the philippine government serves as an accomplice to the sexual abuse of filipinas everywhere
6285169 i was always running around and on the bars and thats kind of how i started
6285170 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6285171 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year
6285172 we havent seen those prices reflected in the finished products yet
6285173 it is exceptional the degree to which the militarys currently relying on such contractors
6285174 were of a much smaller scale than what we are seeing in iraq
6285175 weve spent so many resources and so much attention on iraq that weve lost sight of future threats down the road the current conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example
6285176 the debate has got to shift as a result of this war
6285177 we gotta have more cash for weapons the russians are coming
6285178 the completion of this lease certainly demonstrates neiman marcus long term vision for walnut creek
6285179 we believe the neiman marcus customer is already shopping in walnut creek and at broadway plaza
6285180 this market and the unique setting weve found in broadway plaza come together as a great match for neiman marcus and we hope well add to what is a very vibrant retail district
6285181 this newest store in the macerich portfolio continues to solidify our reputation for locating neiman marcus at strong and growing retail properties that appeal to our target customer
6285182 with a new administration on the horizon many of us are hoping things will change for the better

6285190 the coup detat appears to have failed and admiral tomas where abouts is at present unknown
6285191 well at all events i m still here i don t like it very much but how are you
6285192 o thou who lovest me set this love in order
6285193 i made sure they will be able to enter but i fear i have revealed our presence to isaac
6285194 we know what youre after and we know what you are too long have you made others suffer and today we end this
6285195 we ran into a bit of trouble with the welcoming committee
6285196 prince isaac i suppose you should know that your general was captured by our troops his men have been routed and those who were able to break through our lines are now fleeing from the area i suggest you lay down your arms and surrender so that you may answer for your crimes
6285197 i would have died if it wasnt for my wife
6285198 you almost did what so many others couldnt rove but i cant let you continue down this path youve abused your position as an angel and youll be banished to hell if youre caught the robyne i remember deserves to have a happy afterlife but if thats not an option i still cant let your soul endure that kind of pain
6285199 you expect me to believe that even now you would destroy me
6285200 i would much rather sit down and talk this out
6285201 you didnt seem so eager to talk back on the day you killed my one true love
6285202 no one as corrupt as you should have that power
6285203 and who should have it you queen of the shadow clan what about our self styled rulers power exists to be used
6285204 very well i see i will just have to show you how weak those qualities really are
6285205 this is what isaac is after this place will allow him to control the currents of the world
6285206 there was once a time when you loved me more than anyone and ive always loved you
6285207 i can only begin to understand the pain you went through losing the one you loved i experienced that loss once too though not to death but being with sweetseve these past few days has made me realize that ive been given a second chance actually ive been given second chances most of my life because i always seem to screw them up the first time around back when were children i was so angry we were part of a family that didnt want us our peers were willing to play with us but were kept at arms length by the rest of our village had i known you were able to break through those barriers with mallord had i known that you two were in love i would have still killed him
6285208 even though i knew the consequences i just couldnt stop myself i was selfish i only cared about my own pride and my own anger and even though i loved you i never once asked for your views i assumed that my beliefs were yours that was perhaps my greatest mistake
6285209 it wasnt until i came here to the valley that i truly learned what it meant to be in a loving family krow lili aurel duke ely ivory dawn crystal and sweets they were more of a family to me than wren ever let me have it made me realize the wrongs i had done people in my life if you had been alive i would have sought you out i would have thrown myself at your mercy i owed you that much at least
6285210 your friend killed me and everyone else in the village except for sparrow who ran and hid
6285211 and i killed kane when i found out what he did
6285212 and when he came back for my soul it was yet another highlight of a failure in my life i resolved that i could at least change this one and worked toward redeeming kane and giving him the chance at a new life he taught me forgiveness i cant ask for the same from you robyne only you can decide if thats what you want i remember you as a kind pure hearted soul and it causes me more pain than you can even imagine seeing you swallowed by hatred like this i deserve anything i have coming for the things ive done but you shouldnt have to suffer because of my failures
6285213 so i leave it in your hands rove you can kill me and damn yourself for all eternity or you can forgive and be the robyne you were meant to be
6285214 your words ravene you always did have a silver tongue
6285215 i want to forgive but i cant it was so clear to me before but now that i have you here i dont want revenge i dont want forgiveness i just dont want to hurt anymore
6285216 robyne we were both always hotheads i guess you never got the chance to grow up
6285217 peric and crystal have kingdoms to rebuild and ivory will help them
6285218 you have lost your highness your army is defeated and your purpose for being here is gone yield
6285219 i dont think even you have the patience to wait that long prince
6285220 well perics been stabbed in the shoulder i may have a concussion isaacs upset because he has to wait four hundred years for another opportunity like this and we think rage might be dead
6285221 you know you could have warned us before you did that
6285222 the soulcenter has absorbed the spirit of my sister robyne wolvenfoxe
6285223 neither isaac nor isaiah will trouble this land any longer
6285224 general this is my second cousin ravene wolvenfoxe and his wife queen sweetseve of the shadow clan
6285225 i hear you can transform much like king peric can
6285226 robyne and i are twins two manifestations of the same person but she lost her ability to transform when she died she needed that part of me to become one with the soulcenter
6285227 i guess out of everything that has happened between us i figured that sparrow and i would live forever always canceling each other out but he died in the wake of a misunderstanding between his two half siblings even after all hes done to try and kill me i dont think he deserved that there was a time when sparrow was a hero when he did things other than selfishly even if thats the way he ended up he proved that he could be a kind being if he had gone that way i have to admit i was proud of him these last few days he knew the threat that isaac presented and he acted on it we would not have gotten through decadeus castle without him and for that i will always be grateful sparrow we may have made better enemies than friends but i will miss you and kane as well those of us living will do our best to honor your memories so heres to the heroes of the valley who are no longer with us
6285228 and wherever you are now sparrow i hope youre able to forgive me and robyne

6285230 there has been much damage done to our kingdoms rav the anthromorphs and my people are too weak to stand on our own but together we might build a new kingdom where different races can learn to live together without our petty differences getting in the way when i was princess i had many suitors vying for my hand who would have taken over the rule and made me their consort but i know peric will embrace our different opinions and we will rule together
6285231 weve been thinking of a name for this new kingdom we were leaning toward ravenia

6285250 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent

6285252 this is not just about missile defense this is about demonstrating to russia that america is still a nation of resolve and were not going to let russian expansionism intimidate everyone
6285253 the president was informed immediately on friday when we received news of the first two ss 21 russian missile launchers into georgian territory
6285254 i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
6285255 if the government isnt willing to talk to people then the people need to be willing to talk to each other
6285256 it comes from a belief in the nature of security its not about weapons fear and posturing on the world stage its about communication talking to people everyone having their basic needs met if you understood security that way youd see that security is about dialogue
6285257 sometimes i have so much sex to try to calm myself down i get bored of it and men i sleep with dont seem to make as much effort because i climax so easily
6285258 within a few weeks i just began to get more and more aroused more and more of the time and i just kept having endless orgasms it started off in bed where sex sessions would last for hours and my boyfriend would be stunned at how many times i would orgasm then it would happen after sex id be thinking about what wed done in bed and id start feeling a bit flushed then id become aroused and climax in six months i was having 150 orgasms a day and it has been as many as 200

6285270 we continue to think the disappointments are a product of under investment
6285271 commodity costs have been volatile over the last several years and continue to remain at levels that are well above historical averages
6285272 consumers are likely to see higher every day and promotional retail prices as we implement the price increase and as a result we expect volume in the fourth quarter and next year to be lower than previously estimated
6285273 therefore we continue to expect that earnings per share diluted from operations in 2009 will increase however at a rate below our long term objective of 6 to 8 growth
6285274 this is really the key stat that helped make the decision very easy for us

6285276 if you go to the retail stores you probably see that the amount of shelf space that they give to packaged software has declined but its still one of our best channels the place that we get most of our new customers and were still excited about it

6285305 it will take sometime before masses who now use cisco traditional distributed aps move onto the bandwagon although the direction of wi fi provisioning administration and rf management is toward centralization

6285307 wlan adopters are clearly committed to the technology as evidenced by their plans to deploy to more end users and to add functionality but what about the suppliers will the areas that need improvement be addressed there is plenty of reason to conclude that the answer is yes products from wireless specialist companies like reefedge and trapeze networks are aimed at helping enterprises design and manage increasingly complex wlan deployments while industry leaders like cisco and 3com continue to introduce enhancements to their products since so many industry players see wireless as one of the few shining spots in the industry you can be certain that r amp d investments will continue

6285316 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6285317 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them

6285329 como dije no voy a entrar en eso tengo mis repeticiones aqu y s lo intento aprovecharlas al m ximo no estoy seguro de la estrategia en el piso de arriba pero como dije todas esas repeticiones que reciba tratar de prepararme para ello es una semana corta me preparo para enfrentar a chicago
6285330 no pienso en eso ahora cuando suceda lidiar con ello es parte del juego tambi n ahora s lo me enfoco en lo que debo hacer el jueves por la noche

6285338 as a kid i was always drawing i loved to draw cartoons especially and comics when i was at primary school i drew my first comic which turned into a series and a long story intricately entwined with sub plots and different characters by the time i went to university id all but stopped drawing taking accountancy because thats where the jobs were today i guess im still drawing comics in a way i look for the sub plots in the accounts whats the other story behind the main one and thats how i teach my staff look for the sub plots it makes auditing a whole lot more fun
6285339 calculus was easy everyone else thought it was really difficult and stupid but i found it easy id get a thrill from finding the right answer its obvious to me now my recipes are just a form of calculus you take indgredients a and b and turn them into x i dont think ill tell my chefs that they might think im a nerd and not the great artiste
6285340 i first acted in a play at kindergarten i was a tree but i was the best tree ever my parents adored my acting always encouraging me in fact they wanted me to continue through drama school and everything i think they thought i would be a movie star i did try for a while when i went to university but i never had any money after uni i joined a local drama club met my wife and we soon had our first child so i left the acting world and joined a local bank great prospects regular wages and a subsidised mortgage i suppose that a coo is rather like a director in a play making sure that the right people are in the right place at the right time with the right script brilliant
6285341 i was always the joker of the family no matter what happened i had to make a joke out of it my brother bore the brunt of most of my wilder practical jokes and some of them werent really funny at all still it was fun it got me in a lot of trouble at school in the end i quit school and worked on a market stall i worked for this really sour faced bloke selling vegetables blimey he was miserable he hated my joking with the customers but they loved it and kept coming back so he didnt stop me im still a joker i like a laugh and i like to keep the guys happy i suppose being the centre of attention does something for me thats why i set this up the company being the centre of everyones attention and we make money i always say if you cant have a laugh while your living life then life will laugh at you

6285355 weve seen middle class families hit hard economically the american dream is slipping away for many one of the biggest challenges we face is how we move forward on energy
6285356 the energy policy weve had for the last four years we dont even know what it is
6285357 the policy looks like bush travels to saudi arabia with hat in hand to get them to turn the spigot back on thats not going to work
6285358 do more with less thats what were asking people to do

6285365 hal yang masih saya sembunyikan dari pacar hingga sekarang adalah besarnya jumlah salary saya karena saya tahu gaji dia lebih besar dari saya kalau dia sampai tahu malu dong saya
6285366 dulu saya bersama tiga orang teman bertaruh untuk merebut hati seorang perempuan dan menikahinya dan alhamdulillah sayalah yang berhasil memperistrinya tapi sampai sekarang saya tak pernah menceritakan hal ini pada istri bisa bisa nanti dia marah besar yang penting saya benar benar mencintainya kok
6285367 saya mencium sahabatnya kebetulan kalau ada masalah dengan pacar saya sering curhat kepada sahabatnya suatu waktu ketika sedang bertengkar hebat saya pergi ke rumah sahabatnya untuk sharing masalah melihat dia yang sabar mendengar cerita saya tiba tiba saja saya ingin menciumnya bagaimanapun itu tindakan salah saya sangat menyesal dan sangat tak ingin ia tahu
6285368 saya dan pacar sebenarnya berbeda agama tapi sejak awal saya tak pernah mengatakan padanya bila keyakinan kami berbeda saya sangat mencintainya dan takut kalau harus kehilangan dirinya
6285369 ibu saya tipe yang perfeksionis termasuk saat menilai calon istri saya namun sebagai orang jawa beliau sangat pintar berbasa basi selama ini pacar mengira ibu saya bisa menerimanya padahal sebenarnya ibu tak suka padanya saya benar benar tidak tahu bagaimana harus mengatakan ini pada pacar saya takut melukai hatinya
6285370 saat ini saya sedang menjalin hubungan dengan 3 perempuan sah sah saja kan kalau saya ingin menyeleksi mana yang terbaik untuk dijadikan pendamping hidup yang pasti saya tak pernah mengatakan kepada mereka kalau mereka bukanlah satu satunya perempuan dalam hidup saya
6285371 meskipun sudah menikah terkadang saya masih berkomunikasi dengan salah satu mantan pacar sekadar chatting atau bahkan ngobrol di coffee shop sebenarnya hubungan kami murni pertemanan kok tapi karena istri saya cemburuan membuat saya tak berani cerita padanya

6285377 it was just horrible for me just thinking about what her last minutes were how her last hour was that was really hard
6285378 i just want the word to get out into the community that we have to come together as a cohesive unit it doesnt take one person it takes a community of people to work together
6285379 i think one very fine way to tell the development of a society is how it treats its poets its gay people and its women
6285380 and in those three areas we really are backward i believe that two generations from today there may be value placed on all of this young people today read poetry they buy books they read poetry on the internet the internet has taken poetry out of that academic conversation which has to happen if poetrys going to live say poetry and there were a lot of people who were turned off already who had forgotten that a poetry reading is just a man or a woman speaking to you poetry needs to resonate with you if its going to live its human speech and its the most beautiful speech its elevated in a way we cant have in our normal lives it contains the best of us

6285383 this is a case that illustrates everything that is wrong with the death penalty in texas
6285384 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6285385 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6285386 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6285387 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6285388 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6285389 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6285390 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6285391 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6285392 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6285393 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6285394 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6285395 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6285396 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6285397 we want to be on location there are many questions
6285398 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6285399 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6285400 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6285401 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away
6285402 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6285403 when i started as a carer i knew it was a hard job but i had no idea that at the end of it i would feel this upset now im absolutely terrified of getting old
6285404 im feeling good up there but its not something you want to talk too much about it
6285405 no dialogue on the kyoto protocol whatsoever this time the members of the kyoto protocol are invited to discuss so from that point of view there is some improvement
6285406 but on the other hand i think it has more to do with the domestic politics because you have election
6285407 i want to stress that the united states takes climate change very seriously for we are both a major economy and a major emitter

6285649 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans
6285650 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do

6285686 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation anytime that happens its great
6285687 thats huge anytime you can get that kind of run support early in the game it kind of takes pressure off you
6285688 you dont have to be as perfect you have a little cushion and it allows you to relax

6285701 at this moment thaksins legal team is proceeding to ask for political asylum for thaksin and his family in britain
6285702 if thaksins request is met it will set terrible precedents for other rich powerful and non democratic figures in thailand as well as elsewhere to follow suit

6285704 on behalf of everyone at the human rights campaign i want to express deep sadness at the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones
6285705 the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community has not just lost an ally but a friend representative tubbs jones could always be counted on to speak out for civil rights and was an outspoken advocate for lgbt equality she will be greatly missed
6285706 we see a lot more value in meditation than in massages or wellness packs when meditating youre active which is the opposite of most other wellness applications
6285707 yoga is not only about moving the body but is also a form of self recognition that integrates breathing and body awareness with the intellect or spirit of the body
6285708 in yoga we train the physical condition for meditation through asanas which is a yoga body position
6285709 in the end the point is to let everything go
6285710 meditation is something that when starting out you just have to get used to but its not something you should feel forced to do its counterproductive to do it with iron discipline for two hours a day
6285711 i can understand the essence of life within two minutes or i can take 20 years or more and still not understand
6285712 we probably have three times the coffee in ours that they do
6285713 i think its clear to say that over the past few years certainly in the research we have done the whole movement is from alcoholic beverages and fast food to cafes
6285714 out of all the sites that starbucks has got there are only one or two that are making any money
6285715 starbucks serves up fairly indifferent coffee but at least you know what youre getting
6285716 australia with its history of european immigration was always going to be a test
6285717 starbucks has trying to sell a watered down product in one of the most sophisticated and lively coffee markets in the world
6285718 the customer will be certain that the person behind the machine knows exactly what they are doing
6285719 no more than one denim article should be worn at a time
6285720 or at least the cloth should be confined to one part of the body
6285721 an all denim outfit always seems rather coarse it awakens associations of cowboys and construction workers

6285723 artists only get 10 of the money anyway and the labels spend money on fancy offices at fancy locations and drive around in expensive cars
6285724 wait a second youve been stealing from the artists for years now you want me to stand up for you
6285725 take only as much as you would like to eat
6285726 its a little bit like a trunk even if youre moving to another city you can take everything you own with you without changing any of it around
6285727 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county
6285728 some areas could see rainfall of as much as 30 inches
6285729 some people wont be able to get out of their houses until the water recedes
6285730 who the hell takes the third game of the preseason like its goddamn bullshit
6285731 wed played them in preseason steaming who in the hell takes the third game in preseason like its bullshit bullshit we played them in the third game everybody played 3 quarters the bears are who we thought they were
6285732 this here is one of the reasons we moved to this area

6285741 in the ideal world if we had a better safety net out there four out of 10 patients could go elsewhere
6285742 not only are we seeing medi cal patients but patients with hmo insurance who cant get in to see their regular doctor for whatever reason
6285743 particularly for medi cal patients long appointment wait times and fewer available providers discourage patients from seeing nonemergency department providers
6285744 for those on medi cal their visit could have been avoided if the patient had timely and effective primary care
6285745 we do see more medi cal patients because so many people have lost their jobs in this economy
6285746 they no longer can afford to visit their primary care physicians and so they come to the emergency department as their first visit to the doctor
6285747 that is putting a tremendous burden on all the valley hospitals and the medical staffs to meet the volume of need
6285748 if youre a medi cal patient your options are strictly limited
6285749 if you look at the rate of which of medi cal programs pay the rates are the lowest in 50 states
6285750 obviously we are concerned and want to find primary doctors so they dont have to use the emergency room inappropriately
6285751 if we dont reenact the draft i dont think mccain doesnt disagree with question about reinstituting the draft born to serve once again the demowienies are in the process what late veep pick
6285752 additionally we will also have a 3g solution in this timeframe
6285753 all of these netbooks are wonderful when we envisioned the netbook we thought it was going to be predominantly for emerging markets
6285754 but we are surprised happily surprised to see that this technology is also being desired in mature markets

6285778 has not been determined as of yet but it is known that they suffered from extensive water smoke and heat damage
6285779 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis
6285780 it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that
6285781 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis

6285793 you cant do it when youre running around the tan running track in the middle of winter in melbourne you can do it when you get an opportunity to play cricket being across in india is the right place to do it
6285794 i know that players who have played a decade of first class cricket and also other options playing overseas and things like that do get worn out
6285795 i plan to not hang around just for one or two years i plan to prepare myself for beyond that i think ive got a bit of longevity i dont think its a short term fix i think it could be a long term option as well
6285796 it probably indicates that it still is open in terms of selection i guess that goes for every position its a new look australian group and a new tier coming up behind the existing team so im just really excited to be a part of that

6285893 it seems to me that the real political task in a society such as ours is to criticize the working of the institutions which appear to be both neutral and independent to criticize them in such a way that the political violence which has always exercised itself obscurely through them will be unmasked so that we can fight them

6285914 we are just hyper aware of a whole bunch of things as adults that children arent i watch my grandchildren each activity consumes them while theyre doing their activities im thinking about six other things so we just view the world so differently
6285915 youre constantly asking yourself how many more things can i accomplish before my time is up each moment becomes a little more precious
6285916 when i look at my grandchildren and remember when i was their age a grownup was 18 years old now an 18 year old is a child
6285917 if we could really extrapolate this concept and sort of make each day precious because we prize them more because they appear to be fewer we would lead more meaningful lives

6285942 well thank you for this honorable mention mr paste its been quite a year and this has really capped it off or as we say here in britain put the turkey on the christmas table and what a turkey what a christmas table you might think the two are synonymous but without a turkey a christmas table is nothing you have given me that turkey
6285943 i guess i cant say i was surprised when i got the news after several chart topping hits and selling thousands of records in manchester orchestra i figured it was just a matter of time before this project skyrocketed straight to the top as well but sincerely thank you paste for all you do for me and my friends
6285944 theyre in my sleep my dreams my midnights my mornings and afternoons my weekends my errands songs theyre now in the world and no longer contained in the privacy of my living room i feel a sense of responsibility with that dont wanna waste peoples time what used to be written strictly for me is now meant for others and thats not a cop out im grateful for your attention and time
6285945 i kindly thank you folks for thinking i am promising and all but how did you find me i have been hiding out in the cool waters of the emerald river tucked away in the pines far away from the lands where magazines are written you must have a little spy that rides a trout or something
6285946 were less the next big thing and more like the last old thing in fact we are like sooooo 2006 its ridiculous we are much like a pair of well worn pink cycling shorts pretty cool to like if you are 11 but just a passing fancy before you move on to more fashionable tastes

6285962 people tend to purchase whats most suitable for them from what they can find this creates problems because contractors do not have insurance like estate agents do
6285963 they do not have a mechanism of punishment in case of acts of fraud the mortgage law will give people more choice because they will not be limited by the amount of money they have
6285964 with the mortgage legislation they will be able to purchase properties which cost 100 000 or 150 000 these houses will be completed ones and the buyer will be able to move into a fully completed house without facing any problems
6285965 it will definitely be lower than the interest rates of the banks both for ytl and for foreign currencies
6285966 we want to thank the entire metal blade staff especially

6285976 you think you can win by taking the higher ground i worry about you
6285977 im skinny but im tough we will hit back with the truth
6285978 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6285979 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6285980 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6285981 but we have found with joint powers authorities its much less stable than a pure authority
6285982 i think theyre a long way from getting other groups to participate
6285983 i want as many eyes on financial matters as possible
6285984 its the closest thing to hell ive seen everything was burning there was nothing left that resembled a plane it was in pieces its a miracle anyone survived
6285985 i was on the runway and i could see the cloud of smoke
6285986 the whole field erupted in flames over an area of about one kilometre square the rescue workers couldnt get to the plane because of the fire engulfing the whole fuselage
6285987 this was a fairly elderly aircraft but saying that there are many of them flying
6285988 ive been trying to phone them but they just dont answer i just dont know if they were on it
6285989 they were very dear friends and they would have put into effect immediately the full emergency evacuation system if they were in a position to do so
6285990 at first i thought it was just landing but then i saw that it abruptly change direction to the right and the wing seemed to hit the ground it seemed to break apart with a large explosion
6285991 i saw it take off and it climbed to about 200 metres when flames appeared in the engine it then crashed to the ground and disappeared in a hollow past the end of the runway
6285992 we extend deep condolences to the families and friends of those lost in the crash we stand ready to provide technical assistance
6285993 the first half was very good we got to grips with the game in the first 15 minutes but i really thought that the 30 minutes before half time was very good we played some good football and held control of the ball very well
6285994 but i think the conditions in the second half completely ruined the game we were in control of the game and could have scored a couple more
6285995 unfortunately we dont want to concede any goals to any team well remember the first half and try to completely forget the second half looking at the team today it should stand us in good stead for the next few weeks
6285996 with the players we have were capable of playing like that next month its the way the players want to play if we can play like that in the next two games were capable of getting something out of them
6285997 kami merasa kami lain dengan band mana pun kami punya materi yang cukup untuk bertarung kami sangat optimis dengan musik yang kami buat kalau soal bagaimana nanti kami semua tergantung publik dan tergantung manajemen langit kami hanya berusaha menyuguhkan yang terbaik dari kami
6285998 we are a revolutionary organization we will never turn over our men to them we have our own internal justice they will stand trial with us if they commit any offense

6286016 by becoming the first ever software as a service company to achieve an annualized revenue run rate of one billion dollars our second quarter performance is a milestone for salesforce
6286017 said chairman and chief executive marc benioff in a prepared statement
6286018 our largest customers are increasingly becoming the best examples of what is possible using the power of our growing portfolio of software as a service applications and our emerging platform as a service
6286019 java is under no serious threat from php ruby or c
6286020 especially since c has severely erroded javas control of the enterprise
6286021 the basic facts of java are good points 1 easy to use 2 useful in rtc 3 loved by corporate people who like the idea of cross platform idea but this itself is just like anyother language 4 good set of library functions bad points 1 memory hog 2 slow slow slow 3 overkill for most functions and applications 4 over rated
6286022 they dont do computational 3d they dont do complex numerics they dont do gui design
6286023 but they are scripting languages and get their power through specialization they just generate web pages
6286024 any discussion about java versus php or ruby or any other language is in many ways moot anyway gosling also stressed
6286025 its a mystery to me why the japanese police would target three relatively minor crewmembers
6286026 as captain all sea shepherd crewmembers act in accordance with my orders all activities opposing the illegal actions of the japanese whaling fleet are my responsibility yet no charges have been filed against me this is absurd and makes no sense at all
6286027 the arrest warrants against these three men will have absolutely no impact on the campaign
6286028 we will return to the southern ocean whale sanctuary and we will resume our campaign of intervention against the illegal activities of the japanese whaling fleet we will not be deterred we will not retreat and we will never surrender the lives of these defenseless whales to the outlaw whalers from japan
6286029 in december this ridiculous rhetoric will be set aside as we go head to head with the whale killers with new tactics new strategies and with two ships against the pirate whale killing fleet the whalers are getting desperate
6286030 the sea shepherd conservation society is not protesting whaling we are opposing illegal whaling in accordance with the principles of the united nation world charter for nature if our activities are illegal then the warrant would be addressed to me not to three non officer volunteers
6286031 im feeling good up there but its not something you want to talk too much about it
6286032 it is the spectacle of people who might be different thats all it is
6286033 the tourists appear to have little regard for the neighborhood and its residents and view the stop as akin to visiting a zoo or other attraction where they are entertained by exhibits or animals
6286034 if i had my little way id eat peaches everyday
6286035 there was a fear that the catholic world in latin america and in asia would go communist to counteract this there came into being a new theology called the liberation theology especially among the catholics in latin america liberation theology sought solutions in social problems through marxist related ideals but at the same time refraining from subscribing to marxist ideology liberation theology got an impetus from the vatican council ii
6286036 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then can peace come
6286037 im sorry sir but wherever i go theres always a tree in front of me and i cant seem to get away from it
6286038 why did no one run over to help him in an emergency maybe his life could have been saved
6286039 peoples lives are being lost but sometimes i wonder if anyone cares if another mexican immigrant dies
6286040 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6286041 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6286042 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6286043 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6286044 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6286045 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6286046 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6286047 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6286048 i completely understand that cal osha is overworked and understaffed but whats offensive is that the agency is reducing fines with no justification
6286049 in some cases companies are paying pennies on the dollar from the original fine imposed
6286050 sharks have shaped evolution in our oceans for 450 million years and their diminishment has already been the cause of severe damage to global oceanic eco systems shark species extinctions will cause irreparable damage
6286051 if we cant save the sharks we will fail to save our oceans and if our oceans die civilization and humanity will die lush and sea shepherd recognize that we need to save the sharks if we are to save ourselves and we are working together to make this happen
6286052 lush are a campaigning company and we have already tackled issues such as animal testing and over packaging but with 100 million sharks being killed every year and time fast running out for the remaining 10 of the global shark population the campaign against shark finning and longlining is perhaps our biggest challenge yet
6286053 lush have over 550 stores in more than 50 countries and we will be campaigning on this issue in all of them but the nature of the global campaign very much depends on the decision made by the dpi amp f in australia next month if it goes against the sharks we know who the target of our campaign will be
6286054 were likely to get a much grimmer view of the construction industry than persimmon warned us about just a month ago
6286055 this comes against the background of the uks biggest mortgage lender halifax telling us that the value of our homes has slumped by more than 10 over the last year
6286056 unhealthy people will purposely go for the ones who are weaker than they are even when they know that they too are weak they believe in weaker and weakest the brave will throw caution to the wind and risk what they fear the most the person completely opposite of who they are ah yes our imago match its an opportunity to learn about ourselves and most importantly to mend our injuries may we learn so that we may assist in healing others with unconditional support and love without expectations of compensation id rather be brave
6286057 i think i need to tie this in a double knot so no one will untie it
6286058 i cant wear a bra with this thing no camisole nothing

6286063 yeah you better sit up straight tonight or those things are going to fall out
6286064 i guess i really didnt notice this when i was trying on the dress
6286065 youll be fine youve got enough there to keep that dress up maybe just tie that a little tighter on top no double knots
6286066 double knot small embarrassment halter top falling off large embarrassment ah what the ladies do to look pretty i stuck with the single small bow
6286067 where are you were in room got a drink chillin for you
6286068 it would be interesting to see a more thorough examination performed
6286069 john had been a councillor for 30 years and seven months from may 1977 to october 2007 being the third longest serving councillor
6286070 we started planning this back in june when the whole place was drier than a methodist picnic with little prospect of rain at all
6286071 no sooner had we printed the posters than the heavens opened and the much needed rain brought a bit of a spring back to many peoples step
6286072 the aim of the night is to provide entertainment to as broad an age range as possible
6286073 it is certainly not just a night for the youngsters
6286074 there will be some seating at tables as well as an open space for dancing or just standing and cheering
6286075 these guys chase holland and michael wahlsten on guitar and vocals tim crogan on drums and shane lapworth on bass guitar are rapidly becoming a polished act and are developing a fan base of their own
6286076 they will be followed by the club band mmc inc featuring dave attard on bass steve elliott on guitar and vocals dennis heffernan on drums reg langford on guitar and vocals and myself on guitar
6286077 mmc inc will be joined for the second half of their set by merredins rising singing star rebecca siddons whose clear melodic singing voice is reminiscent of a 21st century joan baez
6286078 sort of cool to represent us because were a small school not a lot of people from our school get to go out and represent us this is buffalo high school we do have good kids here
6286079 i just couldnt hardly take it i thought i was going to have a nervous breakdown i wouldnt have minded if they would have come back and finished not mind paying but they never showed up
6286080 it takes a lot out we had it in savings if anything happened emergencies come up now its not there
6286081 if someone just shows up at your door wanting to do this get some information from them call me and well check
6286082 the kind of people that would scam older folks like that theres a special place for those people
6286083 all that means is the treasury money is being used for these loans its guaranteed by the banks the state is not at risk of loosing that fund it just makes the funding available to the banks the banks process the loan applications they make the loans
6286084 weve gotten our financial house in order were paying attention were watching very closely were creating jobs and reducing taxes thats pretty exciting i think tuesday night is about the economy so we fit right in
6286085 for a child whos never seen that before whos never felt the lights go down whos never seen the stage lights come up it can be a life changing experience and i would urge you in the face of the fact the budget needs to be cut and gas prices have gone up that you cant put a price on magic
6286086 if my people who are called by my name would humble themselves seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven forgive their sins and heal their land
6286087 demain dimanche ce sera ta derni re chance dy aller ce sera la finale
6286088 faites le tour ici cest plein vous aurez vous faire fouiller votre sac
6286089 even if the sheriffs office would not have hired plaintiff in the first place plaintiff was entitled during the period of time when he was employed to be protected from discrimination and to serve in a workplace free from the hostility that he endured
6286090 cannot confirm the reduction of pharmaceuticals in water with carbon filters
6286091 what you see in many states is a reaction to the lack of action at the federal level
6286092 a lot of bottled water is actually tap water so there is no assurance that what is coming from the bottle is any safer than what is coming from the tap
6286093 this should never have happened to him this is outright bigoted he just got hammered by these guys
6286094 he submitted a 13 page single spaced typed memo of the torture he got put through by these guys
6286095 he sent it to his supervisor and the supervisor said it was horrible and went to the upper boss the upper boss said he sat down with the two guys that were tormenting him and they just agreed to be nicer and that was the extent of what they did
6286096 what it did was it scared the living crap out of the rest of the officers
6286097 what they put this guy through nobody should have to go through
6286098 they basically treated the guy like a leper and made his life a living hell and of course here he is wondering god forbid if he gets shot or gets stabbed and hes bleeding will any of his compatriots come by to help him
6286099 workers want to remember that theyre very often protected by both the federal law the americans with disabilities act and also by state laws
6286100 for example in the state of california the state disability law lists conditions which are presumptively disabilities
6286101 it means a lot of different things in different contexts
6286102 we have 50 offices around the country and there are investigators in all of them
6286103 its important for people to understand that even if the investigator discourages them from filing a charge if they believe they want to pursue this in court they have to file a charge the charge will be taken even if the investigator personally thinks that it may not be a strong case
6286104 we will try to do that in most cases if the company is willing also by using a mediator
6286105 if the case seems to be a very very strong case to us if it looks like there is a patent law violation we really discourage mediation because we want to get to the bottom of that we want the company to have a chance to explain why they took the action they did
6286106 i think the purpose of the ada is certainly being ignored
6286107 i am not sure given recent interpretations of the ada by federal courts that most people with hepatitis c would have protection under the ada its very concerning to me
6286108 i think court decisions have weakened peoples rights under the ada
6286109 the supreme courts first decision about what a disability is under the ada was a case involving a person with asymptomatic hiv disease and the court there said that it was a disability even though there were no significant current symptoms but ever since that decision the supreme courts decisions have been narrowing the definition of disability
6286110 i started working on ada cases at the department of justice when it was a new statute
6286111 we were kind of creating the law under the statute with the early litigation
6286112 at that point they said it wasnt safe for him to work there because there are chemicals in the atmosphere
6286113 what the court said was no that if there is a significant risk of harm to him the employer can refuse to hire him into this position but then the case went back down to the lower courts on the question of whether it was in fact safe and the 9th circuit said that the evidence was sufficient to show that it was safe for him to work at the oil refinery
6286114 the statistics on the success of ada claims in employment are really sobering
6286115 plaintiffs who sue under the ada in the employment context are less successful than any other class of litigants in the federal courts except one and thats prisoners who sue to challenge their conditions of confinement
6286116 there have been a ton of cases in both the supreme court and in the lower federal courts about what constitutes a disability for purposes of the ada
6286117 the courts have tended to be very parsimonious in reading the ada disability definition in particular if an individuals condition can be controlled by medication if the symptoms can be controlled its significantly less likely that that condition will be held to be a disability
6286118 in that atmosphere some people with hepatitis will be able to successfully prove that they have a disability but not all will
6286119 in states like california massachusetts and new york the state anti discrimination laws protect people with chronic illness against discrimination more broadly than does the ada
6286120 theres a bill pending in congress thats sponsored by some of the folks who sponsored the original ada that would overturn a lot of these judicial decisions
6286121 overall the trend is very much in a direction that supporters of the original ada wouldnt have envisioned
6286122 it is a much better way ecologically in terms of climate change instead of eating land animals particularly when you consider animal husbandry
6286123 i say this because i believe that pelagic whaling does not contribute to the prevention of global warming just think of the expensive fuel the japanese whaling fleet consumes en route to the antarctic plus that consumed by the freezing ship for transporting the byproducts of whaling to the japanese market over the years japanese research ships have made a mess on the ocean when fire broke out due to poor management of the vessel add to that the mess made by animal rights groups eager to attack the whaling ships whaling as a business hardly justifies the environmental costs talk about food mileage has not touched on whale meat why doesnt the government consider it more seriously and cease whaling in any form except small scale coastal whaling
6286124 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us
6286125 the quality density is just as good as the top competitors
6286126 but having less research space and thus less research than some of the other top schools limits the impact of our science programs
6286127 the rate limiting factor here is space not ideas or money
6286128 great potential to lift yale science to the very top rank
6286129 it was important for the region to attract another pharmaceutical firm
6286130 with our long standing plans for contributing to a region with a strong science based economy
6286131 you could easily value the property at six or seven times what we paid for it in terms of its replacement cost
6286132 this has transformative potential frankly only some of which we can envision today
6286133 weve given our successors an opportunity to dream in ways we cant imagine today
6286134 if we dont seize this opportunity and transform yale we will have failed
6286135 we need to guard against allowing the campus to become a spillover space for existing programs
6286136 this allows us to think about new structures and new forms of science appropriate for the 21st century
6286137 the west campus will raise the visibility and impact of yale science it will not be an extension of existing yale activities but will represent something distinctly different in organization and the way activities are planned
6286138 this is an opportunity to grow a lot more but also an opportunity to focus on cutting edge areas
6286139 to pursue new ideas while working in a collaborative environment our modest size and strong financial position allow us to move quickly to exploit scientific opportunities
6286140 a spectacular faculty member who will then recruit three to five other scientists for his or her institute
6286141 is to attract exceptional investigators from the start if theyre weak the value of the real estate goes way down
6286142 eventually we will need new computing space on the west campus for high performance scientific computation as we are running out of space on the main campus
6286143 it would make the campus special if activities there include the arts
6286144 it looks like suburban office parks youd find in any of the 50 states
6286145 to think about ways to give the west campus a yale feel
6286146 that the west campus be fully integrated into the core university there have to be many faculty going back and forth
6286147 we populated the west well need a few brave pioneers to populate the wilderness when they see the possibilities others will want to join
6286148 oh wait i did this all to myself holy shit everything is fine now
6286149 i scheduled a 3 p m practice before the game and allowed everyone to hit 30 balls and it paid off i thought they were hitting ok but i wanted them to be slapping the ball tonight and they did
6286150 i tell you what this worked so well with the practice that i am scheduling another one today
6286151 we had a rain delay and after they took the tarp off renner just crushed a ball over the left field wall he was due for a good game and deservingly so received the tellefsen award for being the offensive player of the game
6286152 they have two real good pitchers and i dont know which one will go tomorrow but we have brandon bergen ready
6286153 we felt from the fourth inning on that we had the game under control and easter just did a fantastic job for us
6286154 i think we surprised a lot of people because florida is a lot better than what they played
6286155 he did what we asked him to do and the kids are starting to call him astros closer jose valverde because he has that high leg kick just like valverde
6286156 we have 27 returning varsity players and 20 of them started at least four games last year
6286157 all but five of them are going to be sophomores and juniors this year
6286158 we had a great great player named d j monroe
6286159 he was 92 percent of our offense and 80 percent of defense and all of our kicking game
6286160 everyone knows that angleton has great team speed but when you cant push and pull the other guys around you are going to struggle
6286161 our whole offseason has been to develop our strength we want those players to be just as tough as our skill players are
6286162 for the next three years we are going to have some big kids who can match up with the opponents we have to beat we need those big guys up front to plow the way
6286163 our level of success in the program for the next three years will be in the development of our offensive and defensive line
6286164 the fact is that you can have a great team and go 5 5 or 6 4 real quick in this district
6286165 but we will be well prepared we will know how to travel

6286180 cuando un candidato liberal gana unas primarias explica tiende a girar hacia el centro y la derecha a prescindir de sus compromisos m s progresistas esto es lo que est pasando con obama
6286181 esta es una de las grandes diferencias de esta campa a obama ha dotado a los j venes de la capacidad de organizarse y conectarse directamente con la campa a
6286182 el senador ha dado poder a las bases alterando para siempre la antigua estructura electoral de una jerarqu a superior organizando a los voluntarios ahora estos voluntarios se pueden organizar a s mismos
6286183 un di logo abierto es muy importante para cualquier campa a y estamos contentos con el hecho de que el sitio oficial se haya convertido en un veh culo para esa conversaci n
6286184 lo que es una novedad es que un candidato conceda a sus voluntarios la capacidad de organizarse por s mismos a trav s de redes sociales
6286185 en este sentido obama ha ganado una s lida ventaja sobre el candidato republicano john mccain
6286186 los pol ticos ten an que darse cuenta de que hay muchos votantes activos que se conectan a aplicaciones como facebook

6286217 a young lady from executive relations called me and weve been talking since
6286218 she took all of my notes and trials and errors to engineering
6286219 it frees windbag conservatives like me to return to what they do best moralizing about the failings of others
6286220 the public can now effectively pretend senators ted stevens larry craig david vitter or congressman mark foley and tom delay never came to national attention under unflattering circumstances i know i have
6286221 we hope voters will think of edwards behavior when they hear the term democrat and consider that support for that party could potentially result in their spouse being unfaithful to them in the next election cycle
6286222 mistakes happen if your basis for candidate is a flawless personal life perhaps youd better revisit the purpose of elected office
6286223 his confession of infidelity would have been a lot easier to take if he had been more obnoxiously supportive of traditional family roles and that sort of stuff

6286227 okay how do we have an entry level price point
6286228 the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes
6286229 i have a pro life record and our administration will have pro life policies
6286230 why did no one run over to help him in an emergency maybe his life could have been saved
6286231 peoples lives are being lost but sometimes i wonder if anyone cares if another mexican immigrant dies
6286232 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6286233 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6286234 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6286235 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6286236 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6286237 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6286238 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6286239 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6286240 and moscow girls make me sing and shout that georgias always on my mind
6286241 most frequently ideas about a struggle for truth and justice are formed by personalities with a paranoid structure
6286242 this is one of the most effective measures of the struggle of the west against the powerful russian state
6286243 i can firmly maintain that the opinions spread in those year that psychiatric terror existed in our country and that there was a punitive psychiatry are the fabrication of those people who now are defending the totalitarian sects this is slander which was used for antisoviet purposes and now is used for anti russian goals
6286244 and that essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion
6286245 i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel when the water that they know would produce a profitable crop simply isnt available on zero allocations
6286246 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6286247 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6286248 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6286249 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6286250 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988

6286252 we are about sticking by athletes through thick and thin through injury and poor performances
6286253 that is why sports are such an exciting field there are no guarantees there is heartbreak and failure as well as excitement and triumph
6286254 i think the folks at nike do want to come out of the games with a big win they have the luxury of multiple opportunities for that
6286255 not that they arent winning medals all over the place
6286256 but those big iconic victories that transcend the games that just hasnt happened yet
6286257 its really been fun to watch and to watch this u s basketball team perform
6286258 i wouldnt say we expected it such good performance but we hoped for it
6286259 the u s basketball team is becoming a global favorite again
6286260 at this point in time were going to have to be looking for guys who arent having the best years
6286261 i understand the frustration that warren mundine feels about the opportunities for indigenous job seekers and the fact that we havent done enough in this particular area
6286262 the government is very committed to ensuring we provide every bit of support we can for indigenous job seekers in order to close the gap between indigenous and non indigenous people that are in work but we will not treat australians differently
6286263 we believe that there is a mutual obligation principle underlying people who are in receipt of income and we will not treat people differently as a result of any announcements made by anyone
6286264 we need to say this country will look after you if you cant get a job or youre living in certain circumstances but we expect you to make a contribution back and thats not just aboriginal people
6286265 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6286266 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6286267 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6286268 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6286269 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6286270 eventually the mud will wash away the tribe will clean up whatever trash and it will be as beautiful as ever
6286271 it was one of the most invigorating and exciting times ive ever spent outdoors
6286272 the decision will not be favourable to the north koreans because they after all gave up a scheduled game at home
6286273 they will also have to spend extra money for the trip
6286274 what could have happened in this case and its very real is that the locomotive could have come to a stop with both drivers blacked out and everyone knows carbon monoxide is a toxic gas and these two drivers could have passed away without anyone knowing
6286275 we took immediate action to make sure we fixed the issue
6286276 there was an issue with a pipe and an issue with the seals around some of the doors which weve rectified
6286277 weve also put contingencies in place to make sure they are checked on a more regular basis
6286278 to be a discriminating user of the internet is one of the most important skills we can give students
6286279 we will need to consider making that a formal part of the education system and students will need to be tested on it that needs to happen and it is very likely to happen in the future
6286280 ringing a friend and sitting for an exam having recourse to the internet or other online technologies would make the running of examinations extremely difficult
6286281 i think that it is interesting to see people being adventurous and exploring new technologies in all areas of learning including assessment
6286282 but the situation that faces most people within nsw is that sooner or later they will be obliged to take examinations that require them to demonstrate rote learning
6286283 i support having some tasks where students can access information from as many different sources as possible including the range of different technologies available
6286284 however knowledge is important and committing information to memory will always have a place in the school curriculum
6286285 that by taking such devices into the exam room they would risk a zero mark in the course
6286286 the open court rule which is extremely historically important has now become distorted by the effect of massive search engines

6286302 our road will not be easy the cynics where lobbyists write check after check and exxon turns record profits thats what happens when lobbyists set the agenda its a game where trade deals like nafta ship jobs overseas and force parents to compete with their teenagers to work for minimum wage at wal mart its a game ceo bonuses while another mother goes without health care for her sick child we cant keep driving a wider and wider gap between the few who are rich and the rest who struggle to keep pace even if theyre not rich

6286309 doesnt calling in bill clinton as the lead attacker merely underscore obamas central theme that its time to
6286310 other conservative politicians or former politicians have taken their anti mccain arguments to absurd lengths take tom delay for instance whose k street pandering led to numerous indictments and contributed greatly to the republican losses in 2006 the former house majority leader said without a trace of irony in his voice that john mccain has done more to hurt the republican party than any elected official i know of
6286311 i dont agree with mccain on several things hes gotten right on the economy hes right on foreign policy and hes right on the war on terror

6286319 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6286320 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6286321 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere

6286327 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6286328 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly can cause reproductive dysfunctions for both teen and adult females spontaneous abortion or miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their
6286329 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6286330 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6286331 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible or dependence
6286332 if you have had preeclampsia you should be aware that you are at increased risk for renal and and you should try to reduce that risk
6286333 historically the thought was that after delivery everything was fine but preeclampsia isnt benign and it may initiate a cascade of damage that takes years to develop into clinically relevant
6286334 the take home message from this study is that any young woman who has had any variant of preeclampsia and eclampsia needs to be monitored for ongoing or recurrent and diabetes
6286335 indeed the likelihood that did not develop even among women with three previous episodes of preeclampsia was greater than 99 percent
6286336 its critical that doctors and patients understand that there is now a linkage between preeclampsia and esrd for women whove had preeclampsia this is a reason to increase your sensitivity to healthy living and not add to your risk keep your weight down avoid smoking and avoid drinking too much also check for diabetes and blood pressure at least once a year
6286337 you know sudan has been in a war for the last you know two decades and a lot of people lost their lives and the generation that was born during that long long period of time never went to school never had an education
6286338 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices

6286365 given what has been going on between iran and the united states and the western world one cant help but wonder whether or not israel or the united states or perhaps both are planning to do something other than watch the current situation with iran
6286366 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans
6286367 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do
6286368 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6286369 we currently have the lowest standard variable rate of all the major banks and st george
6286370 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers

6286421 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6286422 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6286423 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6286424 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6286425 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6286426 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6286427 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6286428 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6286429 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6286430 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6286431 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6286432 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6286433 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6286434 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6286435 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6286436 i had to carry a clipboard with names and numbers all spring
6286437 theyre the best fundamental team in baseball they play the game the way its meant to be played
6286438 you look at the way they do things over there
6286439 and you want to be part of it it starts at the top with gardenhire he and the angels mike scioscia are the two best managers in baseball everyone wants to play for those guys
6286440 just so they can watch what the position players are doing i want them to see how hard theyre working
6286441 i tell them thats why i want you to throw strikes
6286442 somebody walks and you say hey whats going on here and if they walk two its like a sin
6286443 if you cant throw strikes theyll find someone who does
6286444 i dont know whether it was the right way or the wrong way
6286445 but it was our way when youre operating under certain parameters you have to execute parts of the game we have to catch the ball we have to pitch and we have to play defense we can win games 4 3 2 1 5 4 we cant get by in 9 8 8 7 games
6286446 we implemented many of the things theyre doing now but gardy has made it better the names change each year but youre trying to find the hungry guy wholl fit in and work hard
6286447 im sure people probably thought i was crazy when i signed but i look like a genius now
6286448 people were so wrong about this team because they dont know what were about
6286449 terry was a living embodiment of what goes on there
6286450 you cant have a leader jump ship when things go south a little bit
6286451 you cant imagine what that meant to everyone in the organization terry could have saved himself but he wasnt going to let everyone drown
6286452 i love those guys they taught me how to play the game
6286453 you grow up here and learn how to play the game the right way
6286454 nobody has an attitude the egos are checked at the door we hit a homer we dont show anybody up you fit in here or youre gone
6286455 the speed and the strength of our players is our strength we can all run and were pretty strong even our linemen can run
6286456 if you want to stay in the national rankings youre allowed one loss to a great team or another nationally ranked team
6286457 when have a nationally ranked team you have to have some kids on that team that are not just college talent but nfl talent too you have to have that element and its tough to have that element every year
6286458 we may have bit off more than we can chew but were just trying to venture out
6286459 the in state teams on his schedule are all good teams theyre all very competitive but you always wonder whats the level in florida whats the level in texas different places in the united states were just trying to see where we stand
6286460 i feel the reason for our success is the kids work ethic along with our coaches and mike srock
6286461 we won the state championship game on a weekend and the next monday afternoon we were in the weight room they didnt have to be there our kids are dedicated they work and schedule their vacations around days we are not doing anything which is not many
6286462 all of our program is built for speed we lay a level of strength but we do a lot of powerlifting especially the power clean working with kettles and bands theres no such thing as keeping your strength youre either gaining it or losing it we tested our guys the wednesday after the season and we were quicker and stronger a lot of teams peak in july and get weaker and slower as the season goes on
6286463 ive been wanting to play for byrnes since i was a kid
6286464 youd have to say to yourself this is in fact world war iii

6286466 i know general manager frank wren knows that i have an interest in pitching again next year
6286467 all of that will depend on how this all plays out
6286468 es una ciudad masculina prefiero par s que es m s femenina

6286470 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6286471 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6286472 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6286473 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6286474 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6286475 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6286476 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6286477 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6286478 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6286479 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6286480 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6286481 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6286482 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6286483 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6286484 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6286485 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6286486 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6286487 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6286488 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6286489 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6286490 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6286491 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6286492 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6286493 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6286494 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6286495 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6286496 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6286497 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6286498 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6286499 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6286500 who are open to doing something on the production side
6286501 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6286502 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6286503 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6286504 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6286505 hey you old ladies are adorable and i want to post your photos on the internet kay

6286510 it is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy

6286518 playing at the professional level is much different than playing in college
6286519 unlike college you are out there playing for yourself its a much different experience now that i am representing only myself instead of a team and university

6286521 i have set goals for myself to reach and am motivated to strive towards them every time i step onto the tennis court
6286522 it was hard financially to keep playing in some of these tournaments with all of the travel expenses that you have not everyone is as fortunate as me to have their parents support them while they are trying to make it i am really thankful that my dad was able to support me during the first few years

6286540 i could very easily see josh hamilton hitting a grand slam hes having i dont want to say spectacular but hes having a pretty good year i didnt like wheeler against him either
6286541 hes got a pretty good shot at tying it up
6286542 with byrd and a single we still have the lead extra bases maybe ties it up and a home run wins the game but i could easily imagine hamilton tying it up right there so i chose to walk him even though byrd was 2 for 3 with an extra base hit off wheeler id rather see him up there

6286589 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

6286598 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

6286661 what are you going to do in the embassy and for what purpose
6286662 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6286663 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6286664 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6286665 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6286666 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6286667 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6286668 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6286669 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6286670 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6286671 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6286672 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6286673 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6286674 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6286675 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6286676 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6286677 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6286678 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6286679 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6286680 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6286681 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6286887 you havent explained to me how the very people who you claim are supporting you now had these superlative things to say about john kerry back in the day when he was serving in vietnam i dont understand the discrepancy maybe you could explain it
6286888 sure they were hardly superlative if you look at john kerry rated as a member of a group youll find that virtually everybody in the group got the same ones commander hibbard related generally graded john kerry as not observed so you take that two or three items and ignored the not observed item on there
6286889 e verything he did observe him on he was superlative
6286890 since the left seems to think this is relevant we can now all agree the swift boat veterans attacks against kerry were legitmate right

6286902 ramuan tradisional untuk balimau tersebut adalah warisan turun temurun sejak dulunya sejak puluhan tahun lalu bahkan konon sejak ratusan tahun lalu

6286904 balimau merupakan ajang silaturrahmi di mana anak kemenakan biasanya mengoleskan ramuan balimau ke kepala para mamaknya

6286906 tradisi balimau yang sudah membudaya dikampung kampung dan dinagari di ranah minang maka tradisi balimau tidak bisa dihapus begitu saja

6286928 its nice to give somebody a second chance a third chance i just hope he makes it
6286929 to have him back is no surprise as far as the things hes capable of doing
6286930 its just whether hes willing to go out and do the things he needs to do to be on this team thats take care of his business off the field and on the field talking to him on tuesday thats where he seems to be at hes in high spirits and he seems to have learned his lesson
6286931 mr brown can do what he wants to do im happy for chris that he has this opportunity hopefully he makes the most of it
6286932 liberal in alberta has some baggage from the federal liberals i know a lot of people in this province who would like a centrist party im committed to recognizing that there are weaknesses within the party and addressing them
6286933 over the next few years im also on the record as saying that we may have to revisit the name of the alberta liberal party
6286934 well do our opposition meeting this morning and itll probably be a bit shorter because i think if you go into it too much it can become quite daunting
6286935 so lets concentrate on what were trying to achieve rather than looking at the whatever you want to call them behemoth
6286936 its like when you clinch the division and know youre going to be in the playoffs
6286937 we agree with the government that you must assist emissions intensive trade exposed business to avoid carbon leakage
6286938 the question is how to do that in a way which reduces global emissions without damaging the australian economy
6286939 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors
6286940 i count myself as a conservative republican yet i view it to a large degree in the theodore roosevelt mold
6286941 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
6286942 i respect the right of the states to make those decisions
6286943 because of the bubble that a president is in and the bubble that a candidate is in sometimes you find out afterwards something that oh boy i wish i had heard thus and such and so and so
6286944 so i appreciate and want some of the tension i dont want too much of it
6286945 we are in a situation today where all words are parsed all comments are diagnosed and looked at for whatever effect they might have
6286946 we have to feed the beast the hourly cable shows the instant news in the blogs and all that that is just the situation that were in and im not complaining about it because that would be both foolish and a waste of time
6286947 no i have to base my approach to sen obama as one of respect
6286948 as long as i do that then i dont have to worry about any language i might use
6286949 i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon getting on myself i dont expect to be a great communicator i dont expect to set up my own blog but i am becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need
6286950 brooke and mark show me drudge obviously everybody watches for better or for worse drudge sometimes i look at politico sometimes realpolitics
6286951 i dont e mail ive never felt the particular need to e mail
6286952 i dont know if a government quote bailout is necessary now
6286953 because there are other courses of action that are being explored in order to ensure their survival but i dont believe we can afford to have them fail because of their impact on the overall economy
6286954 i believe less governance is the best governance and that government should not do what the free enterprise and private enterprise and individual entrepreneurship and the states can do but i also believe there is a role for government
6286955 government should take care of those in america who can not take care of themselves
6286956 we are not aware of any australians involved in the incident however our embassy in madrid is in contact with local authorities hospitals and the airline to ascertain if any australians are affected
6286957 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6286958 at this sad moment italy united with your country by traditional bonds of friendship feels particularly close to the spanish people
6286959 his thoughts are with the spanish people and all those affected by the tragedy
6286960 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured
6286961 at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers
6286962 its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement

6286967 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6286968 chinese reporters understood from the beginning they understood seven years ago when these promises were made that these promises were not about them at all
6286969 not used to the stuff and too drowsy to understand anything i helped myself to a second one
6286970 the only potential issue is if there is an emergency in the middle of the night but honestly i am not sure it is worse than being sleep deprived there too of course ambien can have side effects for example on memory sleep deprivation too life is a trade off
6286971 well if you ask me i am always going to say chinese because i love it specially the restaurant i always pick
6286972 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6286973 we are hoping to get as wide an approval as possible so that we can move on with regard to having this agreement for congress to look at but i dont want to get ahead of the suppliers group meeting
6286974 we think this agreement is very good for the united states and india and for the international community otherwise we would not be pursuing this
6286975 the immediate termination of all nuclear commerce by nsg member states if new delhi detonates a nuclear explosive device
6286976 would be inconsistent with us law place american firms at a severe competitive disadvantage and undermine critical us nonproliferation objectives
6286977 a rivalry made all the more precarious by the resignation on tuesday of the pakistani president pervez musharraf
6286978 this deal was foolish when pakistan was relatively stable with mr musharraf gone an arms race on the subcontinent would likely be more difficult to control
6286979 if the democrats brand of economic populism were an untapped electoral reservoir in the south southern state budgets would not be among the lowest per capita in the country unions would not be weaker than in any other region and working class white southerners would already be joined at the hip with working class black southerners as the backbone of the most democratic region in america

6286981 a statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition without the opportunity to deliberate or fabricate
6286982 excitement of an event suspends the declarants powers of reflection and fabrication consequently minimizing the possibility that the utterance will be influenced by self interest and therefore rendered unreliable

6286988 fitness is a far better indicator of health than body mass index
6286989 but the most striking finding was that fitness level regardless of body mass index was the strongest predictor of mortality risk
6286990 we all knew it had to stop at some point
6286991 but we thought it might just level itself off not stop and go backwards
6286992 weve found the volume of transactions has dropped significantly probably by half and where there are interested buyers theyre really struggling to get finance
6286993 this time last year this would have gone within hours now its been on the market a month and theres very little interest

6287004 gabe and i have talked about joining forces ever since i was in law school and gabe was in his first law office on nassau street gabe and dave have obviously enjoyed great success and they have inspired and encouraged me along the way i am positively ecstatic to be here
6287005 gabe and i are very excited about the energy experience and legal talent that peter brings to bear on behalf of our clients but above all were just happy that he has finally come home
6287006 peter is one of those rare legal talents who have the brains the skills and the charisma to persuade people and to engender trust we are both proud and thrilled to have him join us
6287007 well i didnt take the new jersey bar exam just for the plaque
6287008 i just love the law plain and simple as odd as it may seem im one of those lawyers who read legal briefs and judicial opinions just for fun i feel that someone who loves his job is likely to be pretty good at it and i definitely love my job
6287009 some lawyers believe the facts are the facts and youre stuck with them i couldnt disagree more indeed i approach every case with the belief that the decision maker wants to be persuaded one way or the other its my job to give them a reason to agree with me
6287010 ive been coming to glenwood drive in for burgers since about 1959 when my dad would take me here after a hike at the nearby sleeping giant state park
6287011 these things are never as good as you remember them
6287012 i grew up eating at glenwood and i always loved it ive lived away from hamden for 30 years but each year when i visit famly glenwood is always on the menu sometimes once a day the lobster rolls dramatically increase your food bill but its a must to order the lobster roll platter adds a few extra dollars too totalling about 18 per order as of 12 07 the footlong hotdogs are still served in a grilled roll and the toppings
6287013 this charcoal grill fills the dining room with the irresistible aroma of fire cooked meats
6287014 a hot lobster roll is almost nothing like a cold lobster salad roll it has no mayo no lettuce nothing but lobster meat and butter in the bun
6287015 glenwoods hot dogs are served the traditional new england way inside lightly toasted split buns add your own condiments
6287016 the glenwood drive in is at least as famous for its onion rings as for its hamburgers and hot dogs when you stand in line waiting for your order you can see them battered and fried
6287017 have them first and worry about bringing them up later

6287066 no tenemos ni la m s remota idea de por qu lo hacen
6287067 estamos haciendo observaciones sistem ticas para determinar si hay algo que pueda desencadenar este comportamiento pero hasta ahora no hemos encontrado nada
6287068 esto indica que aprenden unos de otros lo que realmente no es una sorpresa pero tambi n parece que exhiben elementos de lo que en los seres humanos podr amos llamar un comportamiento cultural

6287079 the days of just leaving 90 000 seater stadia particularly in london where youd have two with the new wembley stadium are over
6287080 you have to provide something for local communities to do more than simply press their noses up against
6287081 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing
6287082 were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium for which weve been discussing a number of anchor tenancies as well as possibly an educational legacy or even an entertainment legacy
6287083 weve been looking at the legacy from the very moment our teams started looking at the master plans

6287112 e un sogno che diventa realt ero un po preoccupato dopo le semifinali ma mi sono detto bisogna dare tutto durante la corsa sono molto soddisfatto di me stesso non mi sarei mai aspettato un risultato del genere so che questa una pista veloce ma non credevo che questo tempo fosse possibile sono sotto choc ho sognato a lungo questo record del mondo lavorato tantissimo per diventare campione e rimanere al vertice sono andato benissimo sono uscito benissimo dai blocchi ho cominciato a correre il pi veloce possibile e quando sono arrivato sul rettilineo ho detto a me stesso vai pi forte che puoi non morire adesso
6287113 when we came to know that the crucial email was sent from haywoods computer our first reaction was to question all his neighbours in his building at sanpada visitors to the buildings and even residents of neighbouring buildings about 1 000 persons were questioned with the help of computer experts then we reversed the investigation by focusing on haywood
6287114 we zeroed in on 12 persons with whom haywood was closely interacting and one of them turned out to be ali haywood told us that he interacted with ali a person with links in lucknow in his professional capacity as an english language trainer we are trying to ascertain if ali was the person who gave haywoods email id to abdul subhan quereshi the computer wizard who is suspected to have sent the terror email through the americans laptop
6287115 since the results of a polygraph tests are inconclusive and the ats felt that haywood was telling the complete truth we decided to conduct the narco test on him he obviously fled when he came to know about this

6287135 its funny they announced theyll spend 20 million reaching out to hispanic voters but when you go to florida the only spanish ads are by john mccain
6287136 at the end of the day john mccain doesnt need an introduction with the latino community he has been working for more than two decades on the values principles and issues latino voters care about
6287137 the interesting thing about these swing states in the southwest is that theyre swing and the latino vote is very strong
6287138 if ive spoken to 10 major people who were at the meeting nine of them even up until mid july were still unhappy with latino access and status within the obama campaign and his outreach

6287310 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defence aimed at russia
6287311 the purpose of missile defence is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
6287312 we are here to take up the fight against russia
6287313 contrary to the official version presented by prime minister tusk and the us state department the war in georgia played a key role in accelerating the polish american negotiations on the defence shield it is the war that has prompted tusk to give the go ahead for the signing of the agreement
6287314 the fact that the us ruled out this compromise proposal permits only one conclusion that the missile shield is directed first and foremost not against iran but against russia this is underlined by the fact that the other bases for the missile system are also located in border regions to russia for example alaska
6287315 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow is capable of launching following an american first strike
6287316 the missile system is therefore a crucial element in the attempt to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for the stationing of just ten interceptor missiles in poland but once the system is established their number could be easily increased
6287317 this article makes very clear the actual function of the missile system it is to guarantee the us the capacity to carry out nuclear war without the risk of a counter strike if this capacity can be achieved then it can be employed as a geopolitical argument in order to implement national interests
6287318 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent

6287328 our soldiers cant die for uncle sam these soldiers were doing their duty but they did not die for france they died in the endless war that the united states is fighting in afghanistan to defend their own interests
6287329 the number of victims is notably explained according to these soldiers by the slowness of the reaction of the command and serious problems of coordination

6287333 targetting us and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
6287334 they clearly believe they are winning now and its causing them to be a bit more audacious
6287335 sends a clear message that current western strategy in afghanistan is failing until now western leaders have been in denial about the true extent of taliban presence in afghanistan and their ability to move swiftly on the afghan capital
6287336 a new troop deployment is required simply to secure the capital with the taliban on the very doorstep of the afghan capital the situation can only get worse for nato isaf forces and the afghan people

6287339 a majority of my students are english speakers so i have to take it down to their level
6287340 we felt that the best way to meet the needs of our community was to start the bilingual program
6287341 the bilingual program is very important for the school it helps service those that come in with spanish as their native language but overall it helps both
6287342 students have a creative outlook when they find out there is more than one way to do things
6287343 they learn that there are different routes for solving problems and they are exposed to each others culture

6287360 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly can cause reproductive dysfunctions for both teen and adult females spontaneous abortion or miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their
6287361 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6287362 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6287363 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible or dependence

6287367 acting on behalf of the us suggested to my high ranking representatives that i should stop all kinds of political and public activities give no interview and publish no articles and books in other words they wanted me to disappear for quite a long period of time until the full implementation of the dayton accord mr holbrooke said he would allow me to avoid facing war crimes charges in exchange for keeping a low profile he also warned me that my personality would be facing very harsh criticism to prevent my supporters from undermining the implementation of the dayton accord in line with our deal former secretary of state under president bill clinton madeleine albright proposed to the president of the republika srpska bilyana plavsic that i should leave for russia greece or serbia to open a private medical clinic there
6287368 i negotiated a very tough deal he had to step down immediately from both his posts as president of the serb part of bosnia and as head of his party and he did so
6287369 but when he disappeared he put out a piece of disinformation that i had cut a deal with him if he disappeared we wouldnt pursue him that was a completely false statement
6287370 there was never any deal to give him immunity from capture it was simply that nato failed to capture him thats natos failure not a deal
6287371 holbrooke strongly promised that the hague tribunal would be history for karadzic if he withdrew from politics forever
6287372 we spoke with many witnesses who confirmed this agreement however we did not find any documents to prove it the fact is that no one in bosnia wanted to arrest karadzic when he was still reachable holbrookes current overreaction and his overly energetic denial of the notion of a bilateral deal raises certain doubts
6287373 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
6287374 i am investigating the story of an agreement between karadzic and holbrooke
6287375 information about the fugitives whereabouts was abundant however it would always turn out that one of the three countries the us britain or france would block arrests
6287376 sometimes arrest operations were halted by former french president jacques chirac personally other times by clinton
6287377 the reasons why western powers dont want to see karadzic and maldic on trial is their very likely intent to put the blame for the crimes they have committed on the international community by saying that they have been given a green or orange light to take over the srebrenica enclave
6287378 western powers created the conditions for mass killings to happen
6287379 there was an effort to steer justice to justify the actions of the big powers in their response to the war the genocide
6287380 they consistently tried to overlook who was indicted and then selectively provided evidence and even altered it depending if the tribunal mandate to establish the truth would harm them or not

6287387 deadwood was a great experience working with david milch whos one of the real geniuses of hollywood id seen the series and ian mcshane ive known for years we didnt know each other subsequently become great friends but wed been around one another for 40 years and i just thought that ian was giving the performance of his career the acting on that show was just second to none it was amazing and the scripts just dazzled this whole look at the west and what it really constituted davids premise was that the hays office kind of propagandized the old west because in reality there was this mixture of the bible and cuss words and also the classics because everybody was much better read than people gave them credit for when you signed up for deadwood all you had was your character you didnt know how he was going to be used they described my character to me and told me he was someone theyd wanted to bring in from the word go but hbo thought it would be too expensive to have a theatre and all that stuff so they didnt bring me on until the third series and i had a ball i just loved it its not for everybody because you have to really trust that youre going to be taken care of i had faith that if they used the character he was going to be used well i was sad we didnt do a fourth series because i felt they were about to get into my whole relationship with swearengen and the fact that i ended up being his only friend and clearly was going to be the guy who ultimately was going to help with his removal its just a fascinating fascinating show a great piece of work

6287391 on campus legal drinking age is flunking the reality test
6287392 the amethyst initiative the brainchild of former middlebury college president john mccardell is an effort to push lawmakers and the broader public to do something that is politically tough consider making it legal for younger people to drink how could making teenage drinking easier possibly help reduce teen drinking when i was in college three decades ago 18 year olds could drink openly and legally and generally did so in public settings including at cocktail parties with faculty members and at a college run pub where professors and staffers mixed with students the result of course with plenty of extreme exceptions was that kids learned moderation nobody had to hide and adults were around considerably more often when students were drinking the very notion of lowering the drinking age is flabbergasting to groups such as mothers against drunk driving which this week put out a statement arguing that a 1984 federal law forcing states to raise the legal age to 21 has saved 25 000 lives madd agrees that campus bingeing is a big problem and says the answer is to tighten alcohol policies punish violators and go after adults who provide alcohol to kids but mote and other presidents can point to long lists of enforcement education and counseling efforts that are in place with little real impact

6287395 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6287396 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment
6287397 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6287398 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher
6287399 this is especially true of cancers involving the but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6287400 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6287401 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6287402 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6287403 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6287404 but when we give medications to millions we need information about risks versus benefits
6287405 there are some question marks and they may change the risk benefit ratio for some patients

6287421 in april it was reported that the fbi had been focusing on as many as four suspects
6287422 confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
6287423 i was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described the tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years this is not spin this is not true
6287424 the fbi has completely shut congress out of its investigation into anthrax attacks on capitol hill and around the nation
6287425 scientists in and out of government say the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to congress and the media
6287426 this was an astonishing thing to do it should have been preserved as evidence this was a roadmap of everybody and anybody that had gotten access to develop the super strain that hit leahy and daschle
6287427 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators
6287428 during earlier inspections we told the landlords to dig pit latrines and gave them a deadline but they turned a deaf ear to the warning

6287475 we will remove the option of a suspended sentence when courts are dealing with assaults on police or other public officers
6287476 simply removing suspended terms of imprisonment as an option is a terribly soft response
6287477 our policy is absolutely clear if you assault a police officer with the requisite level of bodily harm you will receive a term of imprisonment

6287490 its almost like a fresh start for me and another chance so im determined to go for it
6287491 i see the signing of this calibre of player as a clear statement of intent as to where the future of salford should be

6287541 penyusuan susu ibu merupakan sesuatu yang amat dekat di hati saya bagi saya penyusuan susu ibu merupakan satu satunya cara semulajadi untuk dilakukan oleh itu apabila anak saya amna nafeesa dilahirkan lima tahun yang lalu saya telahpun membuat keputusan untuk menyusukannya sehinggalah dia berumur dua tahun

6287555 john mccains economic plan favors one thing the creation of millions of new american jobs
6287556 i want to be a poo guy when i grow up and fix peoples sewer lines
6287557 this aircraft already had two flights cancelled because of problems
6287558 the plane was all broken up all full of bodies
6287559 its horrific everythings burned its a horror i dont want to tell you i dont want to tell you
6287560 its the most like hell ive ever seen the bodies were boiling we were burned trying to remove them
6287561 the aircraft was going to take off and the pilot realised there was a fault in the left engine and he returned to the stand they were thinking of changing aircraft and finally they authorised the departure in order to avoid more delay
6287562 all cres are trained for this and if the correct procedure is followed it doesnt have to end in an accident
6287563 normally if the left engine goes the aircraft veers to the left since all the power of the other engine throws you in that direction
6287564 but the aircraft fell on the right side of the runway
6287565 you are devastated because you only know that the person was on the plane you dont know if they are all right if they are among the dead you feel totally powerless
6287566 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those have been injured
6287567 it is with deep sadness that i learnt there had been an air accident which ended with so many victims
6287568 spanair is doing everything possible to assist the spanish authorities at this difficult time spanair will provide further information as soon as it becomes available
6287569 this isnt against us its part of a new global game
6287570 the aircraft carrier to syria is supposed to show that russia has allies and that it wants access to the mediterranean israel as a western state is merely one player in this global realignment russia is signalling in the strongest possible way that it is willing to activate its old soviet military alliances
6287571 today russias interest is to show the us and the west that it is a superpower again its back in the mediterranean its telling the west you need us in this region and you need us to deal with iran this is happening because it senses that the west is weak
6287572 as far as assad is concerned his new found russian friends could provide a deterrent against a future attack on syria
6287573 pakistan has done problematic things without any connection to arms sales to india such as the proliferation of nuclear know how to iran which has been going on for many years
6287574 we know that the pakistani government was not completely in the dark over pakistani nuclear scientist abdul qadeer khans nuclear smuggling network in this sense pakistan has been maneuvering in a way that has harmed this area irrespective of the indian connection
6287575 am i doing this for my clients or for my own ego
6287576 it has been going on since the 1970s it is customary
6287577 having employees attacked or robbed at gunpoint isnt good people worry that if you cant protect yourselves how can you protect others and their data
6287578 its like atms late at night or mall parking lots call center employees are vulnerable because call centers are frequently 24 hour operations and often located in industrial or sparsely populated office park areas
6287579 its not so much about protecting the more about protecting the data
6287580 discovering that someone who left two to three years ago still has access rights is the not even a horror story
6287581 apparently youre one of the best black hat seos in the world
6287582 leading a miniature army into simulated conflicts to victory or defeat allows me to sublimate those unresolved frustrations and release stress in a way that i have found relaxing and energizing
6287583 when i lived in southern california my outlet for stress revolved around speed the go fast world of 600 plus
6287584 all formal requirements including the response from the convicts as to whether they have requested clemency or not are not yet in my hands
6287585 i have no idea where or at what stage the paperwork is now
6287586 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6287587 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6287588 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission
6287589 its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture
6287590 can only be positive for map but it doesnt wipe out the questions from before or the concerns of some allies none of that has gone away
6287591 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defence
6287592 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6287593 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6287594 do we really mean to commit ourselves to war against the russian federation if something like this happens again
6287595 every other option needs to be explored and its got to be realistic
6287596 its great to have all these ideas of being able to do things but its got to be realistic and its got to be achievable
6287597 the worst thing you could do is to prolong suffering with the animal
6287598 one of the important issues which should cause concerns here is that humpback whales are the whales that australia has particularly taken a strong position with in terms of their protection and conservation at the international level
6287599 measures to be considered include the suspension of particular governments from the forum
6287600 in times of universal deceit telling the truth will be a revolutionary act
6287601 growing up in a computer science family got me exposed to some of the greatest minds of computer security at a young age when i was little my dads friend was peter neumann one of the worlds greatest security engineers if we had a nobel prize for computer security he would have won it three times these were extremely interesting people who were knowledgeable about everything not just technology they told the most interesting anecdotes from the worlds of both art and science i decided early on to be sort of like that similarly cliff stoll was an astronomer before getting into security and a lot of the good computer security experts are from different disciplines so they take a different view richard feynman a physicist was breaking codes during the manhattan project using techniques we now use to crack passwords he was one of the worlds first hackers
6287602 i was following my moms advice to join a company that wouldnt change much
6287603 on my internal team ive got about 10 fte security management folks and we use an outsourced security provider for security operations
6287604 what i struggle with and sometimes get flabbergasted at is the unprofessionalism i see in security providers
6287605 in the end its about relationships holding people accountable and surrounding yourself with people who challenge you while it might be comfortable to surround ourselves with people who think like us in my view its not healthy because you get a jaded or one sided perspective
6287606 its where i cut my teeth on the area of fraud
6287607 i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand i shall not be moved
6287608 that statement is actually not news several government officials have been claiming it ever since the icc first started looking into the situation in darfur but the thing about the claim is that it is not totally inaccurate in one sense and that is if the sudanese government decides to try the people who have been charged by the icc for the same crimes in national courts in proceedings then they can bring an admissibility challenge before the icc which is to say the way the international criminal court was established was so that national courts would have primary jurisdiction over cases but that means the government would have to be willing and able to try the case themselves
6287609 in this case sudan has not shown itself so far to be willing to try any of the people involved in the crime in darfur so it is unlikely that an admissibility challenge will succeed so the real challenge will be securing arrest without cooperation of the sudanese government
6287610 what i have heard is that there is a fear of retaliation by government forces or government sympathizers allied militia against peacekeepers and humanitarian workers if an arrest warrant is issued but with all parties be it rebels or government forces international humanitarian law requires that they not attack peacekeepers or humanitarian workers the security council and others need to make it clear that if additional crimes are committed there would be consequences for those acts
6287611 i think that threats of retaliation and i think attacks on peacekeepers should make it basically embarrassing for people who are supporters of the sudanese government in this context to continue to support them this type of regime is not something that other governments should be willing to stand behind even if in principle they think that issuing an arrest warrants against the head of a government while it is still in conflict is problematic
6287612 my real age is 16 i dont care about what other people say its none of my business
6287613 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegation of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely
6287614 how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china
6287615 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
6287616 i expected it to be more high pointed than that but it was the first game of the day and i think i was a bit nervous
6287617 now ive gained my confidence im warmed up so hopefully ill do better in the next game which is a bit tougher than this one
6287618 fitness is the main key for this game and confidence too if they kick once i have to kick twice
6287619 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans the bank said
6287620 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do commonwealth said in a statement today
6287621 it is in our interest to pass on as much as we can to our customers and to remain competitive
6287622 we currently have the lowest standard variable rate of all the major banks and st george

6287628 i think honestly it goes back to the situation that were in youve got to be careful what youre ossuring because its going to come back and haunt you
6287629 once you start making fun its just not what youre supposed to do as adults is make fun of rabbonim to make a satire of a ban is just dangerous
6287630 you can see how upset the kids are about the whole thing i think it really exposes an underlying problem that people think these kids are dopes and can be dictated too
6287631 they are very naive about how a kid thinks and how he should be educated
6287632 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6287633 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6287634 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6287635 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect
6287636 romer left colorado to become superintendent of schools for the los angeles unified school district a job he held for more than a decade that districts school board was controlled by the teachers union and he had a friendly city council as well
6287637 underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself
6287638 the reason i see a bright future is because of dutch eenhoorn
6287639 hes the one who has his fingers on the heartbeat of europe if anybody is going to keep it going and even make it stronger its him he is trying his best to get involved more with major league baseball
6287640 no doubt we have dominated europe for as long as i know
6287641 we get more kids signed than anybody else i think that number will grow i think we have a bright future if you have your players playing in the better competitions in the world its just a matter of time before youll be able to compete with everybody in the world
6287642 it was very hard on him and his wife but they have a very healthy boy now
6287643 theyre probably the most advanced european country as far as baseball
6287644 they just dont play it in europe countries that dont play it at the little league level have no chance thats why its dying in youre going to get zero backing from europe because its not a spectator sport there london isnt going to miss it
6287645 this sport is committed to having many people playing from an early age everywhere
6287646 he does a lot of work for the yankees over where he is he tells them hey this guy can play from or whatever
6287647 when he needs a favor from the yankees im the favor
6287648 the gap between the different teams in the world is getting smaller
6287649 its starting to come along the last two outings ive been making adjustments to get where i needed to be
6287650 pedro kept them off balance and got big outs when he needed to
6287651 he pitched extremely well for us it was very impressive we need that type of effort going forward
6287652 for him to come back and hopefully do this for us is going to be nice
6287653 he pitched great hopefully hell do it the rest of the season hopefully we can get him back next year and he can do it the whole year
6287654 its great that were in a little bit of a groove now but we cant get ahead of ourselves
6287655 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6287656 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6287657 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6287658 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6287659 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6287660 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6287661 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6287662 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6287663 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6287664 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6287665 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6287666 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6287667 unfortunately australia doesnt have much data coming out so we took direction from the us dollar and commodity prices
6287668 although the us economy is weaker it does seem the global markets are pricing in a loosening of monetary policy with the european central bank the reserve bank of australia and the reserve bank of new zealand
6287669 although the news is still grim for the us the rest of the world is starting to catch up
6287670 hicimos un buen trabajo estudiando a canad y el resultado es positivo

6287674 missouri is evocative of the heartland to which presidential candidates attach themselves
6287675 in the past five elections the republican candidate won an average of 46 5 percent of the vote and the democratic candidate won 46 1 percent making missouri the closest state during that time period
6287676 it is probably the democrats best chance to take over a republican held seat cq politics rates this race no clear favorite our most competitive category
6287677 its too early to think of those things but cliff has had as good a year as anybody
6287678 any time you snap one away late like that it feels good
6287679 ive made some adjustments and am playing with more confidence
6287680 this game felt good it gives me more positive thinking
6287681 pienso que el proceso formal se ha iniciado con el establecimiento de la comisi n otan georgia
6287682 creo que es correcto ver las candidaturas de georgia y ucrania como parte de un proceso de construcci n de esos pa ses como partes integrantes y no s lo como un accidente
6287683 en t rminos pr cticos la otan est ofreciendo una estrecha cooperaci n al gobierno georgiano y los militares de georgia

6287685 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting

6287687 well that was actually false information i think people were calling up my parents and trying to figure out whats going on and all of a sudden theyre getting all these phone calls
6287688 they love and support me of course they have their own opinions but you can never take a tabloid seriously if they werent supportive they wouldnt come to all the shows people like to make games out of other peoples lives

6287690 a uk conference is long overdue agents are more likely to attend a uk event because of cost and time it would be easier and cheaper

6287700 the somerfield stores are an opportunity and we are working closely with our food partners in areas where there might be huge footfall
6287701 in some of our larger the co operative group food stores where we do not have a presence we are going in as part of a family of businesses offering our banking pharmacy and travel outlets
6287702 the last time we had anything like this was about 10 or 15 years ago during a really bad summer
6287703 only yesterday 10 people turned up in their wellies desperate to get away
6287704 unfortunately as they had already paid for one holiday to cornwall we were not able to get them away as their budget wouldnt stretch that far
6287705 where is the guidance for homeowners my neighbors that lost all their stuff whos coming down and telling us what to do
6287706 winters coming we have no furnaces my duct work is gone my plumbing is gone
6287707 do we have any money coming to them people because all any of us have heard is its just going to public areas i have nothing against taking care of the little league but lets take care of the people first
6287708 did the department of health come down and inspect the hollow we have sewage in our grass residents have sewage and stink in their basements i cant sit on my patio at night because the black flies and the flies that weve never had down there drive you out
6287709 we cant put up with this we cannot sustain this damage over and over and over
6287710 theres got to be a plan set in place by engineers hopefully the government will step in and help us with that plan
6287711 i didnt think we would have nearly this turnout said deputy mayor steve macdonald
6287712 if you are going to the university the bus can drive you right there and you dont have to worry about parking and getting into a cold car after warming it up there are all kinds of reasons why people might want to take a bus said stratford coun
6287713 we had to start somewhere and you start where you are likely to get the greatest number of users said griffin
6287714 the other thing is we have to do it all within half an hour to allow transfer to the other routes without paying any additional fare
6287715 it is the start of things but there are a lot of problems they have to face and only time will tell he said
6287716 of course the response to it is first thing people are not going to jump out of their cars and into a bus right away
6287717 our members are upset a baggage handler could sustain an injury at work and be denied sick pay
6287718 we hope to operate all flights as planned and normal booking conditions apply
6287719 contingency plans will be in place we expect it to be business as usual
6287720 if a boat tied up to captains cove had a fire on board whos going to go out there to rescue the people on board and put the fire out
6287721 its not just a matter of spraying water on the blaze
6287722 when this water cannon is running at full capacity the boat would actually spin backwards out of control unless you counteract the force of the water with the engines its not as easy as it looks
6287723 as an example there was a fire at the washburn amp doughty shipyard boatyard in boothbay up in maine
6287724 they lost everything millions of dollars in damage the worst fire there in 200 years that could have been prevented if they had a fireboat
6287725 all you see right now is just a hole in the ground surrounded by old stones and its all overrun by trees
6287726 but this part of the island is the first area the scots came to back in 1770 after the british took over the very first settler boat came to stanhope june of 1770 just as the province it was a colony then was just starting out
6287727 i dont even think its a building you just dont live in a house without scattering artifacts all around
6287728 the other site where we have a house although we havent found any structures we found a lot of artifacts
6287729 its so exciting its like wow i found something and its just interesting to think about how people lived back then like what it was like here
6287730 when you see this depression in the forest floor you can imagine thats the building there and thats what they lived in that size its pretty small compared to what we live in now but it was adequate for them
6287731 we have to clean it and analyze it but it looks like were dealing with late 18th and maybe early 19th and that would fit with the 1770 scottish settlement here
6287732 this could be one of the very very first homesteads that was every built in this area from the very first settlers that came here
6287733 i went away and started another career if you will and didnt think this opportunity was going to come around again
6287734 so when morrissey made this announcement i got a tremendous amount of calls and also ive made a lot of calls and arrived at this decision
6287735 he told me that when he got out on the campaign trail the fire just wasnt there
6287736 its still burning quite brightly ive always had a passion for politics and its still with me
6287737 gails been out and shes been working and i appreciate that
6287738 but im always pretty confident about what can be accomplished if you work hard
6287739 were letting the kids destroy the city and were doing little about it
6287740 its going to be dreadfully hard to reopen the park with all this graffiti

6287752 there has been no increase in the productivity of knowledge work i began to teach on my twentieth birthday november 19 1929 i gave my first university lecture there has been no improvement in the productivity of college faculty since if anything it has gone down because of committee meetings my distinguished colleagues spend god only knows how much time in committee meetings and there has never been a committee meeting that produced any results president roosevelt said if i want to make absolutely sure that nothing gets done i appoint a committee
6287753 to buy offsets for the carbon footprint theyll leave by traveling and staying in the metro area
6287754 basically carbon offsetting involves helping someone to do something that they wouldnt otherwise have done that results in less co2 emissions than would have happened had you not helped them to do it

6287757 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
6287758 t he fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the legislator is by exploring his intentions at the time when the law was made by signs the most natural and probable and these signs are either the words the context the subject matter the effects and consequence or the spirit and reason of the law as to the effects and consequence the rule is where words bear either none or a very absurd signification if literally understood we must a little deviate from the received sense of them
6287759 must not be indulged too far lest thereby we destroy all law

6287776 buat masa ini cukuplah dihantar surat perutusan bersama hadiah hadiah yang sesuai untuk memaklumkan kepada maharaja meiji bahawa jemputannya sudah diterima dan diberikan perhatian yang serius nyatakan yang tuanku akan menunaikan jemputan itu dengan sebaik mungkin

6287778 computer programs for deleting search history after accessing web sites
6287779 computer programs for disabling the history and file caching features of a web browser and computer software for notifying a user of a web browser when others are tracking web use and for controlling the information others can access about such use
6287780 users may wish to begin a private browsing session to research a medical condition or plan a surprise vacation or birthday party for a loved one
6287781 the larger challenge here is notifying users clearly about what sites theyre disclosing information to and enabling them to control that disclosure if they choose
6287782 the user is in control of what information the browser makes available to web sites
6287783 the writers with whom i tend to connect most strongly either as a reader or as someone with whom to talk about the writing process itself are those whose writing process includes an acknowledgment or perhaps i should say defeated resignation
6287784 i often say that myself and at that point it becomes a matter of well if it has to happen how am i going to make it happen

6287790 i was like oh my god how in the world did she get to chicago
6287791 like our family was complete i swear she purred for 24 hours
6287792 there arent that many times in life when you have a regret and you can do something about it
6287793 i spent a year missing that cat four hundred dollars is nothing
6287794 take the cash money and not use her credit cards to preclude being found
6287795 and whats disturbing about it is weve heard almost everything else thats negative about my client why have we never heard one peep about this maybe im asking for equal opportunity leaking but if theyre going to leak all the negative stuff they should at least leak some positive stuff

6287797 i felt like ive had a lot of weight on my shoulders trying to be perfect

6287799 its a pity for a big country like the to make such a small statement

6287804 i wanted to tell the story of the women around muhammad and to honor them and him as well
6287805 what i see as the islam muhammad envisioned has in crucial ways been changed i wanted to show people especially in the west about early islam

6287809 i think it definitely shows hes strong and capable of throwing about 120 pitches
6287810 actually i didnt think my fastball and location were that great at all
6287811 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did tonight
6287812 i got my adrenaline flowing around the eighth inning and the defense played great behind me
6287813 the toughest thing for me is to keep the ball down more consistently
6287814 its not a maybe thing youve got to do it ive got to work on that because its killing me
6287815 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6287816 dave michaelson i think that the key this year is going to be how everybody any team i dont care who it is how their young kids step in and they fill in because all of us have that with the exception of bismarck high having esley thorton back we are all going to have a new quarterback and that is exciting in some ways but it is also kind of scary
6287817 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6287818 i should have gone with him but i wish he didnt have to leave at all
6287819 some mothers feel liberated when their children leave home they feel as though they can finally do what they want i dont feel that way at all i feel like ive been hit by a bus

6287821 note to self dont forget to tear this parchment up into small pieces so nobody discovers that i am a witch
6287822 what a strange collection of our senior guild officials we have here
6287823 well i have been investigating a series of recently highly suspicious actions by several of the cityfolk
6287824 by carefully piecing together the evidence i was able to determine that a series of secretive meetings were being held by several of the city guildmasters with dark and mysterious intent
6287825 i noticed the trail of yipping puppies a cloaked and disfigured guildmaster and several senior cityfolk converging on a single building
6287826 and if that wasnt enough someone was listening at the door
6287827 ive been trying to get hold of someone anyone since this morning who will listen to me you see zane approached me recently and gave me a sealed envelope he said if anything was to happen to him i was to unseal it draw a crowd and read it out at the city square
6287828 what is in that letter and why were you listening at the door
6287829 i believe it is something that zane was planning to blackmail several senior guildmembers with he seemed so proud of himself i think he wanted to be the new mayor of the town perhaps it would have helped in some way to have a decisive mayor but i cant help but think that he was the wrong person
6287830 i was listening at the door because i wanted to know if it was true
6287831 you are quite correct this is a list of various senior cityfolk and their various transgressions quite a few interesting crimes here too perhaps we should go through them and
6287832 ah um okay perhaps the best thing to do is to get rid of this list we dont want to encourage this sort of thing after all
6287833 thats sorted out then theres now the matter of why you are all meeting i can only presume that the reason you are all here is to discuss zanes blackmail and his recent death and come up with a plan of action
6287834 definitely no elaborate plans involving framing zane for being a witch at all
6287835 well actually when i was listening at the door and i heard
6287836 i mean i heard them talk about what to do about zanes blackmail and death in an entirely honourable and honest way no deception or foul play or elaborate aborted plans discussed at all i can confirm their story entirely and in every detail
6287837 then we should continue with the pressing matter at hand the matter of zanes death
6287838 garthy was right there is a werewolf in the town
6287839 what do you mean garthy was right garthy was a witch
6287840 garthy is a witch and a werewolf burn him burn him
6287841 but he was only a witch yesterday we need to burn the werewolf too
6287842 we shouldnt need to burn in fear only in need
6287843 let us have no more talk of werewolf or guildmaster
6287844 citizens put down your torches and pitchforks we dont need them
6287845 no this a serious matter which we need to investigate further let us wait until we have proof that we have a werewolf
6287846 no need to investigate further we have proof that we have a werewolf
6287847 it isnt going to make the slightest difference no matter what i say is it
6287848 burn the werewolf guildmaster and bake cookies from cloth whilst wearing a tomato on your ear
6287849 we dont want white people smell what they act like so dont piss amp smear feces on their cars amp on the doors of the fine buildings they work at and on the downtown streets where they work for for white people to know what their behavior smells like there would be no where left for them to walk in america

6287856 i like it i would do it for free it is alot of fun it is hard to describe its just the most fun you could have up there because it is very intense you get an adreline rush from it
6287857 all these crops need to be sprayed at a certain time timing is everything and the pressue is very great for about 2 months time the most rewarding is seeing a patron produce a good crop without any damages to that crop
6287858 in about 3 to 4 minutes they can load 250 gallons of water mix the chemical and of course add 25 gallons of fuel
6287859 we would come in at 10 30 at night do some book work and get up at 4 30 in the morning and go again

6287866 i looked at his start and just went wow guys that tall should not be able to start like that he used every ounce of energy he wanted that record
6287867 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site here in poland that will help us to deal with long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6287868 and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted
6287869 i just want to welcome you to the socialist republic of utah
6287870 being surrounded by colleges and in the heart of harvard square means students are a constant flow

6287877 she taught all of my kids it was her life she was a professional woman who didnt have a family of her own the people of the church were her family
6287878 she had high expectations of herself the motto of presbyterians was to do everything decently and in order that was margaret
6287879 she was a god fearing lady and she was a lady
6287880 she told me that her favorite bible verse was god is love and she truly believed that and lived her life as though god is love

6287884 i think you will see some new passing with this change
6287885 its a tough corner because youre going from the fastest section of the track to the slowest but it should be good we were really quick at the test and thats always a good sign there were several things we were able to work on but overall the speed was there
6287886 eliminating the bend to the left and now going up the drag strip makes for a wider passing opportunity and i think thats good
6287887 any passing opportunity is great for the series and good for the fans that come out and watch
6287888 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6287889 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6287890 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6287891 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6287892 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6287893 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6287894 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6287895 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
6287896 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
6287897 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
6287898 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
6287899 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
6287900 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6287901 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6287902 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6287903 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6287904 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6287905 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6287906 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6287907 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6287908 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6287909 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6287910 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6287911 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6287912 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6287913 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6287914 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6287915 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6287916 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6287917 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6287918 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6287919 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
6287920 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
6287921 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6287922 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6287923 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6287924 im probably in that bubble of denial that you get in when youre involved in television but the truth of the matter is i gave her all i had all my life so theres no harm in not having been there for the final moments
6287925 there is no cash in the social security trust fund and there never has been any
6287926 the money to repay the ious will have to come from the general taxes the taxes that are being used today to pay for other government programs the most important date for social security is 2018 when taxpayers must begin to repay the ious not 2042 when the trust fund is exhausted
6287927 heres the problem with the south main and country club road crossings their angle is extreme because the tracks run nearly parallel to the road a rider must swing out and cross perpendicular to the tracks in the case of these two tracks swing out means swerving into oncoming traffic country club and swinging out and across two to three lanes of busy traffic south main
6287928 within just a few months left in office president bush is still doing the bidding of social conservatives who oppose womens reproductive freedoms
6287929 the potential impact of this new rule on the more than 500 000 hospital family planning clinics and medical offices that receive any form of federal funding could be dramatic
6287930 the draft proposed rule highlights the fact that many antiabortion groups also oppose one good method of preventing the unplanned pregnancies that lead to abortions birth control at some point in their lives 98 percent of u s women use birth control
6287931 the same protection for the convictions of other members of the population most notably patients the tremendous disparity in beliefs regarding health care also supports government regulation that accommodates all religious and personal views and practices to the greatest extent possible while preventing harm to others
6287932 those who are afraid to take a chance and those who are afraid not to
6287933 so you try to get the nature of things not an exact replica
6287934 he freed himself up thats not easy and its to his credit that he did that
6287935 find out who am i to be in the position to make me feel so damn unpretty
6287936 take it or leave it bahala ka sa buhay mo kung ayaw mo basta ako magiging ako
6287937 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6287938 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6287939 can such a belligerent state be trusted as the guarantor of europes energy supply
6287940 i have long supported a systematic and streamlined approach to loan modifications to put borrowers into long term sustainable mortgages achieving an improved return for bankers and investors compared to foreclosure
6287941 i think a lot of the mortgage lenders will frankly welcome the initiative
6287942 there are a lot of mortgages out there where foreclosure will be the best outcome
6287943 it will be interesting to see how this experiment will turn out
6287944 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes
6287945 many thousands of dedicated civil servants that are dedicated to making this nation a better place to live who serve their nation admirably and with dedication
6287946 has mutated into a no accountability zone where employment is treated as an entitlement good performance as an option and accountability as someone elses problem
6287947 generally positive rhetoric tinged with the old reagan attacks on lazy feds mccains comments are standard fed bashing
6287948 obama is concerned by the rising number of government contractors that are often unaccountable and frequently less efficient than government workers
6287949 reduce our nations increasing dependence on private contractors in sensitive or inherently governmental functions
6287950 eliminate the bush administrations ideological bias towards outsourcing of government services
6287951 labor leaders looking to swell the ranks of federal government unions
6287952 whereas mccain has the assumption that the private sector would do things better i dont think thats true
6287953 while hillcrest labs has a great deal of respect for nintendo and the wii hillcrest labs believes that nintendo is in clear violation of its patents and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights
6287954 we have not been served with any lawsuit or other action by hillcrest and therefore have no comment
6287955 it could happen but the stakes would be so high that nintendo wouldnt let it happen
6287956 the reality of it is one of two things is going to happen either theres no merit to hillcrests suit and theyll lose or nintendo will settle
6287957 you can describe multiple products in your patent application and the fact that you dont describe the exact same product thats not the key
6287958 by 1997 i had logged more time on telephone holds with the irs listening to a constantly repeating nutcracker suite than have most irs employees
6287959 while the irs is reforming some aspects of its approach to identity theft its procedures for dealing with victims have been a significant part of the problem
6287960 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6287961 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6287962 youre worried about the future here people have gone through very tough times
6287963 when youve got entire industries that have shipped overseas when youve got thousands of jobs being lost thats tough
6287964 its going to be tough territory for barack obama to win
6287965 but the goal is to get as many votes as you possibly can every vote is one vote closer to carrying virginia
6287966 it doesnt take a lot of courage to go to martinsville and talk about trade what would be courageous is to come to
6287967 see how it goes and then once we get healthy well make a decision and maybe go back
6287968 we are examining the order and will evaluate our next step
6287969 we are in a trial and final results of that are yet unknown which is why we do trials
6287970 the important point is that the intent of network management has and continues to be to provide a great experience for our customers
6287971 inconsistent with the concept of an open and accessible internet
6287972 another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
6287973 the framework we adopt today will send a message to the industry that bad actors will be punished
6287974 ive been farming for 39 years and i havent seen a better year than this one
6287975 people on the east coast and west coast are seeing their food bill rise well a lot of that increase is ending up here
6287976 i dont think we can rule out a government intervention fannie and freddie are crucial to stabilizing the housing market and the housing market is crucial to stabilizing the banks and the financial services industry
6287977 given where the prices are trading at i dont see anything but a government bailout at this point
6287978 the market is telling you that the government is going to step in its almost a self fulfilling prophesy
6287979 dass das unternehmen schlecht performt ist eine berraschung schlie lich hat das whole foods konzept sowohl in hinblick auf die frische der waren und deren pr sentation als auch in der schaffung der einkaufsatmosph re f r europ ische handelsketten vorbildcharakter
6287980 wir sehen zum ersten mal seit jahren dass der konsum von bio lebensmitteln zur ckgeht wenn die finanzielle situation schwieriger wird berlegen sich die menschen sehr genau wof r sie ihr geld ausgeben
6287981 it was very close and i still cant believe i won it
6287982 the crowd helped me very much and i am very excited to be in the quarterfinals
6287983 these kinds of matches for the last year or so i was losing them
6287984 at some point it makes a difference because you have confidence from these kind of matches and you build up from there
6287985 i lost my rhythm a little bit on my serve because of the wind in the first set
6287986 i couldnt find it in the second as well but still i was fighting to the end and im pleased with this win
6287987 i am so happy with my level of play today
6287988 i always play well here in new haven and i am hoping to play my best
6287989 i was serving and volleying and then i tried to stay back and wear him down it worked
6287990 i was hitting everything for a winner and everything was going 100 percent my way
6287991 when the match kind of got tight in a couple of points i started to panic maybe a little bit
6287992 he is a tough opponent but i played a pretty clean match for me
6287993 i served really well i took my opportunities when i had them
6287994 i dont think that the moratorium on offshore drilling or the drilling in the inner mountain pass for oil shale should be continued
6287995 there is no reason for that ban to be extended
6287996 the american people will not support those moratoria in the future and i am hopeful that the legislation in the house will not continue them
6287997 we will see if it actually happens and whether congress will actually pass it its a long way off and we will cross that bridge when we get it
6287998 i think our focus ought to be on congress preventing that from occurring
6287999 det r en fr jd att vara n ra leoparder

6288003 the dncc community credentials incorporate patriotic design elements they do not depict an actual american flag
6288004 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6288005 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6288006 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6288007 we are seeing worldwide persecution of christians as part of the radical muslim mission to
6288008 the governments of the world must be pressured to demand that the u n adopt a clear resolution or law that categorically prohibits affronts to prophets to the prophets of the lord and his messengers to his holy books and to the religious holy places
6288009 objectively speaking the cartoon controversy was a tempest in a teacup but subjectively it was a show of strength and in the context of the clash of civilizations a dress rehearsal for the real thing the muslims demonstrated how quickly and effectively they can mobilize the masses and the free west showed that it has nothing to counter the offensive nothing but fear cowardice and an overriding concern about the balance of trade now the islamists know that they are dealing with a paper tiger whose roar is nothing but a tape recording
6288010 the media must transform diversity which is a fact of life into pluralism which is a set of values getting diversity accepted is the role of the education system and acceptance is the role of the law promoting and defending diversity is the task of the media societies must recognize accept and promote diversity

6288015 he corsi claims to have 700 footnotes and yet he gets some of the most basic facts about barack obama wrong
6288016 well john edwards claims his affair started when elizabeths cancer was in remission
6288017 although mr corsi includes nearly 700 citations in his book he still manages to get many of the basic facts wrong
6288018 but corsi makes more troubling inaccurate claims as well such as saying that obama gave a million dollars to a kenyan politician
6288019 the funding memo listed seventy two top individuals and organizations allegedly contributing to odingas presidential campaign including over 1 million from friends of senator bo widely interpreted as friends of senator barack obama

6288054 in some cases there are costs benefits to outsourcing enterprise email but in all cases it frees up it resources
6288055 there will be functionality fall out between the premise based gear and the cloud based service
6288056 but thats not unique to email and those problems will get resolved over time
6288057 with email in the cloud youre not going to get that synchronization between voice and email messages
6288058 a lot of the security problems we see with email will increase with im voip and cell phones said carol baroudi senior research analyst of security technologies at aberdeen group and author of internet for dummies and email for dummies
6288059 we need to pull the messaging stream together to have a better shot at protecting any and all of it from everything from botnets and viruses to cell phone spam
6288060 more than 200 million machines have been infected and all fortune 500 companies have infected machines
6288061 most organizations are often ill served with in house email
6288062 once an organization outsources its email it is relatively easy to later add additional features such as team collaboration enterprise instant messaging voice over ip web audio and video conferencing email archiving and ediscovery etc all as part of an integrated solution from the same provider
6288063 you can track traffic across different users networks and domains which make it easier to detect threats than just looking at one machine at a time
6288064 its good to have some threats removed before they land
6288065 its increasing adoption by many leading and up and coming service providers
6288066 this first version of photosynth has some limitations that you need to be aware of
6288067 in part we are making them responsible for a previous owners irresponsibility which led to calls for service and unfortunately a fatality

6288070 minor changes required the outsourcing of services to our third party web master
6288071 it seemed a lot more legitimate than just paying the money and having to figure it out on your own
6288072 we have over 3 000 products at this time seventy five percent of them could have a price increase two times a year
6288073 some customers would have the new site on their browser and others would not

6288079 he didnt kill a kid he didnt give it to the kid he passed a paper he was not the one to put it on the kid
6288080 if i had a gun i would shoot you both
6288081 the kid has had one hell of a terrible life
6288082 he had mental problems serious mental problems thank god none of them were to kill or to beat somebody up
6288083 hes a young man whos had problems all his life
6288084 hes made mistakes but he doesnt really understand what you should do and shouldnt do
6288085 i think that the punishment needs to be more severe for people if they find the people behind this i dont think they should be allowed to walk around they should be jailed
6288086 it goes without saying that safety and the well being of our customers and employees is our first priority
6288087 we have a proactive and vigilant security team together with the salem police department and were confident that they will be continue to provide the environment our customers respect
6288088 i was a little creeped out that we had a bomb threat
6288089 new hampshire needs leaders in concord who understand that our economy and our quality of life are directly linked to the health of our environment
6288090 through words and action john lynch has proven himself to be a friend of the new hampshire environment and a protector of our quality of life
6288091 as governor it has been my highest priority to make sure we are doing everything we can as a state to look out for the people of new hampshire not just right now but for generations to come
6288092 its believed boww was formed to protect and prevent the extortion of white inmates by other security threat groups
6288093 jesse has been bouncing around in the judicial system for many years yes
6288094 but you tell me that rehabilitating a person is throwing them in a 6 by 6 cell
6288095 weve got to get better because you never stay the same you get better or worse
6288096 they were good last year and gave us everything we wanted last year with a backup quarterback
6288097 hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6288098 i think weve been on our heels definitely these last two preseason games
6288099 not from the scoreboard but just from the play within the games were behind and we need to pick it up
6288100 it looked like a completely different team out there against tampa bay and how they were ready and we werent they treated it like a game and we went out there treating it as a scrimmage
6288101 so we cant do anything about that we have to get better as a team without him
6288102 im not saying i went out there and every run was the best i ran hard and did the best with the carries i had but i still have room to get better
6288103 from the towns perspective our motivation has to be the integrity and preservation of main street businesses in adverse economic times
6288104 maybe they could work seven days a week from april to the end of june
6288105 the plan recognizes that main street will be open to two way traffic
6288106 i cant find the words to explain how happy we are
6288107 a lot of it was debris removal trees in the road
6288108 we had a stretch of town road that was just buried in trees maybe 1 000 feet long
6288109 it looks like somebody just dropped a whole bunch of trees down in matchstick fashion its just impossible for anything but squirrels to get through
6288110 its done on a county basis not on a town basis
6288111 any rational person handing out aid for disasters would help epsom because its been clobbered so many times but its in merrimack county and merrimack county didnt suffer so bad
6288112 these communities experienced a tremendous amount of damage during the tornado
6288113 and this assistance will help these towns rebuild their infrastructure
6288114 for overlooking the literal interpretation of what is required for a disaster designation and for his willingness to reexamine the damage that was inflicted upon merrimack and strafford counties
6288115 its clear that a number of communities in these counties suffered significant damage from the july 24th tornado and storms and i am pleased that merrimack and strafford counties will be receiving assistance
6288116 weve been showcasing joe and its time well spent because people wont give to someone they dont know weve spent our time wisely
6288117 we intend to have a very strong financial committee following the primary
6288118 were taking nothing for granted were running a full campaign to reach out and talk to voters about what gov lynch has accomplished
6288119 as we look to the future we must continue to strengthen the process and ensure a fair process in which the diverse voices in our party and our nation have a chance to be heard
6288120 that is the essential role that the democratic change commission can and will play and we look forward to their recommendations
6288121 we have been assured that no specific state has been given a preference as far as a time for their primary or their caucus in this resolution
6288122 we want to look at ways to ensure that voters decide who the nominee is and not party insiders
6288123 one of my guys said today new hampshire is alive and well for growth companies were pleased to be part of the inc 5000
6288124 i think well be higher on the inc 5000 next year
6288125 we had decided the best thing for nitro was to remain private and try to raise private funds
6288126 someday we hope to back on the public markets but as a much bigger company
6288127 the core differentiator to our security information and event management technology
6288128 nitrosecurity is well positioned to address the major network security challenges that organizations of all shapes and sizes face today protecting their networks from the growing number of information security threats and then managing and making sense of the massive amounts of associated threat data
6288129 when im out there boarding it takes the disability away from my mind and gives me more of my freedom
6288130 i owe a lot to this program it saved my life
6288131 two weeks later i joined my unit in iraq thirty three days later i was paralyzed by a mortar blast id still be there but they dont have hand controls to drive a humvee yet
6288132 being disabled knocks you upside down and sideways at the same time
6288133 my body stopped accepting blood after 50 transfusions and 30 operations
6288134 theres a lot of mental frustration and the disability can get into your head
6288135 sitting around recovering isnt doing much for me i want to go back to work
6288136 ive learned the only limit to what i can do is what i choose not to do i just have to find a different way to do it
6288137 activity wise im doing more than ive done in my whole life and im 39
6288138 i got nervous about facing a bunch of my fears and left having achieved all of my goals
6288139 taking pain pills every day wasnt what i wanted to do with the rest of my life
6288140 now i find myself looking forward to the next challenge
6288141 i dont know this group yet but know that by the end of the weekend ill shed some tears of joy watching them
6288142 most people dont know how tough it is for these young people with families to all of the sudden find themselves dealing with a life changing injury in a war no one loves its wonderful to be a supportive part of their story
6288143 its just great knowing i am doing what the able bodied can do
6288144 and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
6288145 erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront evil when we see it
6288146 abide by that basic precept in the book of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
6288147 weve had a president who is opposed to abortions over the last eight years and abortions have not gone down
6288148 taken to the soiled utility room and left alone to die
6288149 a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
6288150 just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
6288151 i wanted to buy back america and lease it to the whites
6288152 sweating the small stuff inner city schools and the new paternalism
6288153 everyone says we should preserve our culture there is a lot of our culture we should wipe out
6288154 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6288155 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6288156 das ist sehr sinnvoll im interesse der patienten und der kliniken man muss dann nicht mehr von tamsweg oder mittersill wegen der nachsorge bei einer operation nach salzburg fahren wenn das genausogut in zell am see oder anderswo in innergebirg durchgef hrt werden kann
6288157 kinder unter vier jahren werden nur bei extremen einzelf llen operiert und wenn mandeln nicht entz ndet sondern nur ein physikalisches hindernis sind dann entfernen wir sie nicht mehr ganz sondern verkleinern sie auf normale gr e
6288158 no i think i just come off that way sometimes i really dont want to act like i do it just happens i really do like you
6288159 were approaching retirement in the next six to seven years
6288160 if theres not enough faculty not enough courses we have a de facto enrollment cap
6288161 the school that i want to go to is a state school but its 17 000 a semester
6288162 not to gamble on such a young and inexperienced writer
6288163 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6288164 then we were placed in a house the kids were allowed to go to school and a normal life began
6288165 we as americans i think are good people and want to believe that our family courts do a good job of protecting children
6288166 and so we close our eyes real tight in order to keep on believing that
6288167 im whiny and i cry easily and hes smiley and happy and pats everyone on the back and hes everyones friend when you meet him
6288168 i just started rattling off everything ive seen in movies
6288169 lets have all the evidence come out before fair people in minneapolis
6288170 if they find her guilty then they punish her if they find her not guilty then leave her alone
6288171 she gana this same gorilla had a female baby in 2007 that now lives at the stuttgart zoo
6288172 shoot for the moon even if you fail youll land among the stars
6288173 worship in a one to one correlation with a feeling and if if you feel a certain way god showed up and it was a good worship
6288174 every head bowed every eye closed lift your hand if you want to commit your life to christ i see those hands
6288175 if someone is reluctant to commit their life to christ but they think others are doing it then theyll be emboldened to do it as well
6288176 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
6288177 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6288178 displayed a disturbing ignorance of the realities of the wests scarce water resources
6288179 senator mccain believes as i do that a compact thats been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go states are the ones who build these kinds of understandings the federal government shouldnt meddle in that compact
6288180 meteors bumpy road watch out 30 000 miles ahead saturn look out for martians space
6288181 writing in the early twentieth century mangasarian had adopted the prevalent stance of his time that quirinius was ruler of syria at a d 6 this is historically correct it is indeed the date that josephus lists as the time quirinius was governor since at the time of mangasarians writing josephus record was the only mention of quirinius ever being governor of syria mangasarian made the incorrect conclusion that the gospel accounts were in conflict with each other because history of that time knew for certain that herod reigned in judea around 7 b c and that quirinius reigned in syria around a d 6 this accounts for his charge of a fourteen year variance between lukes account of christs birth and matthews however it is now known that quirinius was governor of syria on two separate occasions once in a d 6 as josephus testified and again in 7 b c reigning simultaneously with herod as shown by objective archaeological evidence an inscription found in antioch ascribing quirinius to this post mangasarian refers to the known date of quirinius second term as governor his first term was at 7 b c during the reign of herod therefore the accounts of luke and matthew concerning jesus birth would seem historically correct verifiable by independent sources and in complete agreement
6288182 if our current state of life is in fact existing because of the big bang then would it be possible for other big bangs to occur
6288183 ultra dense ultra hot singularity that defies the conceptual laws of physics
6288184 would it be correct to think that we are not alone in this infinite universe
6288185 if our universe is always in a state of expansion then what is it expanding against
6288186 among christians of all ages and of varying shades of doctrinal emphasis there has been fairly full agreement on one thing they all believed that it was important that the christian with serious spiritual aspirations should learn to meditate long and often on god
6288187 let a christian insist upon rising above the poor average of current religious experience and he will soon come up against the need to know god himself as the ultimate goal of all christian doctrine let him seek to explore the sacred wonders of the triune godhead and he will discover that sustained and intelligently directed meditation on the person of god is imperative to know god well he must think on him unceasingly nothing that man has discovered about himself or god has revealed any short cut to pure spirituality it is still free but tremendously costly
6288188 damn girl that is a big ol ass on ya it should be stowed in the overhead bin
6288189 see what you can get away with when you are gay

6288194 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6288195 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6288196 we think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry naked and homeless the poverty of being unwanted unloved and uncared for is the greatest poverty we must start in our own homes to remedy this kind of poverty
6288197 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic p recept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me and notion of that basic principle applies to poverty
6288198 gusto lang namin ng tahimik na buhay i mean pag nasa labas kami gusto namin sa amin lang yon wag na kaming guluhin ng ibang tao kasi pinakiusapan namin nang mabuti si ate member ng tv crew na nag iinterbyu sa amin na huwag na kaming interbyuhin pero kasi makulit siya talaga e wag niyang ibe blame si dennis na bastos or something na uminit ang ulo kasi kinausap namin siya nang maayos
6288199 kung ano yung nakikita nila na sasabihin nila na hindi proud or whatever hindi po ako naaapektuhan doon personal na buhay namin ito di ba saka andito kami sa business na ito para sa work hindi para ilathala ng tao yung private life namin
6288200 bago ko tanggapin si dennis tanggap ko na siyempre yung sitwasyon niya ang sama ko naman kung magiging selfish ako di ba so wala pong problema sa akin kung hati man ang ang tingin ng ibang tao kasi sa akin parang hindi nga hati e equal lang lahat
6288201 e di good at least di ba para wala nang tama na yung away away na ganun ganun at least tama na tama na yon
6288202 syempre nirerepseto ko naman si carlene dahil nanay siya ni calix di ba and ayoko namang makigulo dun lalo na kung may ibang tao na ayaw naman akong pumunta doon
6288203 if si dennis oo coz share sila ni carlene at okey naman sila pero si cristine never
6288204 viens que je te sacre un coup de pied sur le tibia et que je te regarde courir un peu juste pour voir
6288205 i am more bullish than bearish i think the market has too quickly discounted geopolitical risks and was too concerned with demand destruction we should be trending back towards 120 125 a barrel
6288206 do not burn yourselves out be as i am a reluctant enthusiast a part time crusader a half hearted fanatic save the other half of yourselves and your lives for pleasure and adventure it is not enough to fight for the land it is even more important to enjoy it while you can while its still here so get out there and hunt and fish and mess around with your friends ramble out yonder and explore the forests climb the mountains bag the peaks run the rivers breathe deep of that yet sweet and lucid air sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness the lovely mysterious and awesome space enjoy yourselves keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body the body active and alive and i promise you this much i promise you this one sweet victory over those desk bound men with their hearts in a safe deposit box and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators i promise you this you will outlive the bastards
6288207 there was once a time when americans came west to discover their destiny today they seem to move around every which where restless and unsettled but i think theyre still looking for the same thing a place where they can be optimistic about their future a place that helps them be who they really want to be where they can feel that this life makes sense a place that they can feel what i feel when im here because when im here all i feel is free

6288209 is more interested in conserving and recycling minerals than in digging up new ones it seeks alternatives to mining not its expansion
6288210 meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
6288211 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6288212 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6288213 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6288214 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6288215 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6288216 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6288217 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6288218 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6288219 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6288220 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6288221 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6288222 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6288223 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6288224 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6288225 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6288226 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6288227 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6288228 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6288229 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6288230 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6288231 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6288232 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6288233 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick

6288235 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6288236 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6288237 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

6288241 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping

6288245 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6288246 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

6288253 i just registered it today how do you know it is out of warranty i bought it 8 months ago
6288254 i know because the computer is telling me your warranty expired in june 2008
6288255 well assuming the warranty is expired will you repair this hardware defect which revealed itself 2 months after expiration
6288256 hello sir bob has explained to me you have a problem with your 360 which is out of warranty
6288257 well i dont know if it is out of warranty but i do have a problem
6288258 how do you know whether it expired in april or june
6288259 but now ive spoken with two different people who each gave me a different expiration date is it possible both are wrong
6288260 yes it is possible but you must prove the console under warranty
6288261 isnt it your job if you say it is not
6288262 no sir our computer says it is not so now it is your turn what would you like me to do
6288263 well i would like you to use the brain g d gave you and think independent of the computer
6288264 i am sorry sir i am not authorized to do that
6288265 well it will be 99 usd and a lot of time for the repair or 150 usd for a refurb in the store
6288266 i agree but what would you like to do no sir what do you suggest i do i cannot allow a free repair what would you do
6288267 i would tell my boss the console market is very competitive and if one of competitors is treating repairs this way we should consider giving level 2 support authority to extend a warranty for known issues

6288270 when they get us into the eighth inning it gives us a chance to give our bullpen a smaller task the starters have taken us to another level when you are struggling in the bullpen which is what we have done periodically its more important that you get good starting pitching

6288296 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6288297 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6288298 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6288299 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect

6288317 if steve mcclaren had been in charge of that team there would have been uproar wembley would have gone barmy
6288318 ive not seen a fabio capello team play worse than that
6288319 some of the players are not recognisable from the ones who play week in week out in the prem
6288320 he has to be in the middle of the pitch and be part of the game i was full of optimism before the game but its difficult to be optimistic after that
6288321 gerrard wasnt playing on the left we played 4 3 2 1 we played defoe gerrard and rooney and three midfielders behind them mr redknapp has to express something but gerrard didnt play on the left
6288322 sorry youll have to ask the player he didnt play left the movement he went to the left and to the middle he never played on the left
6288323 im happy with the draw because of the reaction from the team in the last minute was good
6288324 only one thing i didt like when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered we have to combat that problem
6288325 it was a good recruiting year for us and that was our no 1 goal in january
6288326 talent wise and number wise we feel good about it it outnumbers the returners and thats an interesting roster mix by sheer numbers many of the younger guys are in the two deep
6288327 there will be quite a few young guys playing for us one because they have to and two some of them are good enough to do it as well
6288328 we want to be as balanced as possible wed like to be 50 50 run pass we think we have to have that balance to keep defenses on their heels
6288329 there will be a lot of different formations and a lot of different looks
6288330 were mostly out of the pro i but we have empty sets we have three back sets and four wide receiver sets its a big change coming from being an option team its a lot harder for us to pick up but itll be hard for the defense to pick up our playbook is about an inch and a half thick
6288331 the key to the defense is flying to the ball
6288332 we want to get all 11 guys to the ball were going to attack on every single play
6288333 ending on that win its going to be a lot better this year
6288334 we feel compelled to let buckeye fans know that there is only one way you would be guaranteed to get the big ten network in time to see us take the field against youngstown state and that is to call one of the providers now carrying the network in the state
6288335 it is a shame that due to time warners decision nearly all michigan fans have the network but buckeye fans do not

6288342 i pretty much threw the fastball wherever i wanted to when you do that it can make your other pitches better i think i pitched better tonight than i did any time this year it shows me the work im doing is paying off
6288343 he came down and said he thought he was going to take me out
6288344 what he did more than anything else was he stayed out of the middle of the plate so he could keep the ball off the fat part of their bats
6288345 when they did center it up we had someone standing there to catch it
6288346 pitches over the middle of the plate belt high they lead to extra base hits
6288347 its all about starting pitching and tonight our starter had a tough outing
6288348 its been very inconsistent all year long it was a pitch i could always have success with but its not doing much it spins up there stays up over the plate and it gets whacked three of the home runs i gave up tonight were on that pitch

6288375 our experience has been and its drawn principally from iraq that when you are in an area for a while people will eventually come to trust you they rely on your security they will give you intelligence and expect you to continue to provide that security

6288426 cela ne fonctionne tout simplement pas ajoute marco haller le know how des tudiants nest pas pris en compte cest tr s dommage
6288427 pour linstant un travail de lobbying destin faire conna tre le point de vue de lunes aux personnes qui ont r pondu la consultation est en cours
6288428 cela d pend un peu de l tat o se trouve le projet de loi r pond marco haller nous avons parl avec des partis politiques avec des parlementaires avec la crus afin de nous faire entendre
6288429 nous nen sommes pas encore l constate sabin nater dans bien des hautes coles sp cialis es les associations d tudiants sont en construction nous essayons de rendre les tudiants attentifs ces questions politiques nombre dentre eux ne sont pas encore du tout sensibilis s malgr cela je suis confiante pour lavenir
6288430 cest encore un norme chantier sabin nater m ne un travail de terrain part la rencontre des gens la question du lobbying se posera pour plus tard

6288436 25 30 heures de travail dans les universit s et 30 dans les hes il y a une in galit
6288437 cette loi aurait t une occasion grandiose de r gler la question des bourses d tudes soupire marco haller mais il semble que c tait le mauvais endroit pour le faire

6288464 theres no question that rising fuel prices have been driving utility bills higher
6288465 they cant just say coal went up so give us money
6288466 they have to prove what theyre saying if its a cost of fuel its documented and theyre buying it they have a right to request for a rate increase
6288467 what is true is that we dont have adequate infrastructure
6288468 the whole reason electricity has been affordable as a utility not a luxury is that we could get it to as many people as possible all the time that totally depends on generating it in one place and moving it to another

6288506 can claim with gratitude a good number of lobbyists as friends and supporters
6288507 mccains rhetoric about lobbyists is so disconnected from reality that the real birds of prey are the ones descending on his credibility and former maverick image
6288508 john mccain has so many lobbyists running and raising money for his campaign that job applicants apparently need to show their lobbyist disclosure forms to get in the door john mccains desperate and misleading rhetoric cant change the fact that he represents more of the same broken washington politics
6288509 having worked in washington for so long i can claim with gratitude a good number of lobbyists as friends and supporters many of whom supported my presidential campaign
6288510 i would like to say another word about lobbyists lobbying is an honorable profession i have no problem with it i have no problem with people working in order to bring the peoples interests and agenda and priorities to the attention of congress almost all of us who i know of rely on their input on various issues many supply us with policy papers with data et cetera

6288532 it doesnt cost money to play you just need a ball and a field all of the children in this region can come to this stadium and play a game
6288533 hundreds of ramadi citizens have told me they would dream of seeing the stadium return to its past glory and to be able to play soccer there again
6288534 they thought that dream would never come true but with the help of 1st battalion 9th marines and other coalition forces throughout the years the stadium was rebuilt and their dreams have been fulfilled
6288535 the insurgents made it so that the north couldnt be with the south and so on but now with the aid of this tournament the city has come back together
6288536 this stadium will give the children an alternative to being on the streets
6288537 it will give the students somewhere positive to channel their energy
6288538 the iraqi police did a great job posting security for the tournament
6288539 the iraqi police have learned that with every new marine battalion that comes to the city the expectations for the police will increase i think theyve met those expectations
6288540 at first it was mostly iraqi police in attendance but every day the crowd has almost doubled on the last day the stadium was filled with families and people young and old male and female
6288541 the tournament had a couple of concession stands open and a few local vendors sold popsicles and other treats in the stands
6288542 it was much like a sporting event you would go to in the united states
6288543 i cant find a strong enough word to show our thanks for what the marines have done for not only the iraqi police but all of the citizens of ramadi

6288560 its great that the city was able to get this school opened up
6288561 the school is going to be a wonderful institution not only for the students but for all of ramadi as the youth of the city continue to earn an education they will assist the city and the province in making their country prosperous
6288562 all of the bullet holes in the walls from the fighting were patched up along with several other refurbishments the building required almost floor to ceiling reconstruction
6288563 this school will allow young people from all across al anbar to come and learn a trade it also has the added benefit of getting the young males off the streets and giving them something productive to do this school will give them opportunity to become functioning members of society
6288564 school starts in september here so the timing was right on to prepare the students and staff for the new school season

6288607 this is the second reduction in fixed rate home loan interest rates by the commonwealth bank since 11 august 2008 and reflects the recent reduction in wholesale funding costs for our fixed rate home loans the bank said
6288608 the rba has not announced any reduction in the official cash rate at this time and we cannot speculate on what they will do commonwealth said in a statement today

6288617 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor

6288862 it addresses the field itself it enhances the field significantly makes it an area where pedestrians or people walking wherever they are coming from have some area where they can enjoy whats there already the resch center lambeau field and now this new stadium
6288863 what it really does for us long term is it gives us our primary training camp field which would be in a safer section again on the other side of the hutson center with better stands that sit up higher we can seat more people so we have less people standing or needing to bring lawn chairs
6288864 i would say that spending this much money on a lease and as much as well spend on fields well be here for the entire term of this lease

6288876 the promise and the hope and the dream of getting to go after the medal one more time is definitely what i love
6288877 the journey living out the dream is the best part of it
6288878 this is it im going to enjoy it first or fifth or whatever place
6288879 im kinda old so we have these aches and pains
6288880 its holding its fine my last entry was great so i have to be confident that i can use it even though its sore
6288881 this is the first time ive gone to prelims with her that i didnt have a heart attack
6288882 these are the little nagging things that really suck up your time
6288883 for what i consider my time is worth per hour what they save adds up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the long run i can give my undivided attention to my job
6288884 when you look at something as simple as scheduling an appointment it can take as many as four to five calls or e mails
6288885 these things always add up to about eight hours or a days work
6288886 its like having a three day weekend every week for the rest of your life
6288887 the payoff in terms of breathing room to focus on the things you want to do is incredible but i think that right now most people are not aware that this possibility exists they assume its a script for a comedy but its a very real option
6288888 if you look at the people who use these sites for personal reasons they arent likely to stop doing what theyre doing because of inflation
6288889 i tend to be competitive when it comes to bidding and it becomes totally insane
6288890 i end up spending twice the amount i wanted to because i am emotionally attached having someone else bid for me saves me not only money but time and anxiety i know they are looking for the best deal
6288891 ultimately time is the most valuable nonrenewable resource that we have
6288892 the focus on better allocation of money means a greater opportunity for india
6288893 in an ideal world we would get it to the point where there would be no barriers
6288894 there have been complaints from time to time but those have been modest
6288895 now i see why ive only been to certain parts of this tunnel
6288896 if these buildings and these tunnels are open to the public they should be ada compliant
6288897 a public accommodation shall remove architectural barriers in existing facilities including communication barriers that are structural in nature where such removal is readily achievable i e easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense
6288898 our buildings including jpmorgan chase tower are handicap accessible at the locations that were designed and constructed per the city of houston building codes including handicap accessible routes that provide access to the tunnel system
6288899 i can go from the four seasons to allen center for a dental appointment without encountering a barrier

6288909 i saw a dog run off a dock into the water a sport called dock jumping
6288910 ive made more friends in this sport than i did playing the other sport for in the big leagues for 16 years people like me for who i am not what i do it wasnt like that in baseball
6288911 some people bring their dogs and just assume they will swim its one thing to assume a lab will swim its another to assume a lhasa apso will
6288912 so many dogs are under exercised some just say well feed overweight dogs less ok that may be a part of the solution but just as in people so is exercise
6288913 you never know people can be crazy wanting to live their lives through their dogs were not the olympics
6288914 i challenge michael phelps to jump and dive as far as seven and i know sparky anderson can out dog paddle him
6288915 if it literally does take longer to approve review and fund a transit program than it did to put a man on the moon then houston has a problem but so does the rest of the nation
6288916 if you talk to the professionals in the engineering community they will tell you that this is just a small portion of what is really needed
6288917 the real numbers are upwards of two billion or three billion the important thing with this fund is that were not taking money from the general revenue fund we are allocating money that we do collect and putting it in this dedicated fund before it goes somewhere else
6288918 ive always said i think we can find funding to get the projects done without a tax
6288919 historically the city was spending between 20 and 30 million a year on drainage most of which had to do with removing obstructions to the flow
6288920 in 2004 15 million was dedicated to that in funding although 25 30 million was budgeted so we ran out of money
6288921 we get a lot of pooling especially during the storm season and the rainy season and whenever weve got some tropical depressions coming
6288922 we see a lot of water trapped in our neighborhoods that cant get to the bayou system
6288923 if we keep doing things like weve done over the last 50 100 years and we keep growing then were going to see worse and worse flooding problems
6288924 but i dont want to be somebody who just points fingers and says it is somebody elses job the city wants to play its part
6288925 i think people should be able to tough it out if its really about improving the quality of life
6288926 my guess is this would be ripe for a decision within a month
6288927 my concern as ive said from the beginning is that this not cost the taxpayers
6288928 uh downtown has undergone a dramatic transformation but were still referred to as a branch campus

6288931 those who are most vocal in the discussion on outsourcing are benefitting the most by being liaisons within corporations or by taking advantage as entrepreneurs since they are making a ton of money from offshoring it should be no surprise that they are promoting it but just because the vocal portion of the indian american community supports outsourcing doesnt mean that a majority of the community supports it i have received many emails from indians in america who are being squeezed by outsourcing second what is good for india isnt automatically good for the indian american community or vice versa
6288932 companies are bringing parts of their customer service back onshore and even in house because it is a key part of the customer experience

6288987 its more of a mental grind than it is physical
6288988 obviously your arm is going to go through some dead stages and get tired for sure
6288989 when youre out there and preparing yourself every day to compete your arm is going to get tired but its more of trying to keep yourself in it mentally more than a physical battle
6288990 its just a matter of like i said keeping yourself in it every day mentally and just trying to keep yourself prepared for those moments
6288991 its a situation where youve got one out to get
6288992 you concentrate on that hitter you know theres a lot of stuff going on behind you on the bases but right there youve just got to concentrate on getting that one guy at the plate you know if you can get him youve got a clean inning the next time so you really just focus in on that one batter at that moment
6288993 weve just got so many carries that i want to see him do during the preseason just to get his pads set and make sure his legs are ready and hes set for those full speed collisions he scrimmaged during training camp and hes been everything but tackled to the ground most of the time in training camp
6288994 we felt like we had a solid nucleus of players and what weve done is gone out and got some guys to make the group better
6288995 the thing thats really important to me is that they fit in very well weve talked a lot about being a great teammate and what exactly a great teammate is because the cohesiveness of our team is whats going to determine i think how successful we are this season
6288996 it wasnt easy for him he was grinding he wasnt as sharp as he has been his last couple starts but he made it it wasnt pretty by any means but he was effectively wild enough to keep guys off balance i was pleased more with our bullpen the way our bullpen came in and pitched
6288997 going into the game i thought we had one advantage and thats a lot for us
6288998 i thought it was patrick mills i thought he was someone their point guards would have trouble with
6288999 im glad my duke team doesnt play st marys this season
6289000 you could hear them talking out in the hall lets go

6289011 if heads dont roll you cant change the culture of this organization
6289012 the agency has aggressively targeted fraud and improper payments in the dme program we have a history of working closely with the inspector general and will continue to do so

6289015 lane is a minor who admitted to sergeant trego that he caused both fires in question in his own deposition lane indicated that although he did cause the fire he did not know if the fire was caused intentionally or negligently
6289016 we dont argue that the inspector used the probes as leverage to get into the aircraft
6289017 but terrorists would not be concerned if they broke a probe to gain access to a plane
6289018 the tsa inspector could not have gotten onto the sterile airfield area unless he used his id badge
6289019 he turner says hes not required to put it in his ethics statements but theres nothing to prevent him from putting it in his ethics statements
6289020 why not disclose what kind of toilet paper he uses where do you stop
6289021 then all theyve got to do is form a subsidiary and you can conceal anything
6289022 i hope the local democrats are doing more research than just reading the pot smokers magazine
6289023 in the last 14 months the ddn has run 9 articles based on misrepresentation and innuendo attacking my business even though i meet the highest standards for public disclosure and accountability its shameful
6289024 and because mrs turners business is that of communications and her web site is so complete in listing clients and core competencies i find it interesting that this subsidiary is never mentioned
6289025 it seems to represent at best a very serious error in judgment and quite possibly more than that
6289026 we suggest to home owners that just because they see an aircraft in the sky and it is waterbombing they shouldnt become complacent
6289027 there is a need if they are in a risk area to practise stay and defend or go early and to ensure they are well ahead of the fire in that regard
6289028 make sure youve cleared undergrowth away from fence lines and up to property lines ensure downpipes and guttering are clear and not clogged with leaf litter that for example stacks of firewood are not against the building proper
6289029 you dont want to look to the past you want to look to the next day and thats what im going to do
6289030 i was just falling behind hitters and not throwing enough strikes
6289031 it was a situation where balls werent going at people they were getting hits where when youre going good theyre being hit at somebody its just a matter of going out there and staying aggressive and get back to that point where im going right at them and getting ahead
6289032 its just by coincidence that lately i havent been pitching well at home
6289033 there is still a lot of room for improvement for the final
6289034 i know exactly what ive done wrong so i dont think its going to be something thats going to be hard to change for finals
6289035 when its really close you need to have a good final dive and i did it really well yesterday and this morning so its good
6289036 i dont have a placing that i really want to finish but i want to hit every single dive and if i do that ill be happy and a good score will come out of it

6289038 we absolutely opposed handing over the control of these tracks to the private sector but the national party presumably supported by the farmers federation went ahead with it

6289040 david lehmans oxford anthology is the single most important volume of american poetry in a generation
6289041 the book is not only a sound historical survey but also gives the reader a powerful taste of poetrys impact upon the wider world
6289042 indeed for the reader otherwise disinclined to pick up a volume of poetry you may also find yourself enjoying the selections in this collection
6289043 there is no one more qualified to undertake such a project
6289044 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6289045 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6289046 the reason for the survey is to get a broad cross section of employees to give their perceptions about the merger
6289047 are critical to running a great airline and our collective future success is dependent on their continued dedication to customer service
6289048 delta has long engaged employees in key business initiatives seeking their individual feedback on how to improve our operation and make delta a great place to work
6289049 the survey in itself is not positive or negative the issue here is the lack of trust in the northwest culture between unions and management
6289050 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6289051 before that meeting were going to get quite a few statements from opec officials expressing opinions in the end i dont expect a production cut but they may push for greater adherence to output quotas

6289053 if theres not enough faculty not enough courses we have a de facto enrollment cap
6289054 the school that i want to go to is a state school but its 17 000 a semester
6289055 there is heavy selling of dollars this morning to cap at 34 20
6289056 they are afraid that the baht will break 34 20 soon if it touches the said level so they started to sell at 34 15 level and strongly sold at 34 17
6289057 thanks to everyday americans who chose to make a difference millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries
6289058 we want to remind them that the public is out there eager for them to say more about this
6289059 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6289060 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with

6289062 computer programs for disabling the history and file caching features of a web browser and computer software for notifying a user of a web browser when others are tracking web use and for controlling the information others can access about such use
6289063 users may wish to begin a private browsing session to research a medical condition or plan a surprise vacation or birthday party for a loved one
6289064 the larger challenge here is notifying users clearly about what sites theyre disclosing information to and enabling them to control that disclosure if they choose

6289067 we are now keen to hear from new zealanders any views they have before we make our decision on tuesday

6289071 i might have to talk to tufts about the uniform after putting it on
6289072 i like the old school look right now we have the t with the tusks around it but a couple of years ago they had the elephant head i dont think theyve ever had anything quite like this i love it
6289073 the first couple of weeks there it was tough to run the bases
6289074 the ball travels more out there which is nice for a hitter it was a good year out there
6289075 its a great idea a great cause a chance to meet new guys and a chance to go out and have fun for a night
6289076 i think its a very good cause its a nice ballpark
6289077 for me personally this is a highlight of the summer
6289078 as a teacher with summers off i love being around young guys and trying to be involved in baseball and definitely for a good cause my kids are here for the practices and the games and its just enjoyable its great to see good young ballplayers out working hard and raising money for something i think is important
6289079 playing in the big leagues we always had those days where it was an old timers uniform night so to be able to put one on again is always special this one is a little heavy so hopefully it wont be too hot
6289080 hey now quittinglamejob get the bagels with the cheese built in they got the cheese and the bagel all at once no need for any of that slicing dicing grating the cheese
6289081 hey now maybe you left that bagel in too long
6289082 well lets just leave it in there quittinglamejob and wait patiently like we always do nevermind those sizzles
6289083 when you lose big games like that youre angry at yourself because when you wear the u s jersey a lot is expected youre supposed to win gold medals to miss out on even an opportunity to do that was very disappointing
6289084 its what fuels us i know not all of this team was there but everybody else watched it on tv weve already watched film on that game and i think were a much better team now sometimes losses turn out to be the biggest wins because you can learn more and they can motivate you
6289085 you can see that people are all about winning its never been about the stat sheet or whos got what
6289086 and i told them in our very first meeting that after winning three gold medals i cant remember who led what in any statistics but you dont forget the losses
6289087 some people in some countries are happy with bronze medals we werent and we arent
6289088 mark is a very skilled linebacker and its to his attributes that were able to do that with him were fortunate that we have someone who can do that we have to try and fit in with everybody and thats where his best position for us is right now
6289089 its not even so much about looking to the next level yet
6289090 its just that i started out my freshman year at middle and you get to be the play caller and the leader of the defense sophomore year i moved over to the weak side and theres not many pass routes to your side and its more run game
6289091 now im on the field side and you still have to help out with the run and set the edge but you really have to be sharp on your drops and pass coverage it adds to my game in spots where ive been weak in the past
6289092 the mental scheme isnt as tough as some of the other linebacker positions but physically youve got to match up against some of the best wide receivers in the country and you have to be sharp with that every time
6289093 once we lost abby pretty much all expectations were off us
6289094 an opportunity kind of arose for me and ive been playing a lot more than originally planned
6289095 ive been really calm ive gone into this with no nerves and a lot of confidence
6289096 its not their first rodeo theyve been here a bunch were just going to keep grinding it out we can always find ways to win
6289097 our fearless leader our captain our general twelve guys 12 different characters 12 different emotions hugh has a pretty good beat on all of them
6289098 but when im here and im in the gym with the guys were doing fine were ok
6289099 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6289100 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6289101 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6289102 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6289103 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6289104 in order to ensure that any investigation of the allegations is fair and free from any question of interference or influence i am taking a leave of absence effective immediately for the duration of the investigation
6289105 i believe these steps will allow our union to continue to serve the best interests of our membership during this time
6289106 in the four years that jeb bradley was there did you ever hear him talk about a brown snake program
6289107 his pledge was convenient today but a little bit different several years ago when he was a bureaucrat
6289108 youre more concerned commissioner with the political process than with saving the lives of the men and women who serve this country
6289109 youve waited too long you failed us when you had the chance
6289110 it real id is not a national id that would be a passport its a minimum standard for state drivers licenses
6289111 i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind
6289112 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6289113 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6289114 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
6289115 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6289116 a lot of people said mark and i wouldnt work out then but we proved them wrong and im looking forward to working side by side with him in the enduros again
6289117 we were on pole in both races and while the results may have gone pear shaped for other reasons everything else went smoothly we had no issues and the working relationship was fine
6289118 garth and mark present one of the strongest driver combinations in the field and allow us to put our best foot forward
6289119 this is the best possible strategy for us to look after garths championship while still chasing race wins
6289120 both guys know what it takes to win enduro races and look after the car so im confident that if we get a straight run at it we can look after both of those objectives
6289121 hes got a bit of a strain in his thigh
6289122 its a soft tissue one so if you do try and play and mask it with a jab or anti inflammatory injections you can do more damage so certainly weve got to look after david
6289123 its just a precaution and we want to make sure hes going to be fit for next week and by playing he might do more damage to the thigh so its important we look after him
6289124 to be able to come back in 2007 and especially at the world cup and perform at i guess the biggest stage its the pinnacle of our sport and play reasonably well there i came away with a lot of confidence and took that into the super 14
6289125 but at the same time it means nothing if you dont continue on with it so it is just seeking that consistency which i guess has eluded me somewhat in the early stages of my career
6289126 with these new elvs it certainly creates a lot more opportunity at full back in terms of counter attack and turn over ball and getting your hands on the ball as much as you can
6289127 certainly late in the halves when the bigger guys are getting fatigued there is some scope there to try to get involved and get a few mismatches
6289128 you wouldnt believe what these fans do when following around their favorite bands theyre the most insane fans of all time they tattoo their bands logo on this body part and that body part
6289129 our ethnographic research has shown us that students responded well to tablet and touch screen technology
6289130 the creativity interactivity and user friendliness of the new design will enhance the learning experiences for these children this is important for both emerging and mature markets where technology is increasing being seen as a key tool in encouraging learning and facilitating teaching
6289131 old enough to know better young enough not to stop
6289132 home brewers have found the internet to be a useful tool to achieve their goals
6289133 no the michael phelps will see mark spitzs pornstache n bet award winning bling look and raise him a little splash of total nudity
6289134 the main design goal of a spoiler in passenger vehicles is to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency
6289135 a spoiler may also function as a bookshelf in town or an auto parts storage unit on the highway
6289136 we were very lucky this guy was stopped and nobody was killed yesterday
6289137 we are lucky that the quick response from officers and help from the citizens saved us from a very serious incident
6289138 we need to be able to have it in more than one theatre at a time
6289139 our sailors must be able to transport and support canadian troops operating overseas sometimes perhaps on a hostile shore
6289140 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
6289141 in costs in costs were making it work more efficiently but theres no reduction in capacity
6289142 it is likely that there will be a similar shift in demand again this year
6289143 it will clearly impact on the delivery of intensive care services in this hospital
6289144 if you have a post surgical catastrophe here and there are no icu beds that patient will have to transferred out to another hospital
6289145 severe impact on how we operate and patients would have to be treated elsewhere
6289146 there is no plan for stage 3 to go ahead at this point in time there is no timeframe set for that and that stage involves a big upheaval
6289147 as the demand for services at particular hospitals goes up and down the spending for those services will change
6289148 the use of the icu at the lyell mcewin hospital rose dramatically as demand has grown in the north
6289149 we want to provide more services closer to people live
6289150 this is the most difficult trying time of the season
6289151 and this is the most difficult trying season i can ever remember
6289152 we are not pitching well right now to say the least
6289153 there are things i think can be done but nothing that i would want to put in the newspaper
6289154 the last two series the twins and the white sox hit everything we threw at them
6289155 but i didnt see a whole lot of adjustments being made by our pitchers when they are hitting you like that you have to make adjustments
6289156 i begged them to let me stay in the game
6289157 if im going to give up runs i might as well stay in the game the bullpen is having to eat a lot of innings lately
6289158 i feel bad for the fans the players the players wives who have to see their husbands struggle
6289159 but this is a time that tests character character is made in times like this and weve got to show what weve got
6289160 when you are going good things are easy now when things are tough is when you have to get it done
6289161 we are still awaiting the results of forensic testing of blood found on the accuseds hands
6289162 that application will have to be heard in the supreme court so the sooner we get it up there the sooner this can be resolved
6289163 please exit the elevator and check out the shop to your right
6289164 hey heres a star wars ride there isnt a line lets go
6289165 das wrack war total verkohlt und voller leichen da sah nichts mehr wie ein flugzeug aus
6289166 there is probably a little danger of that except that team has beaten us to the point this year that i think our guys are feeling like you know what we have a tough game every day
6289167 oakland and texas are not up there with the angels in the standings but they are far ahead of us and have beaten us
6289168 we have guys fighting for their careers or to establish themselves in the big leagues so it would be totally unacceptable if that happens if it did those players would have to be weeded out of the herd
6289169 greenies arm was a little tender about the break so in addition to the break i thought id give him some extra time
6289170 it turns out i overdid it with the time off
6289171 it was a case where he said he was ready but then a game came up where i really didnt need him so i thought id give him an extra day
6289172 i think there were too many days and i take full responsibility for it hes been rusty ever since and i think youre still seeing that now
6289173 i did it in good conscience but its wound up impacting the whole bullpen
6289174 i think its just that parts of the season are going to be up and down
6289175 i feel fine the reason for the walks is that im off a little mechanically and things just dont always go your way 100 percent of the time
6289176 youd rather have a hit like that than a twist or a sprain
6289177 when youre hit like that you know the pain will go away eventually
6289178 hes a work in progress and im sure hes feeling the difference between going three or four innings instead of one or 1 1
6289179 hes doing ok though he went up to 60 pitches in his last start and will be in the 70s when he starts thursday for tacoma
6289180 id look at it as gravy if he does pitch again in 2008
6289181 id love for him to pitch id like to have him feel good about how hes pitching going into the offseason
6289182 we know the wrong kind of music and drugs have bad effects young people need to be informed of the effects of bad satanic music
6289183 obviously im disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died as far as my responsibility for that goes it stops there because i know our message is actually very positive
6289184 it has moved into a system integrated urban design problem
6289185 computing is usually defined like the activity of using and developing software
6289186 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6289187 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day
6289188 american is excited to offer our customers more of brazil
6289189 it is a dynamic country in so many ways and americans comprehensive schedule of service to its leading business leisure and cultural centers puts it all conveniently and easily within reach
6289190 about the set lists its a process of trial amp error mostly error we actually had some time to rehearse a couple of songs were never played live before and were gonna do these now on this tour most of the songs will however be a nice mixture of old and new favorites some to which you can dance and some to which you cant we tried hard to bring this tour to hawaii but not hard enough i think i sent a request to have all off days in either hawaii or las vegas but neither seems to be possible this time so wed probably end up staying on the bus in front of a wal mart somewhere speaking of wal mart our shopping lists include socks chivas regal 12 years old frank zappa cds cowboy boots marlboro lights ice more chivas and new zippo lighters i sincerely believe our finnish super livers will survive many more tours than this one so no liver transplants will be necessary conan obrien should still fear having us show up in his studio audience because we will prevail eventually were bound to succeed according to the great prophecies of reverend lance what would be greater than appearing on his first show when he replaces jay leno well keep the rest of the plan a secret
6289191 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6289192 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6289193 cada quil metro que passava eu estava desenvolvendo melhor meu nado

6289196 thats not to say that a small butcher cant make mistakes but at best hes going to kill off a few of his neighbours when you take that same mistake and you put it into a plant that serves millions the risk is vastly expanded
6289197 shift from full time cfia meat inspection presence to an oversight role allowing industry to implement food safety control programs and to manage key risks
6289198 the announcement of these reallocations has been deferred owing to significant communications risks and to allow for further policy and communications work to be completed
6289199 the perception in how its being presented at this time is that we are walking away we will not have presence or we wont be carrying out inspections and that in fact is not the case
6289200 what we talking about is recognizing there is a very clear responsibility on the part of industry government can never regulate or inspect its way to total food safety
6289201 but for heavens sake we ought to make the system better not increase the risk
6289202 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6289203 before that meeting were going to get quite a few statements from opec officials expressing opinions in the end i dont expect a production cut but they may push for greater adherence to output quotas

6289213 the summons dies with the dissolution of parliament for an election
6289214 thats the only thing that can stop us because we are bound and determined to drag all these senior conservatives before the committee and its going to be embarrassing
6289215 it certainly contradicts the spirit of the fixed election date laws to manipulate the election date to avoid embarrassment maybe they figured better to take one or two days of bad headlines than risk genuinely damaging testimony and if theyre going to pack up parliament anyway then theyre scot free
6289216 i was thinking that i could just drive over to your office right now and you could tell me what you think of my hair can i stick with this new hair gel or should i go buy the old stuff
6289217 you want to come to my office so i can look at your hair
6289218 the best blogs have a tinge of obsession about them

6289221 if we stay here past midnight i am worried everyone will turn into vampires
6289222 i have a boat and its a full moon tonight its going to be quite a sight to see around midnight we could save the wine until then
6289223 you know you want to just come on its a beautiful summer night and opportunities like this a boat the moon and the sky do not come along every day
6289224 if we stay here past midnight i am worried everyone will turn into vampires

6289229 theyre extremely helpful in reducing the amount of routine calls that the parks law enforcement park rangers have to manage freeing up rangers time for more complex duties
6289230 they want to know if it has enough pickup if it can cope with the roads
6289231 we go home to oak ridge on sundays for church
6289232 callers did not think they were bound by the do not call list and now they are
6289233 we are just exploring the possibilities it is not our intent to try and replace the current management
6289234 its not a conducive situation because the two are really segregated
6289235 its been the same thing forever we would like to see something different
6289236 we as a board want what best benefits the theater
6289237 our vision is to blend the experience of attending the bijou theatre with an unparalleled cafe dining experience and create a unique and dynamic destination in downtown knoxville
6289238 there were so many threats on dads life we had a trooper behind every tree
6289239 was the only southern governor that really upheld brown v board of education at that time
6289240 one of the most beautiful sights i saw in south clinton was seeing the state troopers coming in
6289241 he frank clement took an oath of office to uphold the law of the land
6289242 sen finney notified the state party wednesday that he would not be pursuing a recount
6289243 the tennessee republican party thanks sen finney for his years of service to his community and the state and we look forward to working with doug overbey upon his election to the state senate from the 8th district this november

6289252 i think its taking a tremendous amount of taxpayer resources and ive seen no evidence of fraud
6289253 i think he would do for sen obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that sen obama has right now
6289254 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6289255 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6289256 i made it clear to him and everybody else i never worked for anybody in my life
6289257 i got here when i was 29 i never had a boss i dont know how id handle it
6289258 the school did not merely find that confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in the context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6289259 the racist graffiti was violent in character the graffiti contained examples of the most demeaning racial slurs accompanied by threats against the lives of african americans generally an image of a noose next to that of a confederate flag and hit lists containing specific students names
6289260 that graffiti exemplifies how school officials reasonably concluded that the connection between the symbolism of the confederate flag and racial tensions at the school meant that the confederate flag would likely have a disruptive effect on the school
6289261 we caution however that our decision today does not establish a precedent justifying a schools ban on student speech merely because other students find that speech offensive
6289262 we simply hold that the william blount high schools dress code as applied to ban the confederate flag is constitutional because of the disruptive potential of the flag in a school where racial tension is high and serious racially motivated incidents such as physical altercations or threats of violence have occurred
6289263 creo que todo es una broma porque nunca recib un mail de kenita
6289264 if the entire town is guilty because of one drunken fight doesnt that make all illegal immigrants guilty since some of them commit crimes do you see ms 13 holding vigils for the people theyve murdered someone should kick those jew reporters in the throat
6289265 nationwide students who drop out of school will be underemployed i have read that dropouts earn almost 10 000 less a year than high school graduates plus 80 percent of those involved in the criminal justice system are dropouts
6289266 weve already begun to strengthen the guidance department at the high school
6289267 weve just finished a pretty intensive summer school so i think were making progress on our strategies its simply a matter of staying focused and keeping kids motivated and keeping them with us in school
6289268 from what she has told me yes its a coyote problem
6289269 its horrible its astounding to see what an animal can do to another
6289270 a dog will kill a cat but a coyote will eat a cat for food
6289271 a cat or a small dog is like filet mignon for a coyote a fox is not likely to kill or eat a cat if the cat has been consumed the coyote even if they havent been seen is the no 1 suspect
6289272 ive seen coyotes in the neighborhood in the last couple of years and ive seen them running around recently
6289273 i know they coyotes can wipe out pets in a neighborhood
6289274 one of the ladies i knew came out on her patio and found one of her pekingese half eaten then she saw a coyote carry off her other pekingese in its mouth she tried to stop it by throwing things at it but it didnt do any good
6289275 my cats like to go out at night i have a large backyard and i dont want to be afraid to let them out im really worried about this
6289276 coyotes are something we used to never hear about around here
6289277 theyre in every county in tennessee now theyre becoming more and more common and nothing is going to stop them theyre expanding all over the eastern u s
6289278 the coyote is the top predator around he has extremely strong jaws and teeth man is his only enemy
6289279 theyre about the height of a german shepherd but not as bulky or thick they will attack dogs of any size two labs were attacked by them in knoxville last year
6289280 every month we wait is a month where a developer comes to us cutting down trees is something that is irreversible
6289281 whatever we come up with will give us something to hang our hat on
6289282 now its more like gee wed like you to keep some trees an ordinance clarifies codifies it and everybody knows up front what youre dealing with
6289283 with the way our culture is set up were so far removed from the environment
6289284 para los grupos que se ven en la patagonia es uno relativamente grande

6289287 this is the biggest civil war re enactment in the west this year
6289288 i think people will be impressed and surprised by the quality of the event and the number of things to do it will take two days for people to see it all
6289289 agt reported to the defense department that no foreign nationals would work on the phase ii munitions contract project
6289290 during the entire time period of the contract agt and its employees were aware and knew that xin dai was a peoples republic of china national that he was working on the phase ii munitions contract and that he had been exposed to and provided technical data associated with this project
6289291 i dont know i guess this was the match youve all been waiting for
6289292 i think i had more emotion about playing against the united states when i played them back in shanghai thankfully i got the emotion out then medal or no medal its been a hell of a run and ive given you guys something to talk about for the whole summer
6289293 beckys a friend of mine but all we see is that jersey with russia on it
6289294 were at war at this point we know shes going to be there and its just like the rest of them shes an enemy
6289295 to think of her willingly putting on a jersey for russia is unfathomable to me
6289296 youd have to tie me down and force it over my head and i still would be fighting it off im an american period
6289297 thanks to everyday americans who chose to make a difference millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries
6289298 we want to remind them that the public is out there eager for them to say more about this
6289299 en la noche tienen que ir a recibir un equipo a santa fe asi que pues ahi los acompanas

6289301 golongan ini mempunyai kesedaran mengenai masalah seksual mereka dan lebih terbuka untuk berbincang dan menerima rawatan yang diperlukan untuk memastikan hubungan kelaminnya kekal dan mampu memberikan kepuasan kepada pasangannya

6289303 kebanyakan lelaki malaysia masih menganggap bahawa masalah ereksi sebagai subjek taboo

6289305 these are good results for us the popps and everybody involved
6289306 the visual analysis bruce wuethrich ordered was limited in scope
6289307 i dont have an s on my chest and she doesnt fly an invisible jet
6289308 back then we had several women who instead of a diamond engagement would get a tennessee pearl
6289309 during the worlds fair we made jewelry for people who sold it it was very popular
6289310 and said i want to make ring out of this a pendant out of that they would go crazy over them
6289311 we make a wax mold and cast the mounting thats the only you can do it because no pearl is just alike
6289312 they are more teardrop shaped when they become a certain size some people call them spikes
6289313 you get to see how it happens people are fascinated with the process
6289314 i think the appeal is that its something that comes from tennessee its native its kind of like the ut vols its very special
6289315 i am more bullish than bearish i think the market has too quickly discounted geopolitical risks and was too concerned with demand destruction we should be trending back towards 120 125 a barrel
6289316 we see the big picture of demand destruction in the u s but there is also a lot of bullish news that is driving the market
6289317 if you arent doing anything wrong what do you have to hide
6289318 if im not doing anything wrong then you have no cause to watch me
6289319 because the government gets to define whats wrong and they keep changing the definition
6289320 if one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man i would find something in them to have him hanged
6289321 dont need a federal law to ask them to slow down
6289322 one hundred percent of this increase will go to tva
6289323 weve only increased our own rates once in the last 17 years
6289324 we are urging them to pay extra each month to cover the raise
6289325 i dont think this is going to get any better for several quarters
6289326 most of our lower income households pay a higher percentage of their income toward home heating and cooling
6289327 where you and i may spend 2 to 3 percent of our total income they may spend upwards of 14 or 15 percent so almost any increase has an impact on their resources
6289328 a lot of the families some of them are laid off they have fewer hours of work and just the rise in food costs the rise in the transportation costs the water and wastewater charges its almost like a perfect storm
6289329 its just hitting the pocketbook at all kinds of levels
6289330 you have to try to figure out what fuel is most efficient that you can use at any given time
6289331 really theres not much you can do about electrical rates we can just control our consumption
6289332 we as an internationally headquartered company have to give our top management some view of the future operational costs and profitability at this location but tva has not put forth a plan that gives a road map for the future or that gives us any hope that the situation will ever change
6289333 we certainly will look for other areas where we might offset the increase in cost in utilities
6289334 any kind of power increase in tennessee would impact competitiveness which is something you do not want to do to a leading economic contributor
6289335 for some time we have encouraged employees to turn out lights when they leave and unplug computers
6289336 we are also trying to do more of the heaviest work with equipment during morning hours
6289337 the burden on us is how do we come up with the additional money
6289338 its not a surprise but it doesnt make it any easier to swallow
6289339 we thank the public for all their support and information
6289340 we are sick of the dunedin community and students being seen to be part of this
6289341 these groups need to understand that drunken parties which predictably lead to street violence and property damage is not acceptable its just bloody stupid
6289342 it is purely poorly organised public disorder and anyone guilty in such illegal activities should be punished to the full extent
6289343 how would christchurch students feel if we went up to their city burned cars couches and caused violence on their city streets
6289344 we would rightly never be allowed back yet somehow they believe its alright to do in dunedin

6289368 as oil nestles in here at well over a cost of 100 a barrel we are continuing to feed the ambitions and the determination of the chavezes the putins and the ahmadinejads of the world to exert themselves more forcefully

6289379 ladies and gentlemen i believe that this new doctrine preached by mr lincoln and his party will dissolve the union if it succeeds
6289380 i believe this government cannot endure half slave and half free it must become all one thing or all the other
6289381 the difference between the republican and the democratic parties is that the former consider slavery a moral social and political wrong while the latter do not consider it either a moral social or political wrong
6289382 i am not in favor of negro citizenship i agree with judge douglas he is not my equal in many respects certainly not in color perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment
6289383 no recorded debate in the english language surpassed those between lincoln and douglas for keen give and take vigorous saxon language and clear exposition of the vital issue

6289440 in recent years western australian has consistently been one of the worst states in australia in terms of road deaths per head of population this is a sorry situation when the express aim of the governments previous strategy was to make wa the safest state
6289441 the rac is calling for an election commitment from both the labor and liberal parties that they will fully implement and fully fund the road safety strategy
6289442 if properly adopted this new strategy could save more than 1 000 people from being killed or seriously injured on our roads in the next four years
6289443 western australia needs a strategic approach to road safety and towards zero is a good plan combining the main elements of road improvements driver education and enforcement and safer vehicles

6289450 i can absolutely understand the frustration that so many farmers feel when the water that they know would produce a profitable crop simply isnt available on zero allocations
6289451 von dem olympiasieg ber 200 meter habe ich getr umt seit ich ein kleines kind bin

6289464 i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6289465 look hes going to do it hes going to break the 200m world record theres no doubt about it
6289466 its very possible for him to break the record its just not going to happen this year
6289467 i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible
6289468 guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride

6289470 honest services wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering
6289471 the object of the scheme and artifice to defraud and deprive was to secretly obtain approximately 250 000 paid by collaborator 18 for the benefit of the defendant acevedo vil and comit an bal and to use the authority and influence of the office of the governor to benefit collaborator 18 and his companies it was further object of the scheme to conceal defendant acevedo vil s financial relationship with collaborator 18 and his corporations from the people of puerto rico
6289472 after being sworn in as governor in 2005 defendant acevedo vil provided direct and personal assistance to collaborator 18s business interests by meeting directly with collaborator 18 to discuss collaborator 18s business concerns and proposals as they related to the puerto rico government and then directing defendant incl n bird as well as other aides and subordinates to provide official assistance to collaborator 18 in his dealings with the government of puerto rico
6289473 defendant acevedo vil would at times while directing such assistance inform some aides that collaborator 18 had helped his campaign
6289474 this new indictment comes a month and a half after we moved to dismiss the original indictment based on it numerous legal defects that is no coincidence
6289475 a short while ago i was informed by the department of justice that the grand jury has returned yet another indictment against governor acevedo vil and two other defendants charged in the original indictment it also comes just eleven weeks before the citizens of puerto rico are scheduled to go to the polls to vote for their governor that is no coincidence either i am dismayed that the united states department of justice which has previously vowed to purge itself of political motivations and influences is still determined to engage in these kinds of heavy handed unfair tactics in puerto rico governor acevedo vil firmly denies these charges we shall attack this indictment as aggressively as we attacked the first indictment and we shall do everything in our power to see to it that the bush justice department does not impact the outcome of the pending election
6289476 i have never committed an illegal act and i have never asked anyone to do so there is not one allegation of illegally awarding contracts bribery or embezzlement of public funds

6289480 detectives are unclear as to why she made up the story
6289481 we have forwarded the case to the snohomish county prosecutors office for review to see if they want to file a false reporting charge against her

6289483 huruma is a tough place last january during the elections there was rioting and six people were hacked to death
6289484 i have seen two of my friends killed i have scars from defending myself with my fists i am good with my fists
6289485 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6289486 abide by that basic precept in the book of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
6289487 i would love to see even more athletes involved in speaking out about not only what i believe in but what they believe in as well
6289488 i think that the games have run with amazing efficiency i believe that the chinese people are warm and have been generally wonderful hosts to the games
6289489 the reason i do the work i do on darfur is because of my experience as an olympian i and any other athlete or person of course but this is an olympics story who chooses to speak out about issues of conscience when people are losing their lives has every right to do so
6289490 were coming into a new era an era of consciousness among business leaders with the power to make a real difference and while many hr departments are racing to install environmental managers to their executive team those executive teams are still getting the most direct help from specialists
6289491 building social content has become critical in creating buzz among next gen news seekers
6289492 traditional outreach is jurassic to be successful at our jobs we need to make it easier for people to authentically discover new brands and companies on their own
6289493 consumers everywhere are increasingly aware of the impacts purchasing decisions exert on the environment and their family discerning shoppers particularly parents are more likely to establish brand loyalty with those who consistently have consumers best interests in mind
6289494 there is anecdotal evidence that kids get inspired when they see their olympic heroes do well
6289495 often many gold medalists will say they were inspired by seeing former sporting heroes do well i guess that is the impact the government would hope to get out of this
6289496 all the inspiration doesnt make up for a lack of facilities
6289497 there is a complete dearth of facilities here compared with somewhere like australia
6289498 i think the lack of facilities here just leads to kids hanging about on the streets with nowhere to go
6289499 in terms of olympic medals the thing that probably gets you furthest is spending and focusing resources on athletes who have come forward who are doing well
6289500 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6289501 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6289502 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6289503 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6289504 she said the beijing games rather than bequeathing a positive legacy
6289505 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6289506 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6289507 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6289508 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure
6289509 he said human rights should be a higher priority as cities compete to host the games and urged the ioc to develop a
6289510 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
6289511 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
6289512 at the daily olympic press briefing journalists have been given short blunt responses to questions about the outlawed spiritual group falun gong and the free tibet movement whose supporters have staged several protests during the games
6289513 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6289514 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further
6289515 but ironically the olympic games exposed more social crises than ever like the tibet issue to the chinese people
6289516 she also suggested the olympic press corps has underreported the impact of the surveillance and security infrastructure installed for the games including collection of data on the many foreign visitors
6289517 in the end they pretty much defined the terms in which the media was going to operate
6289518 those terms are not the same as in the western world
6289519 the authors of kidnappings are not the same as those of restavek
6289520 the government of jamaica will request that the issue be brought for discussion at the highest level of caricom
6289521 several good reasons to believe that the country was once again about to change direction
6289522 l gico que a gente vai ficar juntas pelo menos eu penso que sim
6289523 o time n o tem porque pensar nisso temos que pensar em como vamos trabalhar nos pr ximos quatro anos como vamos nos preparar
6289524 n o tenho muita curiosidade al m disso n o ainda mais depois de agora
6289525 yeah brandy used to watch his eyes when he told his sailor stories
6289526 even in the face of that ordeal to be able to express his thanks said a lot about who he is
6289527 for this year 2008 its been pretty all consuming up to this point
6289528 he put it aptly i think as being caught up between two fires
6289529 what was actually the difference between torture and coercion is unclear
6289530 they recognized that hamdan was not ideologically connected to terrorism
6289531 we need to provide our criminal defendants with all the rights and protections that the law affords
6289532 its our tradition and it says as much as anything about who we are the way we carry out these trials
6289533 although the absolute risk of esrd in women who have had preeclampsia is low preeclampsia is a marker for an increased risk of subsequent esrd
6289534 the association was stronger if the preeclamptic pregnancy resulted in a low birth weight or preterm infant
6289535 indeed the likelihood that chronic renal failure did not develop even among women with three previous episodes of preeclampsia was greater than 99 percent
6289536 she was one of most passionate and dynamic members of congress with a strong personality
6289537 some people are larger than life and she was one of them its so hard to believe that shes gone
6289538 she was a dedicated legislator tireless advocate for justice and a constant fighter for the people of cleveland and the rest of ohio her wit smile and drive will be greatly missed my constituents and i join her family friends and all of ohio in grieving her passing and celebrating her life
6289539 stephanie was a wow right from the start everybody liked her
6289540 we had such a great rapport we kept in touch over the years and would talk when we went to state and national conventions she was always interested in the young people she was always so gracious with such a sense of humor and such a joy of living and she invited everybody to share that with her
6289541 the last time i saw her was at the naacp banquet here at new philadelphia
6289542 we had a really nice visit and she wrote such glowing remarks on my program i will certainly miss her as i know everyone will who came into contact with her
6289543 she was just a bundle of energy and very motivating her speech that night was very inspiring she urged people to get involved in the democratic process and their community to get off the sidelines and not to sit back complaining
6289544 who was positive and could shed some light on the naacp and encourage people to get involved because we were reorganizing our local chapter i would say she far exceeded any expectations we had of her
6289545 i feel like our world has been shaken especially in the black community because congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones was a voice in northeast ohio that resonated all the way across our nation
6289546 she is irreplaceable she was very engaging and charismatic and she articulated the needs and concerns of the minority community in a way that brought about respect and improved the cause of equal justice and fairness in government
6289547 as speaker for our king day event she spoke with purpose showing us that although we are a small community in the eyes of god we share equality with communities everywhere regardless of size her encouragement was uplifting and very empowering i feel like she was one of the more influential speakers who has addressed our community were truly saddened that weve lost a giant among people

6289550 she apparently jumped into a trash compactor after she had fled from the security guards at t j maxx
6289551 they had an employee go out to cycle the compactor
6289552 i dont know if they heard a scream or not
6289553 a new castle man thought a garbage can on cunningham avenue would be a good place to hide his money but that didnt turn out to be the case the man whose name has not been released allegedly stuffed 30 000 inside the can but when he went to retrieve it later it was gone police arent saying why the man hid they money in the trash can the man is offering a 1 000 reward for anyone who returns the money anyone with information is asked to contact the new castle police department
6289554 a judge has acquitted a man of creating a risk of bodily harm by shooting a woman in the crotch after asking her to perform oral sex

6289557 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6289558 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6289559 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6289560 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6289561 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6289562 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6289563 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6289564 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6289565 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6289566 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6289567 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6289568 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6289569 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6289570 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6289571 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6289572 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6289573 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6289574 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6289575 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6289576 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6289577 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6289578 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6289579 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6289580 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6289581 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
6289582 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
6289583 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
6289584 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
6289585 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
6289586 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6289587 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6289588 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6289589 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6289590 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6289591 they told me there are going to be resources here
6289592 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6289593 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6289594 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6289595 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6289596 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6289597 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6289598 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6289599 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6289600 the survivors explained to us that passengers were squeezed together on the bus
6289601 we have no doubt over 50 people died in this catastrophe
6289602 we will never be able to find all those people
6289603 before the water gets to where we could reach them it passes through a place called trou canari where bodies could be stuck
6289604 those who know the area know about trou canari if you fall there there is no way to go and get you you are simply lost forever
6289605 nobody will want to go to those places to search for bodies
6289606 some were trying to call for help but we could not do anything for them those who were saved had a chance to get out through an open back door that was not under water and got on top of the bus
6289607 the caribbean community caricom congratulates the phenomenal usain bolt of jamaica on his astonishing victories in the sprint events of the olympic games the 100 and 200 metres
6289608 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
6289609 as you stated room 20 will now be used for something else
6289610 the matters that led to us having to get this report
6289611 t heir intent was to reduce the impact of the students behavior on other students and at the same time prevent other students from watching him when he was having a difficult time
6289612 you dont expect because of fire safety regulations to see locks on doors
6289613 attacking staff and trying to punch through a glass door
6289614 we are not acknowledging that a physical restraint occurred as defined by the regulations
6289615 the only thing were waiting for is documents to confirm what we heard out there
6289616 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6289617 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6289618 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6289619 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6289620 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6289621 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6289622 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6289623 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6289624 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6289625 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6289626 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6289627 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6289628 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6289629 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6289630 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6289631 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6289632 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6289633 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6289634 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6289635 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6289636 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6289637 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6289638 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6289639 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6289640 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6289641 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6289642 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6289643 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6289644 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6289645 there was an opening at melbourne crown towers in australia so i took it
6289646 i joined an advertising company in shanghai just when the city was on the cusp of its period of incredible expansion
6289647 try to avoid overtime because you will arrive at work stressed and fatigued the next day
6289648 visitors are looking for something unique something extraordinary which typical large scale luxury hotels do not offer because of standardisation policies here the luxe manor has the edge because its smaller scale allows staff to make inimitable touches which truly strike home with guests
6289649 be sincere committed and focused and then everything is possible
6289650 try to avoid overtime because you will arrive at work stressed and fatigued the next day
6289651 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6289652 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6289653 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6289654 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6289655 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6289656 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6289657 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6289658 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
6289659 you have miles to go between areas and youll receive missions and the missions are very story focused
6289660 its not just a bunch of random things that you can do a sandbox game its very focused so you use your different vehicles to get places you need to accomplish goals and tasks through the racing part of it with the vehicles we want to make them extensions of your first person avatar when you have a vehicle you have it for the whole game you can do upgrades to it you can customize it we wanted to go for more of the arcadey fun feel of the vehicle combat and vehicle driving its not a vehicle simulator its focused on fun and action
6289661 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6289662 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6289663 ich freue mich tierisch es war nat rlich recht knapp bis zum ersten und zweiten aber ich bin bergl cklich
6289664 ich denke bei olympia kann man nur von gewonnenen medaillen sprechen
6289665 ich habe es immer wieder ausgeleert jetzt brennt es ein bisschen
6289666 ich habe mich 700 meter vor dem ziel ein bisschen behakt das hat vielleicht zu viel kraft gekostet
6289667 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
6289668 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6289669 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6289670 no problem im very calm ill win the gold medal
6289671 i kind of got out of control but i was able to pick it up on the last few hurdles
6289672 im very sorry i didnt make the final at home
6289673 usain bolt is a super human being the world has never seen anything like him
6289674 not only is he physically the best in the world but he has supreme confidence in himself and he knows how to deliver
6289675 jamaican athletes are the best jamaica is the sprint factory of the world
6289676 i want to appeal to jamaica to stop the crime i want to specially appeal to the maxfield community to put down the guns
6289677 my daughter has done all of us from the ghetto proud and we should stop the fighting
6289678 i am in shock i dont know what to say this is just unbelievable
6289679 this is a great moment in our nations history this has never happened before
6289680 there is a big motorcade in the town square of falmouth that has been going on for more than two hours
6289681 some people have placed desks in the road and placed a vast amount of liquor on them for everyone to drink and be merry it is just like a carnival down here
6289682 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6289683 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6289684 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6289685 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6289686 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6289687 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6289688 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6289689 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6289690 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6289691 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6289692 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6289693 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6289694 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6289695 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6289696 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6289697 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6289698 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6289699 he dont like liberals and he dont pull no punches
6289700 great name lively commentary great name good satire great name
6289701 a damn good lesson in how to combine incisive commentary with well chosen links
6289702 a must read for digging into hard questions on policy and values of the right and left
6289703 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6289704 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6289705 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6289706 there were no parameters and you did what the hell you wanted up to legal and military limits
6289707 the more creative you were the more they liked it
6289708 youre supposed to be a spy not a bond salesman
6289709 he dont like liberals and he dont pull no punches
6289710 great name lively commentary great name good satire great name
6289711 a damn good lesson in how to combine incisive commentary with well chosen links
6289712 a must read for digging into hard questions on policy and values of the right and left
6289713 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6289714 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6289715 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6289716 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6289717 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6289718 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6289719 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6289720 es war so beeindruckend ich kann das heute gar nicht mit worten beschreiben
6289721 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6289722 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6289723 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6289724 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6289725 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6289726 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6289727 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6289728 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6289729 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6289730 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6289731 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6289732 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6289733 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6289734 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6289735 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6289736 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6289737 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6289738 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6289739 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6289740 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6289741 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6289742 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6289743 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6289744 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6289745 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6289746 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6289747 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6289748 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6289749 its incredible it leaves you speechless but yes i did think he would break my record
6289750 he needs to set himself some other goals he could be world record holder in 100 200 and 400
6289751 he finished up in an incredible time this was an incredible performance he wanted that record
6289752 he got an incredible start i looked at his start and just went wow it was more amazing than the 100 metres guys that tall should not be able to start like that
6289753 he wanted that record this is his favourite event he went for it he came in focused on it knowing he would most likely win the gold
6289754 my concern was he would not have the ability to hold that speed for the entire race but he showed he has been working on that he used every ounce of energy he wanted that record
6289755 the team has been together for five years weve accomplished a lot but theres still a long way to go
6289756 there are great athletes in china what do they have at the moment 40 golds it takes time the girls gymnastics team took 50 years to get gold
6289757 we need to develop the programme in china we need to develop young players so that they will ready for the next olympics
6289758 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs
6289759 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6289760 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6289761 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6289762 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6289763 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6289764 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6289765 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6289766 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6289767 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6289768 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6289769 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6289770 we will continue to press for freedom of speech here in the turks and caicos because we are a democratic country
6289771 the commission of enquiry is here and they need to be aware of how this pnp government has prevented our party access to the people through the media the days of the pnp covering up are ending and we are here to see to it
6289772 freedom of speech is one of the basic tenets of a democratic country and when this freedom is suppressed the basic concept of democracy is undermined
6289773 we are not only demonstrating on behalf of the pdm but also on behalf of all the people of our country we believe there must be equal access to the local media from both sides of the political spectrum for our people to truly understand each and every issue and to understand what is happening in our country unless there is freedom of speech our people will never be free
6289774 we feel equal access is important thats what we are demonstrating for
6289775 how can it be that pnp can air their lies on wiv and we are not permitted to tell the truth
6289776 lisaraye her cousin phillip travis and her publicist lynn jeter assaulted the guard at the premiers home and proceeded to ransack the house and then assaulted the premier and his sister
6289777 the premier at no time had any physical contact with lisaraye but as a result of her assault on them both the premier and his sister were taken to the hospital with injuries and later released
6289778 there was no ransacking of the house and no punches were thrown
6289779 i was in the car outside the gate the entire time and never went inside the home
6289780 i could not have assaulted anyone considering i was in lisarayes jeep the entire time
6289781 they were both treated and released with no one staying overnight for any reason
6289782 misick and his entourage went their way and lisaraye went back to her hotel
6289783 biting is not violence hitting ransacking a home and throwing punches are
6289784 lisaraye went the misick home and along with her cousin phillip travis who is her bodyguard entered the home against misicks wishes
6289785 verbal confrontations took place and at some point lisaraye was pinned facing misick with his sister behind the first lady
6289786 someone bit lisaraye on the shoulder and lisaraye bit back in self defence
6289787 biting may be considered violence in a small caribbean country
6289788 i have not seen the alleged photos but the only pictures taken were at the hospital and even we have not seen those
6289789 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6289790 the stringent overall environmental requirements of the olympic games actually served as a catalyst for various measures and the countdown to the games made it even more urgent for the entire society to take action
6289791 the 25 minute ride is not troublesome at all for me its just picking up an old habit again in middle school i used to ride my bicycle every day as most of my classmates did
6289792 these bulbs can help cut my electricity bills in the long run
6289793 on the battleground of climate change we need more green champions i believe these athletes influence will help people translate the green concepts into practice
6289794 there has been a distinct increase in public awareness of environmental protection
6289795 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6289796 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6289797 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6289798 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6289799 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6289800 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6289801 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6289802 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6289803 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6289804 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6289805 they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
6289806 assure s all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself
6289807 it would be a sad day indeed were america to become a quota ridden society with each identifiable minority assigned proportional representation in every desirable walk of life
6289808 like nothing better than to find a race neutral admissions formula
6289809 should probably be treated by any admissions officer as folks who are pretty advantaged
6289810 how could america send men into space and still keep its black citizens in bondage
6289811 what could do more damage to the argument that african americans deserve racial preferences than a majority of americans voting to put an african american in the white house
6289812 if racism in america is so bad then how come
6289813 we have to think about affirmative action and craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
6289814 he dont like liberals and he dont pull no punches
6289815 great name lively commentary great name good satire great name
6289816 a damn good lesson in how to combine incisive commentary with well chosen links
6289817 a must read for digging into hard questions on policy and values of the right and left
6289818 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6289819 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6289820 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6289821 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6289822 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6289823 it was so relevant to what we are doing here

6289842 the 200 metres record has been my dream since i was 15 when i was the youngest ever person to win the world junior title it is my first love
6289843 i have been saying all season to everyone that the 200 metres means a lot more to me than the 100
6289844 a lot of people compare me to michael johnson i dont compare myself to anyone else i am just me he is a great athlete but i am just happy with what i am doing here
6289845 i have no regrets about the 100 metres i just wanted to win the race and i had done the work
6289846 but i knew i could break the 200m record so i left everything out on the track
6289847 i knew i could go that fast i have shown the potential all season but to do that after seven rounds of sprinting is a surprise
6289848 i knew if i was going to get it it would be here because the track is so fast i just gave it everything i had
6289849 i just want to go to bed and let it start to sink in that i am a world record holder

6289857 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6289858 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6289859 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6289860 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

6289873 my dear friend mortimer and i have been trying to figure out a way to get you to stop hunting him so we could explain this all to you luckily for us youre quite a clever cat and figured most of it out on your own once id seen that youd gotten your paws on the shrinking pills i took some too then i donned my mouse costume and made it a point to find you once you were at the downtown party just in case i miscalculated when they might wear off i knew youd need to get out quickly
6289874 i am very pleased to meet you mortimer i hope that from now on we can be friends

6289911 what would an iac shareholder want for interval as part of a broader iac its unanswerable its like solving a rubics cube
6289912 maybe interval doesnt change how it operates maybe ticketmaster uses its currency for acquisitions or maybe one or two of these companies gets bought because theres a better owner for it much more after the jump
6289913 i think whats changed clearly is the discipline and focus with which that capital will be deployed
6289914 when that worked it worked brilliantly well ticketmaster was a phenomenal acquisition it was bought before it sold a single ticket online
