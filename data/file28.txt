280091 the falsity of the operation is inbuilt in the cd the hoarding must have been erected on july 23 or later after the trust vote so what is left there to prove when this particular hoarding appears in the so called operation this is a concoction in which uma bharati has allowed herself to be used by the samajwadi party

280110 we regret that nuclear facilities are not listed in the annexure this is a shell not an agreement we ultimately put our trust in the recommendation of the dg but are clear that any questions of operation can be discussed at any time in the board this by no way means we are also giving endorsement under nsg
280111 this decision is one of a series in the us india nuclear agreement ireland will be engaged with the nsg with a view to maintain the views of the non proliferation regime the established practice here is to take consensus if there would have been a vote we would have abstained
280112 we would like greater clarity as a member of the nsg we will continue to pay close attention
280113 i have been saying for many years that if you really want a universal non proliferation regime you cannot achieve that when one fifth of world population is excluded that is common sense india is not coming as a non nuclear weapon state but they are taking a step in the right direction as director general the agreement is solid and there is no exception to basic rules

280133 i think i need a woman would you like to be her
280134 plaintiffs present largely uncontested descriptive statistics which show that women working at wal mart stores are paid less than men in every region that pay disparities exist in most job categories that the salary gap widens over time that women take longer to enter management positions and that the higher one looks in the organization the lower the percentage of women
280135 im the first to concede that the costco case is nowhere in the same league as the wal mart case
280136 ive done 50 class actions in my time and wal mart stands out above all of them both in terms of the depth and pattern of discrimination and in their reaction to the charges
280137 i told walton you can approach this one of two ways hold people down and pay me or some other lawyer to make it work

280159 it was not his mistake it was mine i said to them before the game that if it went to penalties i would choose the players to take them i told them it was my choice and if we didnt win it would be my mistake
280160 i have got other players who can take penalties ballack and drogba it is something we need to improve on if they win a penalty competition they will have more confidence
280161 he had to move to another country and the environment changed
280162 hes trying to play the way he can i believe we have seen many times he has great talent if he overcomes these problems which are mostly psychological and i think because he moved to a different country then he will achieve a lot in the chelsea team
280163 i came here to look at my team for the game against portsmouth
280164 i have 75 per cent of my team now maybe i have 85 per cent
280165 he wanted to leave i am certain although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters

280182 it spins on its tail and water gurgles up and splashes down that bit of water sound drowns out urban noise and makes my backyard feel like an oasis
280183 i picked up a copper pipe from a local garage sale and decided to hook up a pump to it
280184 then i got it to sprinkle water when it was finished a neighbor saw it and wanted to buy it as a gift for her father
280185 its garden art first and a sprinkler second because it wont be sprinkling much of the time
280186 but its a dynamic art so you have to create a design thats balanced while spinning because you want them to create a beautiful cascade of water believe me they take quite a bit of tweaking to get right

280192 were making this a festival and a celebration of golf
280193 when you dont have emotion and passion it ends up being just a golf tournament
280194 but that is the fundamental thing that made the cost structure of it tilt against bells continued interest and tilt in favour of a company like rbc which is building its brand outside of canada
280195 a roofing contractor for instance can knock a thousand dollars off a 6 000 job because he can absorb the loss into labor costs
280196 thats why home renovations and repairs is one area where youll see actual price decreases for consumers instead of just price freezes
280197 a recession is always a good buying opportunity for house hunters
280198 youll get a better rate if you renew your mortgage and a recession is also good for lines of credit tied to prime
280199 its a political gesture toward an embattled government in colombia
280200 these are political agreements not trade agreements they should not be sold as agreements that are an important part of canadas trade strategy
280201 canada should be pursuing a much more aggressive strategy with the u s to deal with excessive security at the border and regulatory differences
280202 we shouldnt fool ourselves into thinking that pursuing such things as ftas with little countries has a macro impact
280203 whenever the u s negotiates a bilateral trade deal canada comes along and says why dont you give us the same terms that makes it easier to negotiate
280204 after challenger blew up in 1985 reagan announced that the u s government was no longer going to be the sole body taking satellites and other such cargo up into orbit

280209 most companies images and reputations are built slowly and are slow to erode which is good because when there is a crisis you can bounce back if you handle it well or people will forget eventually
280210 this has skewed our perception to the point where the entire event feels essentially like a commercial enterprise
280211 and comes with huge opportunities for hospitality rewarding employees and other benefits that are beyond public opinion you cant judge whether the olympics is good or bad on the basis of public opinion
280212 if im going to go out and buy a computer who am i going to think about maybe at that time lenovo may be one of the top three because youve seen their name over and over again and its associated with somebody who has done very well
280213 the sponsorship is designed to be a brand introduction technique for the most part
280214 by the time the games are over we will have succeeded on that specific goal
280215 our basic message is if lenovo can do this for the olympics imagine what lenovo can do for you and imagine what lenovo can do for your company
280216 its more than just connecting the name and the brand to the organization
280217 its also lenovo becoming an active participant in the overall management of that season or sports event
280218 buzz is kind of the seed that grows into a reputation and it occurs through multiple fronts
280219 its not just the media its not just sponsorships its experience with the store its using the products its all the ways that you touch the public
280220 you should expect to pay at least 300 more for a cpo car than you would for the same car bought at an independent dealer
280221 selling carbon credits is just a joke it repositions it somewhere else and does not solve the problem

280224 it was quite a surprise not even the board was aware
280225 theyre spending a lot of their engineering expertise on retrofitting the old product so its hard for them to spend time and effort on new products
280226 they always say every quarter they have a bid or theyve had people ask for quotes
280227 the difficult news this morning is that we thought we were getting a patch but we havent gotten anything
280228 essentially were at the same place as we were yesterday before apple released the patch
280229 were experiencing huge pressure here on the farm and thats why weve gone to the commission to ask for an adjustment
280230 fuel increased by about 40 fertilizers and herbicides are up 50 there are also all the internalized prices in everything else we use such as fuel surcharges for deliveries of all kinds of goods we use
280231 we were already concerned last december with some of these looming price increases
280232 fertilizer was already staring to gain some momentum in terms of the fairly dramatic price increases that are coming now we alerted the commission that this was coming down the pike and i dont think they really took that into consideration
280233 they will continue to see elevated prices for a lot of their input costs whether its energy or feed or some of the other components of their businesses that means they are not about to see any relief anytime soon in the second half of this year or next year

280239 consumption will remain supportive to the economy but it will not be the engine of growth experienced in the past
280240 u s consumers are being ground down by the cumulative effects of high gasoline and food prices a falling stock market weakening housing values and a shaky job market unfortunately these negative conditions are likely to persist well beyond when the last of the tax rebate checks is cashed in july consequently consumer sentiment is unlikely to reach healthy levels anytime soon

280297 compliments of cnn we dont know where mccain stands on the issues but we do know that he stands in a pair of 500 italian shoes cnn spends more time talking about senator mccains fashion than about my campaign

280299 everything we have accomplished here at townebank truly stands as a tribute to those in the community who have supported us

280304 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
280305 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
280306 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
280307 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
280308 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric

280311 there are some democrats who think things are going to look a lot different in the makeup of the next congress and why dont we just wait until we are more advantaged
280312 its my hope that theyll come back in september chastened by their constituents and ready to work with republicans on tackling the facing this nation

280324 plaintiffs privacy claims fail among other reasons because the view of a home from the driveway that can be seen by any visitor delivery person or telephone repairman is not private
280325 todays satellite image technology means that complete privacy does not exist
280326 plaintiffs live in the 21st century united states where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass unless there is a clear expression such as a gate fence or keep out sign indicating that the public is not permitted to enter anyone may approach a home by a walkway driveway or any other route commonly used by visitors without liability for trespass
280327 q does this lead us to rethink privacy and how we protect it
280328 although the word privacy is not found in the constitution brandeis had long believed privacy one of the most precious rights he and samuel warren had written a pioneering law review article on the subject in 1890 and he returned to the theme in his dissent in olmstead v u s 1928 the court had held that wiretapping did not constitute a violation of the fourth amendment and brandeis objected to this invasion of privacy the makers of our constitution he declared conferred as against the government the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men p 478 ultimately the court adopted the idea of a constitutionally protected right of privacy in griswold v connecticut 1965

280336 i dont know the inside scoop of what happened at pc world but you can bet that pat mcgovern was in the mix empowering people like bob carrigan to make the right decision in the end in the news cycle this might seem like a flash in the pan story about journalism but for me its a story about respect and good business in the long term hats off to idg and pat mcgovern

280340 is probably not going to become law before any supplemental that is passed in september
280341 this planet is part of a larger federation was part of an earlier federation and passed out of its control due to losses in war and other such things
280342 in the last ten thousand years they have gone on with a sort of a decadent kicked in the head civilization that contains automobiles business suits fedora hats telephones spaceships quite interesting but a civilization which looks an almost exact duplicate but is worse off than the current u
280343 they had turbine generated cars that went about 275 miles an hour they ran with a high whine i notice theyve just now invented the motor again and they had tracks that were booby trapped with atom bombs and they had side bypasses the tracks were mined and the grandstands were leaded paned and the audience it got to be kind of a no audience you never could see the audience and oh they had loose sand sections and they had slick oil asphalt and they had ice sections and loose gravel any kind of hazards you could think of a mountain that you went up to the top of and fell off you know and just there were just more drivers killed there was more blood pouring on that track you see all the time i mean it was always goofed up ten twelve thousand years this was the favorite sport of the marcab confederacy apparently
280344 youve probably often wondered what that needle like pinging was in the back of your neck well you probably wound up on the track some time or another as a driver or something of the sort
280345 the marcab confederacys medicine was so excellent that an individual just couldnt die out of it
280346 if a person was considered to be in contempt of court or anything like that he was simply fried since there was a curtain of radioactive material which went clear across the front of the bench anywhere that a witness or anybody would stand and so on
280347 they invented income tax as a means of punishment with the death penalty imposed for making even the slightest mistake in returns one comma wrong and its dead forever
280348 and that is the history of the universe the human race the fifth invaders the fourth invaders the 3 1 2 invaders the people on mars saturn jupiter arcturus the marcab galaxy the marcab system the psi galaxy galaxy 82
280349 why a lot of people get racial upsets is because there are really about 15 at least 12 or 15 thetan races here on earth and theyre scattered all through these five human races which is beautiful randomity if there ever was any theres the snake men theres the invaders i wont bother putting them down youll recognize then one of these days ill have to make up a table ive got to do this research myself i havent picked up this research ive i can do all the job they should have done over the last 80 million years here in the last couple but i i it takes a little time uh not much but they youve got your invader people youve got a crew of well let me tell you the classifications they fall into here
280350 all right you take your snake man just as far as processing is concerned theres nothing easier where this becomes interesting is in terms of behavior and you dont care about that either your snake mans going around hes very quiet he wants you to prove everything prove prove prove prove and if theres any gadget made under the sun which is mechanical that will restimulate an incident which he finds hes bound to find it and turn it out somehow or other or make some preclear test it prove prove prove prove
280351 another ones the cat people god knows where the cat people came from lord lord lord these people are sure lost most of them are mad as hatters and they have huge huge often slanted they theyll take the ge and they will change the ges eyes to large and slanted theyll make the ge grow very thin and the eyes will be big and quite often uh uh very feline and theyre lost they dont know where they are and they kinda look like cats and theyll talk to you about catbirds from some place or another
280352 but what do we find in their case we find out that cats are a cant destroy and then there are other people who are similar to that that find cats that cant destroy that arent part of the cat people because to be a good valid cat person one of the first requisites is to be strictly fruitcake and very thin theyre really lost i dont know who got hold of the cat people or where or brought them in to the track but they spin as quick as you look at them youve known some of them im sure theyre kind of sweet and theyre kind of anxious to help and theyre kind of starry eyed and theyre not very forceful theyre very weak
280353 now then heres your monitor people the female of that species weve decided to call the merrimacks after that ancient battle so these people you want them the test on them they by the way this is peculiar to a lot of these other races so it isnt a singular test these people love to wear hornrimmed spectacles if you could let them go around with spornrimmed hecticles on and no glasses in the in them theyd be happy thats because your monitor wears heavy goggles during fac one and so on but dont mention insects to these people because theyll ordinarily just go off the pin theyve got something to do with insects i dont know what these people are quite salvageable by the way
280354 but theyre organizers par excellence and youll find them out in the society doing terrific jobs of organization
280355 the invader boys present a hard case mostly because they start feeling very degraded and there are several crews of those by the way theres not just one crew and all of them feel more or less degraded but the third battalion of the fifth invader force is practically out through the bottom of the chute youd have to invent something below minus eight
280356 and there was the fourth invader force was here the fifth invader force came in to use this area and the name of this solar system is space station 33 they started to use this area without suspecting that the fourth invader force had been there for god knows how many skillion years had been sitting down and they have their installations up on mars and they have a tremendous screened operation
280357 the martian operation is a fascinating operation simply because it has gone into 100 percent holding force
280358 well now the point is that the fifth invader force operated for some little time here in this system without suspecting the existence of the fourth invader force
280359 and a battalion was sent down here to earth 8 200 years ago the third battalion if you find somebody who is a member of the third battalion why speak up because the whole battalion its officers staff and so forth was under the command of the expeditionary force commanding officer for this not for just this area
280360 so 8 200 years ago they came down in the himalayas the upper headlands up about oh id say about seventy two miles northwest of khyber pass and put a base in there and still not believing that there was anything like an invader force operating in this system failed to take any vaguest precautions with regard to their installations they put up no defenses after all what was here nothing but homo sapiens that was just nothing no danger no menace and so on
280361 and they were in this installation just a very short time when all of a sudden with a terrific crash the fourth invader force which was a little more active then than it has become since knocked out this whole battalion a battalion of that size is in the neighborhood of about three thousand beings and picked up all of its staff all of its staff officers and so forth and took them through to mars and then knocked them back into this human race here theyre still here there are saucer crews here theres all sorts of things on earth here from the fifth invader force very interesting
280362 this is directly and violently in opposition to the fourth invader force and the fifth invader force out of its own protection took over venus oh relatively in modern times took over venus and tried to stabilize the venusian
280363 if you called a fifth invader though a venusian he would probably shoot you out of hand because it would be a horrible insult they merely monitor the government of venus and they leave mars strictly alone
280364 but completely aside from that fact earth has been used consistently as a prison and it is a prison and it is heavily screened there are installations in mongolia there are installations in the pyrenees here on earth and there are installations down in the mountains of the moon in africa which pick up very often people on death
280365 oh boy what have we got here ha ha wonderful wonderful a high volume thetan he must be a space officer from some place or other
280366 where have i been for the last twenty seven years
280367 we have record enforcement numbers in every area of enforcement

280369 its a substantial increase on both employers and criminal arrests overall
280370 questions about whether they meet the requirements of due process
280371 i think our agency has taken extraordinary steps to ensure that we are identifying not only humanitarian concerns but ensuring that all appropriate due process is followed
280372 i think the bottom line is some people dont want us to enforce the law
280373 what we are seeing from industry and from business is increased interest in compliance
280374 they do not want to be on the wrong side of an ice enforcement action
280375 were trying to make it harder to sneak into this country and harder to stay here illegally were doing that in every way possible
280376 most other schools will open september 2nd we realize that for schools like earle that were on a nine month calendar this is a major change

280378 i dont like to come in real early my mom is going to try and wake me up early but im gonna get through it
280379 i personally feel that students need more than just reading and writing they need those other activities
280380 it keeps the kids off the streets and it helps them

280404 i also want to mention ted grintjes the suddenly maligned chair of the 27 th street steering committee i dont know him that well but i know of him franklin owes a lot of gratitude to him for his work in getting northwestern mutual life and wheaton franciscan here i would remind everyone that this man is a volunteer giving countless hours of his time and expertise i do hope he doesnt get frustrated and continues on because if he should step away and im not suggesting thats a possibility in any way shape or form franklin would be hard pressed to find a replacement with his institutional knowledge or volunteer time for that matter

280418 could grow dramatically if the results of dr schatzbergs government sponsored research find that mifepristone could be used to treat psychotic major depression
280419 despite our belief that stanford nimh and dr schatzberg have handled this grant in accordance with the regulations and applicable policies and with due regard for the integrity of the research we can see how having dr schatzberg continue as the principal investigator on the grant can create an appearance of conflict of interest and we want to eliminate that concern
280420 were trying to get our guys a little feeling for what they might do and get ready for the game
280421 it has been a good week of preparation i think our guys are excited about it im looking forward to visiting the hall of fame and seeing if we can win a game also
280422 for the most part its just going to be going out there preparing to play and letting our system handle things
280423 our first offense may play a little more than our first defense then midway through the first quarter well start to get a look at our younger guys and guys we want to see
280424 but i would say its probably likely the offense will play a little more than the defense
280425 they newly signed reserve quarterbacks jaren lorenzen and quinn gray are doing well weve got things scaled down for them which is good but theyre doing well in their first two weeks here
280426 jim sorgi will play a little more than colts quarterback peyton manning normally would have played we wont necessarily have all the first group in with him all the time but hell get his share of work
280427 ive started before in the preseason so that wont be anything different
280428 in the last game of the preseason peyton sometimes doesnt play so i get to start usually its at cincinnati so it sunday is just a game
280429 hes had games where he knew he was going to play the majority of the game but going in starting and getting us off to a good start will be new for him i expect once that first series goes hell be fine
280430 peyton likes to take as many reps as he can in practice so jim hasnt always gotten the chance to get in there and work with us as much as hed like to but i like what i see
280431 hes doing a great job hes leading the ship just like we want him to
280432 its another game its special to play in the hall of fame game and special to play in the first preseason game of the year but ive started in the preseason before i know how to go out there and what the mindset is to play and hopefully win the ballgame thats the kind of mindset im going to take into the game
280433 im not going to go out there and try to do too much

280460 there is a personal experience but it moves away from being centered on the one machine
280461 all i need today is an internet connection and a web browser
280462 to get someone else to do it someone really big
280463 a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
280464 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
280465 i dont think he obama did himself any good with these comments what he did is inject back into this context the idea about voters comfort level
280466 what he said is not exactly rap talk black speak but that is something that obama has to be very careful about he just cant let people believe that they cant trust him
280467 i will say that the way that theyve amplified this you know has been troublesome and the eagerness with which theyve done it indicates they think they can exploit this politically
280468 but in fact what i have said and theres no doubt about this theyve said it themselves is that they want to make me appear risky to the american people
280469 because obama has had less than one term in the senate and people dont know much about him and he is different in terms of race there will be some americans who are uncertain about the kind of change he is offering
280470 our job is to make sure that they understand that the changes were promoting are changes that have to be made that if we dont make them in fact thats the riskier course
280471 we will need enormous commitment energy discipline and drive if we are going to reflect the enormity of the challenges in front of us there is absolutely no room for complacency
280472 he continued to live the lifestyle of a grad student no frills
280473 were looking at a man with a distinguished 30 something year career unparalleled and known around the world
280474 his career and his reputation are trashed and the fbi still hasnt said what they have on him
280475 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
280476 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
280477 we knew they were looking at someone we knew that bruce worked at fort detrick we knew he worked with pathogens
280478 its not like you might say the person gave off vibes that they might be a dangerous person
280479 the thing is i hate drunk drivers living in l a i cant stand them and thats why i was so disappointed in myself i wanted to prove to the court that i would take it completely seriously so i went to rehab to prove i was sober
280480 it really helped in getting the more serious aspects of my case dropped because you know thats what they want to hear youre not an alcoholic and you dont have a problem
280481 theyre taking it slow testing the waters theyve gone on a few friendly dates
280482 it was really cute first heather proposed to carolyn then carolyn proposed to her theyve been together for over a year it was love at first sight

280484 we didnt lose anything today im delighted with the dismissal we won and in essence our lawsuit against gibson remains totally intact
280485 law governing an acceptable filming distance from an unwilling subject to keep everybody safe and misbehavior accountable
280486 i dont sit before you today to ask that you ban the paparazzi im asking you to regulate it officialize it tax it legitimize it
280487 it was a very funny radio show like a funny banter going back and forth and thats what came out of my mouth obviously im joking still i dont believe in what the t shirt said i didnt say sorry
280488 no i dont have a boyfriend im looking but im too busy but im 16 and i like to go on dates and i have crushes and stuff
280489 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead

280493 there isnt a way for us to operate properly without this
280494 it was hard for voters in the northern reaches of oakland county to understand the benefits of their tax dollars going to benefit venues in dearborn or vice versa
280495 ten bucks a year to keep the zoo open is nothing i pay more than that for coffee every week
280496 we need this place to stay open for our kids
280497 peter lark has done an exemplary job in his first year at the bwl the company and the community are lucky to have someone of his caliber heading up michigans largest public utility
280498 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal

280503 i know that but i got traded to pittsburgh for brian giles in essence and once again it wasnt quite the grand scale of this one but its something i cant control im not going to be manny ramirez i know that im going to try to do what i can do kind of going through what ive gone through i think im equipped to handle that youve got to go out and play the game i understand that that stuff is out there but thats beyond my control
280504 its going to be something ill probably never forget thats for sure i cant wait everyone says the best fans in baseball are here and i cant wait to be a part of the home team
280505 pack a bag get on a flight get here meet the entire team and an entire staff and then go out there and play a game and all of a sudden just have it click that youve been submersed in the middle of a pennant race and you have a chance to win a ring
280506 i dont think its going to resonate that quick i think i might need a day or two to let it sink in i fully intend to let it sink in
280507 it was slim pickings when it came down to the numbers
280508 eric davis was a childhood idol of mine and he wore no 44 so why not
280509 i just went home and packed my bag and got here at 1 oclock
280510 my name was everywhere and the deadline passed and i thought all that and nothing all of a sudden a half hour after the deadline i get called into the office and they say youve been traded if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to go to i dont think
280511 they havent seen me and i havent seen them so they really had no idea how i was going to attack them
280512 i know we threw a lot of off speed stuff theyre a really good fastball hitting team and sometimes thats what you got to do to win i mean i walked four guys but it didnt hurt me
280513 one team has a disadvantage nobody faced him before he changed speeds well good changeup good breaking ball

280526 stracka com allows golfers to post hole by hole scores and interact while they are on the course
280527 live scoring on stracka com will be a great addition to club tournaments so regular golfers can have their own leader board live on the internet
280528 we used live scoring for our 2008 club championship and it was great to watch the scores come in on the internet it was like watching the pros play on tv
280529 some of our projects around here will be at risk if we cant move the coal to port
280530 we were given ironclad guarantees that the infrastructure would be kept up to scratch after the freight rail privatisation
280531 after consideration of various locations in nsw the site in the oberon local government area was selected by the applicant due to sufficient local energy demand suitable wind conditions and available infrastructure
280532 the project will generate 32 construction stage jobs and one full time operational position and potentially fuel investment in the local area

280539 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
280540 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
280541 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
280542 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
280543 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
280544 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
280545 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
280546 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
280547 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
280548 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
280549 as popular or unpopular as it is for as tough or as difficult as it is i think the organization has stood strong
280550 theyre decisive and theyre continuing to work through this everyone wants this resolved dont get me wrong no one thought it would get to this point but this is where we are

280577 now i can tell everyone that i will sign a contract im feeling very good here and at the moment my heart is with arsenal
280578 this club has given me a lot of things it gave me a chance to be who i am today so i have to thank them and i think the boss understands that as well we have to work hard together as a family and to deliver better than what we did last season
280579 when we started talking about my contract i never told him manager arsene wenger id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
280580 my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father hes my boss so whatever he tells me ill do it our relationship at the moment is strong
280581 im very confident we have a squad to compete at the top level in the premier league if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it we need one more body in there
280582 i dont think that the best tactic is to come out with names if we can do one more signing we will do but it will need to be quality
280583 he was serving well and i threw in a lot of unforced errors but once i got going i played really well
280584 ive never been to the final of a masters but this looks like my best chance hopefully im playing well enough and can come through

280590 i informed him the politburo member of my inability to accept such a decision or to act upon the same as it will seriously compromise the constitutional position of the speaker
280591 i had consciously taken the principled position to uphold the constitution of india at the risk of being unjustifiably dubbed as anti party
280592 a partys contention that while as speaker a member of parliament should continue to be under the direction and control of the party a convention should start now that during his tenure as speaker a member should temporarily resign from the party membership

280598 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
280599 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivinss case it led to his untimely death

280609 we are scared so i am taking my son home
280610 we were told about vedants death he fell into a bucket in bathroom we didnt make any deep enquiry
280611 we found this school was the best it gives deeksha shiksha and sanskar
280612 we are not ruling the possibility of a homicide but we have nothing to base it on from the post mortem report of ramkrishna yadav it clearly says the doctors have no definite opinion about the cause of the death there are no injury marks anywhere
280613 we are not ruling out anything including a possible conspiracy angle
280614 the prayer had started around 6 p m but vedant wasnt there later he was found dead in the bathroom the kids dont talk freely before the police so we are trying other ways we are also profiling the sadhaks
280615 there is a need to maintain the independence of judiciary because otherwise everyday complaints would be filed against them and judges would be in the dock no judge will be able to pass any order as he does

280643 we are awaiting more chips from the rest of the bombs that have been found in surat it is likely that a team from here would go to these companies in bangalore and even they might visit us
280644 this is a new kind of bomb that can be planned to go off over an unspecified period of time unlike the earlier timer devices which would go off within 12 hours it needs to be studied in detail
280645 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time

280781 di fatto avete maggiori probabilit di morire in un incidente dauto lungo la via che conduce al negozio in cui state andando ad acquistare il vostro biglietto della lotteria che non di vincere il montepremi
280782 se avete paura di morire dovete fare esercizio e mangiare bene per evitare malattie cardiovascolari e smettere di fumare per prevenire il cancro ai polmoni e assai piu sensato prendersi cura della propria salute che non preoccuparsi di venire uccisi e se cmq lomicidio vi spaventa piu sensato avere paura di un membro della famiglia che non di uno sconosciuto questa la realta dei fatti basta sulle probabilta
280783 per anni giovani donne brillanti hanno perseguito la loro carriera con mentalita da single presupponendo che una volta che fosse arrivato il momento di trovare marito avrebbero potuto prendere la matita e disegnarne uno si sbagliavano poi contro ogni probabilta il newsweek dichiarava che una donna nubile di quarantanni aveva piu possibilita di venire uccisa da un terrorista che non di trovare marito

280792 wat je vaak ziet is dat mensen nog moeten wennen aan vista
280793 vooral de kleine bedrijven die geen eigen it afdeling hebben schakelen liever terug naar windows xp dat ze gewoon beter kennen

280798 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
280799 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
280800 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
280801 elephants also are a major part of ecotourism which is an important source of hard currency for many african countries
280802 public support stopped the illegal ivory trade back in 1989 and can do so again
280803 the work with dna sampling allows us to focus law enforcement on poaching hot spots
280804 it forces countries to take more responsibility for what goes on within their borders and it also gives us more insight on where to look so that hopefully we can stop the poachers before the elephants are actually killed
280805 the mere accessing and reading of privileged information is criminal
280806 this case however went well beyond just reading someones e mail
280807 as we continually have said from day one larry has been cooperating fully with the investigators

280809 impossible for alycia to continue to report the news as she herself has become the focus of so many news stories
280810 we decided to enter the contest because my friends are somewhat obsessed with heinz ketchup and like to have it ready before the food even arrives
280811 we thought it would be difficult to win but in the end it all paid off
280812 the winning ad visually represents americas love of the thick rich taste of heinz ketchup and shows that no table is complete without it
280813 were excited for matt and for all the finalists whose passion and creativity is inspiring
280814 oh my word i cant believe i didnt even think of it once today
280815 i had the most wonderful time of my life tonight and i really dont want it to end can we go somewhere you and i and watch the stars
280816 once again we find ourselves in a spirited competition to find the next great ketchup ad which has been a starting point for some of todays well known celebrities
280817 we are excited about the thousands of inventive ads submitted and we look forward to tallying the votes and discovering who america chooses as the winner
280818 heinz is deeply committed to reducing its environmental footprint and protecting natural resources for future generations

280832 las pol ticas de la omc priorizan siempre los intereses econ micos de las grandes empresas y potencias comerciales violando as permanentemente el derecho a vivir dignamente de las personas m s vulnerables y marginalizadas
280833 negociar un acuerdo entre siete potencias comerciales y excluir el resto de los pa ses de la omc evidencia la falta de legitimidad de estas reuniones
280834 la gran mayoria de los 35 ministros de comercio que han sido invitados a ginebra preseleccionados de un total de 153 estados miembros pasaron la mayor parte del tiempo esperando frustrados los resultados del g7 eeuu ue jap n australia china india brasil
280835 el paquete de apertura de mercados y los recortes arancelarios que se ped an a los pa ses en desarrollo propuesto por el director general de la omc pascal lamy hubiera causado p rdidas masivas de empleo
280836 y demuestra la intransigencia de las potencias comerciales que no est n interesadas en proteger los peque os agricultores y los puestos de trabajo
280837 mientras la ue y los eeuu argumentan que la apertura de mercados es la mejor forma de conseguir la seguridad alimentaria india y china defienden los mecanismos de protecci n y no est n dispuestos a consagrar otras preocupaciones s lo por el comercio
280838 se culpa a india y china por el colapso de las negociaciones pero son m s de 100 pa ses que no quieren sacrificar medidas de seguridad alimentaria ante la reciente escalada en los precios de los alimentos a nivel mundial
280839 la negociaci n fracas porque la ue y eeuu s lo quer an consolidar su dominio y control en los mercados internacionales de comercio e inversi n
280840 est n pujando de forma agresiva por una mayor liberalizaci n comercial cuando es el modelo de libre comercio que ha provocado la crisis alimentaria destruyendo los mercados alimentarios y agr colas
280841 la gente est protestando en la calle por los altos precios de su comida mientras hay una crisis energ tica por la falta de voluntad pol tica de cambiar el modelo econ mico hay despidos masivos por la crisis financiera y hay millones de refugiados por el cambio clim tico
280842 estos son los problemas que los gobiernos deber an afrontar pero la ronda de doha no les ayuda sino que el modelo de comercio que promueve la omc agrava estas crisis porque es una de las mayores causas del calentamiento global si el gobierno espa ol quiere de verdad reducir los devastadores impactos del cambio clim tico eliminar las causas de la pobreza y afrontar la crisis financiera debe cambiar urgentemente su pol tica comercial
280843 el desacuerdo en la omc sirve tambi n a los campesinos europeos para evidenciar la desaparici n de explotaciones agrarias as como para denunciar la responsabilidad de la ue y su pol tica agraria com n pac por la crisis de la agricultura y la alimentaci n que se vive en europa

280866 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
280867 barack obama thinks hes the one but is he ready to lead
280868 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
280869 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
280870 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
280871 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
280872 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene it is not about race
280873 using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
280874 i think they should probably be a little less paranoid about parsing every word we say and a little more focused on actually addressing the challenges that americans expect the president of the united states to take on
280875 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
280876 hes not from central casting when it comes to candidates for president of the united states hes new to washington yes hes african american
280877 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
280878 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects they heard something that senator obama said and they felt they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics
280879 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates but that i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phoney allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
280880 no se corresponde con la voluntad de las autoridades y no es sistem tico

280921 con las leyes org nicas se pretende fundamentalmente que las materias reguladas por stas tengan mayor estabilidad que aquellas materias que son propias de las leyes ordinarias dada la especial rigidez de aquellas normas respecto de stas cuya aprobaci n y ulterior modificaci n o derogaci n se somete a requisitos especiales como el concurso m s amplio de voluntades en la asamblea nacional en cuanto regulan la materia de que se trate aunque la ratio del n mero de leyes org nicas tanto por determinaci n constitucional como las que derivan de un criterio material incluidas en el texto constitucional encierran diversas motivaciones p

280934 the new direction congress led by democrats has offered real solutions to bring down energy costs promote renewable fuels and energy efficiency and promote oil production right here in america but a majority of congressional republicans have voted no each time they should go home to their districts and explain their record of obstructing common sense proposals to address the pain at the pump being felt by american consumers and businesses
280935 interests as hostile to the american people as any invading army could be and vastly more dangerous interests that manipulate the prosperity produced by all so that it heaps up riches for the few interests whose growth and power can only mean the degradation of the people

280952 of those women we were able to follow 418 women who gave birth vaginally had a second child or more were tested for gbs during their first and second pregnancies and were not excluded from the study due to various factors we found that of the 418 the risk of testing positive for gbs during a second pregnancy was 53 percent
280953 our study did not tackle this issue but the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
280954 the test involves a swab of the vaginal rectal area if a woman tests positive and is therefore considered colonized she will most likely be treated with intravenous iv antibiotic therapy during labor the antibiotics will help protect the infant
280955 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies md lead author of the study and director of the respiratory division at
280956 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
280957 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
280958 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
280959 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
280960 ours is by far the largest case control study of flu vaccine in the elderly
280961 we tried to overcome the limits of previous studies done by others
280962 those studies may have overestimated the benefits of the flu vaccine in the elderly for various reasons
280963 they are less likely than younger healthier seniors to go out and get vaccinated and more apt to develop pneumonia
280964 thats why our study used a control time period after flu vaccine became available but before each flu season actually started
280965 because those who got the vaccine happened to be healthier not because the flu vaccine was protecting them from pneumonia caused by the flu since it wasnt present yet
280966 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
280967 the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
280968 people age 65 and older should still get yearly flu vaccines as usual
280969 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
280970 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
280971 that may be because women in high risk groups have a greater risk of acquiring hiv from causes other than bv this could be helpful information in identifying which populations would be helped most through targeted bacterial vaginosis control measures

280973 sexual abuse is any sexual act between an adult and a minor or between two minors when one party exerts power over the other
280974 if your child broke her arm you would know which doctor you would go to you were going to have your insurance card in your pocket be prepared in the same way with child sexual abuse

280976 we have a lot of bridges in new york state that need repair

280979 the legislature worked hard to vote on as many bills as possible but they just simply ran out of time on several issues including the right to repair act
280980 thanks to the enthusiastic work of the massachusetts automotive aftermarket led by the alliance of automotive service providers of massachusetts aasp ma right to repair continues to be well received by a majority of legislators in massachusetts
280981 there is much credible evidence that automakers and importers are holding back data
280982 it right to repair act deserves a favorable recommendation not just for the benefit of the independent shops but also for their customers
280983 the next few months will be crucial for massachusettss motoring consumers and automotive aftermarket repair shops who continue to need and want a competitive affordable quality option in their vehicle repairs

281043 what we think of as a computer and what we think of as it in general is likely to change
281044 the intelligent systems will move from being information systems to intelligent systems that will carry out a whole variety of tasks that we just won amp apos t think of as computing tasks the technology will find its way into so many things we do and we won amp apos t even think about it the explicit way we amp apos ve done computing in the past will be there but it will be a very small subset of what we amp apos ll be doing
281045 when you think back on where we were decades ago computers were still things that largely sat in big rooms behind big windows and were attended to by computing gurus or priests
281046 in the 40 years we amp apos ve just completely changed the way people think about computers and computing it amp apos s gone from a very expensive very exclusive kind of technology to something that is unquestionably ubiquitous from the computers on our desks to the computers in our cell phones
281047 when you see how intense the reaction is to things like the iphone with its use of touch and its sensitivity to motion you begin to get a sense of amp apos gee if machines understand the physical world and were capable of reacting to our voices to our movements and gestures and touch how much closer would we feel to them
281048 at the same time of course we would like the ability to become more a part of these artificial or virtual worlds that are created entirely within the machine we amp apos re starting to see with things like google the ability of these machines to create these worlds that are much more comfortable for us to experience and be a part of

281063 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
281064 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
281065 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
281066 lets all flee and wait for our protectors to show up
281067 the passengers had blocked the assailant inside the bus but let him out before the police arrived so they could beat him to death however several of the passengers were seriously maimed before the police could subdue him three passengers lost a limb and two received life threatening injuries when their arteries were severed
281068 weve had a lot of feedback from customers and partners and theyre very interested in seeing these devices with windows on them
281069 we have seen much demand for windows on the eee pc
281070 it is great that microsoft is addressing this customer demand and providing a windows solution on these devices which will provide a familiar computing experience
281071 weve had standalone internet devices come out before not too many of them have been successful but now we are getting towards the right price points
281072 how theyll land and who will buy them we dont really know yet but well wait and see
281073 web sites had put the price at under us 800 but that may not be the case
281074 we have worked closely with them around flexibility and protection of ip
281075 zune will control the price of the episodes but were open to understanding which episodes can be priced lower and how we may introduce premium content which may be priced higher than 1 99

281079 its not personal dammit stop planting deer food and they wont come
281080 tim ill have to let you go weve got another deer emergency

281082 i may not have been raised on a farm but im
281083 that deer is as dead as you can get and her fawn is over there on the other side of our creek
281084 well have to approach very quietly or we might scare it
281085 listen if that doe died after giving birth she probably was too old or too sick to survive it that might mean she wasnt able to feed this little thing either and thats not good if animal services cant get any milk into her she wont make it
281086 sadly the reason we cant do this as well inside our own species is because there are those who would as soon call you crazy as be touched by your experience
281087 the ability to look at our enemy or what we think is our enemy and see ourselves people animals that just want what we do
281088 i didnt know lavender was a greek flower good to know
281089 i want to be the next president of the united states
281090 its not the turkish people we greeks dislike its their government
281091 this isnt working time to start over lets start by having a tea party
281092 i cant care about what our government does all over the world i have to trust that they know what theyre doing
281093 the first overarching big problem is to make the good person we must have better human beings or else it is quite possible that we may all be wiped out and even if not wiped out certainly live in tension and anxiety as a a species

281095 when she uses an attack you can see her skin is revealed because she needs her hair to make the magic happen you can see a lot of skin there
281096 we take strong exception to any contention that we failed to perform a continuous search of our rail for internal defects or that our inspection and maintenance program is inadequate in fact many of our procedures exceed fra standards
281097 norfolk southern used the best available track inspection technology and procedures at the time and used an expert rail defect detection contractor to inspect its rails at a frequency that exceeds fra requirements it is highly unlikely that any changes to ns technology and procedures could have uncovered the flaw that caused the derailment
281098 norfolk southern has the lowest track caused accident rate among all class 1 railroads
281099 any suggestion that we short cut track safety goes against the facts and is counter to our policy and practice
281100 wow does it feel good to be back in the car
281101 when we rolled the dollar general honda off the truck it was really a special moment for me because things have came around for us and were back on track im here today as the racecar driver and was able to leave the owner hat at the shop no paperwork bills or payroll just racecar driving i feel like im on vacation i guess racecar driving is like yoga for me very relaxing overall our test went extremely well we brought a new engineer down with us and we have been working seamlessly together the car feels good and we have a great baseline of consistency in the car we dealt with a lot of heat today which wont be as much of the case race weekend with it being a night race i cant wait to get back in the car next weekend
281102 im very pleased with our test here at kentucky speedway we worked on consistent long runs with sarah in the dollar general car and continued to get quicker we werent able to run in traffic but our main goal was really just to build consistency in her car with it being my first time with the team i also had to get to know everyone on the team but great test overall
281103 this is one of the better tests that ive been to i havent seen this consistent of a racecar in a long time i really cant complain about anything sarah was running a great line and was just consistent in her driving we could do a bit of tuning up on the car but we will be ready for next weekend everyone has worked so hard these last few months from bringing on board dollar general converting all the pit equipment and car over to yellow and getting the car ready to run we are excited to be back on track

281108 in tokyo where a maglev train is being planned the population density is 5000 people per square kilometre we have 300

281114 he looked at me and his little face was getting redder and redder

281116 if we feel his life is being disadvantaged by it at any point we would definitely do it
281117 id hate him to be teased we live in a small community which is lovely
281118 the killing of this serbian born father of two is believed to be linked with organised crime and detectives believe mr sekuljicas death was the result of a contract killing
281119 during this investigation we have identified a number of persons of interest and are continuing to make inquiries into their association with mr sekuljica
281120 rewards provide an incentive for some people to come forward to police with information they have previously withheld
281121 since this reward was announced police have received some information from the community which is now being pursued
281122 police have maintained contact with mr sekuljicas family throughout this investigation
281123 it has been an understandably difficult time for them dealing with the loss of a husband father and son and we are working hard to bring some closure for them
281124 it needs more lanes obviously because it is almost 30km long and it needs to be wider if it is going to take more traffic it is already jamming up as it is
281125 i think the problem is that cars dont appreciate the trucks
281126 because you have people like that who move in front of you by just three metres
281127 even worse if the truck is empty because it will jack knife really easily
281128 the newell great western and princes hwy are bad as well but they dont get all the rain and fog that we get here
281129 when some beet field person takes a few traces of this stuff he thinks he has just been elected president of mexico so he starts out to execute all his political enemies
281130 all mexicans are crazy and this stuff marijuana is what makes them crazy
281131 marihuana influences negroes to look at white people in the eye step on white mens shadows and look at a white woman twice
281132 under the influence of hashish those fanatics would madly rush at their enemies and ruthlessly massacre every one within their grasp

281165 to me what that place stands for is not modern day country music but where country music started where it came from

281167 i went off down to florida with my family and when i was driving back this came on the radio i dont listen to country radio but i had it on because i was tired i started thinking what a great singer he is every time he called me in to work with him the song was a hit

281171 until we hear from apple its hard to say what the real reason is because if it was at amp t well at amp t is not the iphone service provider outside the u s
281172 the iphone is not intended to be used as a tethering device and we have no plans to offer separate tethering plans for it
281173 we offer laptopconnect cards that you can use to access our wireless data network those cards offer typical download speeds as high as 1 7 mbps
281174 for customers looking for a smartphone with tethering capability we have many other options
281175 sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time
281176 were hoping well get some feedback from apple tomorrow at the very least i would hope apple will allow it in countries where the provider does permit tethering
281177 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
281178 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal
281179 we proactively engaged with them and tried to reach a positive conclusion for shareholders
281180 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts

281192 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well
281193 the commission affirmed that it can and will enforce an open internet and network neutrality principles
281194 n a pas une t te tre la copine de bernard tapie
281195 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
281196 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
281197 the horse has got a leg and a half between two holes in the floor its 8 feet underneath
281198 it basically was straddling this support beam its legs are dangling
281199 because it fell in the corner we had to take part of the stall wall apart
281200 somewhere along the line the vet showed up and gave it a sedative so it wouldnt hurt itself
281201 we pushed it up enough to get a plank under its butt
281202 nowdays theyve relocated their offices inside places where its harder to carry out public demonstrations because of all the private property issues
281203 its too bad that we have to do things like set up house on the avenue
281204 but we dont have any choice because our elected officials really dont care about these issues especially in the summer
281205 when it comes to who shows any interest in what were saying here it depends on who they are
281206 as a black man growing up on the southside i saw the guys on the corner making their money and having the cars and the stereos and the gold all the things that the tv says a young black man should have
281207 im 21 theres times that i wake up and just want to die
281208 the people i work with are more like family that my own family
281209 theyve shown me a different side of minneapolis that i never knew existed now i want to help others as well as myself
281210 i think the people on the street understand the issues better than those theyve elected to office
281211 we are asking people in minneapolis and st paul to come by our office and drop off their stories or join us at the minnesota truth commission our voices are important and need to be heard
281212 it will be theater goers going to a theater that isnt being a theater
281213 one of our goals for fringe fest is to show there are five rooms here
281214 there can be five groups of 20 if youd like or 100 there will be different crowds and moods
281215 we were inspired by the success of the nightcap series over the past couple years
281216 to us the lobby is as important as the theatre at the community level the fringe fest has 150 shows we are one central lobby celebrating theatre going people
281217 theres no other theater in town that gives you 2 to bike to a show and that has a bike shop with wi fi
281218 their bread reminds me of what my grandma would make
281219 thats supposed to go in a fringe fries bag for full effect
281220 now that thats done i feel ready for fringe central
281221 she is the one in our family who made the pierogis i just took them to the commercial level
281222 other fringe fests are more like the state fair people hop from one venue to the other because bedlam hosts so many shows there seems to be more socializing here maybe as a hub there will be more hanging out and socializing here during this years fringe
281223 at first we wanted to be a theatre venue now were excited to be the social center its fun thinking about the different crowds at different times of day
281224 we need to find a different place to practice our fringe theatre piece
281225 tripling our internet capacity when previously we could barely run our own in the office
281226 hashing out the vision for this with the fringe staff and bedlam staff has been like producing a play
281227 its a very creative process were making sure theater going is fun regardless of whether you like theater or not or the play youre seeing we thought if we had something to bring to the fringe it would be augmenting the theatre atmosphere
281228 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
281229 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
281230 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
281231 do any of them give any of their riches to charity
281232 they deserve the money fo you know how hard it is to keep fit
281233 the most extensive government reorganization of the american economy since the 1930s
281234 result will be trillions of new plants which inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen
281235 texans want ample generation supply access to lower electric prices and better air quality and txu will deliver all three
281236 the future growth of the now vibrant economy could be dampened by volatile and rising energy commodity prices there is no quick fix there is no easy solution to reduce u s dependence on foreign energy sources and to reduce power prices
281237 this is an important step in fulfilling txus commitment made in connection with the recently announced merger to immediately seek to suspend the permit application process for the eight units announced last year
281238 we want banks to shift their investments away from dirty and dangerous technologies and towards funding the future
281239 the last capitalist we hang shall be the one who sold us the rope
281240 that have come together to call on the federal government to quickly enact strong national legislation to require significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions
281241 delivering superior financial performance at the same time we improve the world
281242 calling for the federal government to enact national legislation to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
281243 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the us open you have no idea just to type those words hurt
281244 i think this will be the first grand slam i have ever missed
281245 it only seemed as though half of corporate america ground to a halt to attend starbucks was there of course in force but companies like chevron j c penney pfizer mcdonalds ford motor and exxon mobil all had representatives
281246 when done well csr builds business value in diverse ways by enhancing brand image establishing a more cooperative relationship with government regulatory agencies and garnering the interest of investors who are interested in issues related to sustainability
281247 if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
281248 help bp transcend the oil sector deliver top line growth and define the company as innovative progressive environmentally responsible
281249 that confronts such difficult issues as the conflict between energy and environmental needs and takes actions beyond what is expected of an oil company
281250 at its core csr expands the responsibility of business beyond its traditional definition of obeying the law and making a profit for its shareholders easily measured criterion to subjective goals like social benefits and environmental sustainability
281251 he believes that business shouldnt care about the negative effects of their core business practices they should only concern themselves with the bottom line
281252 the area around duluth is strikingly beautiful and were it not for the ill effects of industry in the area the town would have been a tourist mecca
281253 if the businesses in that area had given even the slightest thought to social responsiblity the property values in that area would be double or triple what they are today
281254 within 10 or 15 seconds deputies and marshals ran by
281255 they were running huffing and puffing as they went were not talking five or six deputies and marshals were talking about two dozen people
281256 he got extremely nervous and refused to stand still he turned around and ran and they went after him
281257 as they took him down the driveway ramp you would have thought a football team just scored a touchdown
281258 they were shaking hands patting each other on the back and two of them even hugged it was a big accomplishment to catch this one guy but it worried me with all these deputies gone from their posts to chase this one little old man who was watching the bad guys in the courthouse
281259 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
281260 because we see climate as a critical social issue and because we believe that greenhouse gases can be cost effectively reduced throughout the economy wal mart would accept a mandatory cap and trade system to control greenhouse gas emissions
281261 a responsible company would first investigate the claims about mans role in climate change and set a business course based on reality despite the prevailing notions of the liberal elite such an investigation would lead wal mart to recognize the unproven relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and global warming in this scenario wal mart would execute a completely different strategy lobby for a national policy encouraging domestic energy exploration
281262 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
281263 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
281264 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
281265 we applaud fords recognition of the environmental and safety problems posed by s
281266 awkward situation because its most profitable products do not meet its goals for social responsibility
281267 corporations should be and could be a major force for resolving environmental and social concerns in the 21st century
281268 governments tend not to solve problems only to rearrange them
281269 to call on the federal government to quickly enact strong national legislation to require significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions
281270 we were emitting a great deal of carbon dioxide between 1940 and 1975 but we were also generating a great deal of smog this smog like clouds blocked sunlight from reaching the earth of course smog is a bad thing and we had to get rid of it and we started doing so right around 1975 and once the full spectrum of sunlight was able to penetrate to the earth the carbon dioxide was able to take effect and drive our temperatures up
281271 ifp is the only organization that transcends all media and facilitates the artists business agent alignment ifp understands the critical intersection of talent money technique facilities and connections
281272 the right to remain creative inspiration creativity vision and passion all come before the bottom line
281273 robyne so totally gets ifp and foillard was unbelievable it was great seeing brad anderson having fun and chatting graciously with everyone and seeing kimberly elise again she is so elegant eloquent and a sweetheart it was just a great evening
281274 we have been informed that 16 students died and 27 were injured we think that there are still four or six more children under the rubble
281275 if better material was used it would at least not turn into rubble like this

281282 todays action by the fcc may actually result in slower online speeds for 95 percent of americas internet consumers
281283 although i have a tremendous amount of respect for each of my colleagues none of us has an engineering degree
281284 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
281285 if we arent going to stop a company that is looking inside its subscribers communications blocking communication when it uses a particular application regardless of whether there is congestion on the network hiding what it is doing by making consumers think the problem is their own and lying about it to the public what would we stop
281286 it makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and a handicap

281304 we can produce energy and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions just by looking at resources we already have
281305 so what we could do is take this manure which right now is an environmental liability and turn it into a commodity
281306 this is very appealing for agricultural operations its feasible its been done in other countries we could do it here

281313 if we allow the government to restrict our access to tools because we might hurt someone we become in a very real sense children or peasants dependent on the elites to know whats best for us
281314 about half of the time gun stock increases have been accompanied by violence decreases and about half the time accompanied by violence increases just what one would expect if gun levels had no net impact on violence rates the rate of gun suicide is correlated with trends in the size of the gun or handgun stock but the rate of total suicide is not supporting a substitution argument when guns are scarce suicide attempters substitute other methods with no effect on the total number who die trends in the size of the cumulated gun or handgun stock have no consistent correlation with crime rates
281315 may i refer you to my point about that the only reason the robber has a gun is becuase they know your armed to the teeth
281316 there are plenty of countries that have strictly controlled guns and not descended into martial law and chaos
281317 it is only proper to kill in self defense when you have totally exhausted every other possibility
281318 oh noes wild west shoot outs at the super market drive bys on the interstate death destruction mass hysteria
281319 handguns are specifically mentioned as an unbannable arm also handguns are better for self defense because you can use a phone with your off hand not as easy to do that with a shotgun also handguns have less penetration then long arms so there is less chance of a bullet going through a wall and hitting something you didnt intend to hit
281320 it is only proper to kill in self defense when you have totally exhausted every other possibility
281321 maybe instead of focusing on which tool they decide to use we should be concentrating on what we can do to turn young men from predatory violence and towards protective
281322 i support some restrictions and dont think they would be unconstitutional
281323 the plain fact is that there are many free countries where guns are controlled and people live happily and safely
281324 america must do a cost benefit analysis how many lives for uncontrolled guns how many deaths a year
281325 since 1945 the handgun per capita rate has risen by over 350 and over 260 for all firearms
281326 i support some restrictions and dont think they would be unconstitutional
281327 remember why we never ever ever let the government take away our firearms because the only reason to take them from law abiding people is so that they can then round up and shoot the now unarmed people without getting shot themselves
281328 and yes im set in my ways of not wanting to kill another human being if at all possible and it seems to me pro gun people dont seem interested in alternatives from what ive seen here

281359 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations

281370 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism
281371 the use of the military in opposing drug smuggling and illegal immigration was a significant step away from the acts central tenet that there was no proper role for the military in the direct enforcement of the laws

281375 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead we are talking about attacks like the sub prime mortgage that was a phenomenon that started in the african american and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell and the jena six and on and on in the face of all these attacks why is it that you have not one time had the ability to speak to the interest and the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african american community in this country

281386 cremation is now permitted it does not enjoy the same value as burial of the body the church clearly prefers and urges that the body of the deceased be present for the funeral rites since the presence of the human body better expresses the values which the church affirms in its rites
281387 when extraordinary circumstances make the cremation of a body the only feasible choice pastoral sensitivity must be exercised by all who minister to the family of the deceased
281388 the cremated remains of a body should be treated with the same respect given to the corporeal remains of a human body this includes the use of a worthy vessel to contain the ashes the manner in which they are carried the care and attention to appropriate placement and transport and the final disposition
281389 the practice of scattering cremated remains on the sea from the air or on the ground or keeping cremated remains in the home of a relative or friend of the deceased are not the reverent disposition that the church requires
281390 the practice of burying the bodies of the faithful is by all means to be kept
281391 the church earnestly recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the dead be observed it does not however forbid cremation unless it has been chosen for reasons which are contrary to christian teaching

281400 a little too busy to deal with two things at once
281401 car 54 where are you there is a robbery in progress outside the don jail
281402 you know that i think is an indication that they dont have many good ideas in terms of actually solving problems for the american people
281403 and my goal is to keep talking about the issues that matter
281404 if you continue to see an economic slide that is going to cost far more in terms of tax revenues because businesses arent selling taxes arent being collected
281405 and what were going to end up with is a much worse situation
281406 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
281407 this notion that somehow i was playing the race card is ridiculous
281408 what i said in front of a 98 conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
281409 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to what presidential candidates typically look like
281410 it doesnt just have to do with race it has to do with my name it has to do with my biography and my background it has to do with our message of change
281411 in no ways do i think the mccain campaign has targeted race issues although i will say the way they have amplified this is has been troublesome and the eagerness in which theyve done it they think they can exploit this politically in fact what i have said and theres no doubt about this is that they want me to appear risky to the american people and i dont think that there is any doubt that people are still trying to figure out whats this young guy doing here running for president
281412 our job is to make sure that the changes were promoting is the changes that have to be made if we dont make them in fact thats the riskier course
281413 i think his comments were clearly were clearly the race card because of what he said everybody can read his remarks and in fact his campaign retracted those remarks so i think its very clear and i was very disappointed i was very disappointed at his comments so his campaign retracted those remarks so lets move on
281414 is this the best you could come up with is this what the american people deserve
281415 youll hear from my opponent sen obama tomorrow and if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
281416 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
281417 i think the united states of america has reached a point where we should provide equal economic opportunities for all americans and i do not and americans have rejected a quota system and that frankly is something that i dont think helps anyone and has not helped anyone but i want to assure that i dont believe that any of these initiatives that were talking about in any way eliminates our abilities to assist small businesses the economic disadvantaged and others
281418 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
281419 so im not exactly sure which budgetary aspects youre talking about but one of the things that has been of enormous help is the tremendous charity and generosity of people all over america not necessarily from new york city that have contributed tens of millions of dollars to make possible this transition that the new york city school system is going through
281420 i am extremely disgusted with mccain he said that he would not run a negative campaign now he has stooped to bush rove basement level lows
281421 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
281422 he used todays forum to announce his support for the education equality project an education opportunity advocacy program that mccain noted was supported by both al sharpton and jc watts
281423 it was a communication to our supporters and it was kind of a bookend to a week that we thought was very successful and it was the intention to use a little bit of humor
281424 as the underdog campaign sometimes our crowds arent 200 000 strong and roaring but that its just a different approach and style and imagery and were holding our own were very pleased with the way things are going and where we are
281425 how does he like the mccain camp mocking him as the one
281426 the one as mccain aides sardonically call obama glided through afghanistan iraq and jordan girding his messianic loins for the inevitable kvetching he would face in israel as skeptical jews try to get a better sense of whats in obamas kishkes
281427 i dont know that people in missouri are going to like seeing tens of thousands of europeans screaming for the one a mccain aide snarked to the politico
281428 it was a communication to our supporters and it was kind of a bookend to a week that we thought was very successful and it was the intention to use a little bit of humor wallace said
281429 as the underdog campaign sometimes our crowds arent 200 000 strong and roaring sometimes lol but that its just a different approach and style and imagery and were holding our own were very pleased with the way things are going and where we are

281433 we actually got approached about doing it by multiple people

281439 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
281440 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
281441 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
281442 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
281443 rates of infection among african americans and also among hispanics are much higher than among white women sixty four percent of women with hiv are black even though blacks only make up about 13 percent of the u s population
281444 education plays an important role because hiv is more prevalent in their communities women of color need to know they are more likely to be exposed to hiv
281445 all women should understand how to protect themselves such as limiting their number of partners and using condoms consistently
281446 physicians can explain to their patients that hiv screening is recommended for all adults now and that there are numerous benefits to being tested we need to continue to destigmatize hiv screening and make it a part of routine care
281447 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
281448 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
281449 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
281450 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
281451 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
281452 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
281453 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
281454 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
281455 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for rest of the world
281456 this is an important day for india and for our civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
281457 this important issue will welcome india into the nonproliferation mainstream and assist india in meeting its growing energy needs in an environmentally friendly way
281458 todays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds nonproliferation regime
281459 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create precedence and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapon activities
281460 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with the anthrax investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
281461 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
281462 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
281463 we anticipate being able to provide additional details in the near future
281464 the public the victims families and law enforcement would like to know that the book is closed on this investigation
281465 the fbi has not briefed me about todays news reports so i cannot say whether that is the case
281466 what we learn will not change the fact that this has been a poorly handled investigation that has lasted six years and already has resulted in a trail of embarrassment and personal tragedy
281467 its been frustrating that the fbi has essentially shut out congress throughout its seven year investigation now seems to be the opportune time for the bureau to brief congress about whether the case is to be closed and justice will be served
281468 if it is we must thoroughly examine the reasons why in the meantime we should remember that a rush to judgment can be dangerous and expensive for everyone the last person the fbi had in its sights in this case suffered for six years and just collected a 6 million settlement
281469 they were involved in an altercation at the airport in the departure lounge

281474 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
281475 extraordinarily atypical because not many people have a laptop and are homeless
281476 in 1999 when the mission rock shelter closed a comprehensive survey was done and a surprisingly high number as high as 20 percent were employed
281477 absolutely there are cases where people are working and simply are not earning enough to live in a high cost area like san francisco
281478 if you are not on a subsidy it is very very difficult to get housing on your own
281479 look i make between 2 000 and 3 000 a month it costs between 1 600 and 1 800 for a motel at 50 60 a night for a cheap one in a suburb like fremont you can do that but youre not saving anything to get out of this
281480 every time i try that i end up between a crackhead and some drunk
281481 i am in after dark and back out before dawn i do no drinking make no noise and always leave it cleaner than when i went in
281482 starbucks are the best because you can go in there alone and lock the door
281483 right now i have the best of abbott and costello and it came from outer space
281484 vamos a formar a los universitarios haciendo lo que llamamos sombras de trabajo es decir que haya gente que entienda c mo se hace el trabajo aunque no f sicamente lo est ejecutando pero nuestra expectativa es crear demanda adicional para que los estudiantes hagan trabajo productivo
281485 hay una cantidad de egresados con perfiles de este tipo en asia tanto en china como en la india sin embargo los servicios remotos que se ofrecen a estados unidos han venido de m s a menos porque el servicio desde la india no ha sido tan bueno y m xico es un reciente descubrimiento positivo hay una perspectiva de que hay profesionistas hay talento
281486 con la firma del acuerdo buscamos captar el mejor talento en la medida en que lo encontremos podremos decir que somos mejor que la competencia podemos ampliar la oferta de servicios de valor agregado pero a un costo menor
281487 los estudiantes ya no tienen que egresar y buscar otro nivel de capacitaci n lo obtienen durante su carrera
281488 vamos a cumplir con explorar nuevos caminos en el proceso de formar estudiantes competentes para unirse al mercado laboral
281489 wpp announces that the offer document containing the formal offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of tns is being posted today
281490 gfk is continuing to actively pursue an all cash offer for tns and discussions in relation to this possible offer are progressing positively

281495 orlando fla john mccain the father of private school students criticized democratic rival barack obama on friday for choosing private over public school for his kids the difference according to the arizona republican is that he not obama favors vouchers that give parents more school choices
281496 my kids have all been in private schools but if my opponent chooses to do the same that makes him wrong
281497 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
281498 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
281499 so i think it s pretty obvious that at least they acknowledged that
281500 its next to two architectural icons camden station and oriole park
281501 i think about how dangerous it can be now how more people could be hurt even though i dont do anything when im down there
281502 i dont go down there to hurt anybody i just go down there because i still love the system
281503 i hate it when they tear down old buildings just because they are old i think we really need to save our history and this is a good beginning here
281504 so they thought this is to important of an issue we want you to have the opportunity to tell us at the very beginning this is what we want you to do with the money
281505 this certainly makes me want to reanalyze the whole idea of should we be buying the water company or not to get that in the citys control im a firm believer that if was in the citys control we can keep the rate of the increases to a nominal amount
281506 i was not a proponent of buying the water company not a proponent of buying it today
281507 i think its too expensive and i dont see where the citizens want the government taking over the private sector
281508 even if it was 220 million now i think certainly the benefits of municipal owned water company makes a lot of sense
281509 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics

281553 american intelligence agencies have concluded that members of pakistans powerful spy service helped plan the deadly july 7 bombing of indias embassy in kabul afghanistan according to united states government officials the conclusion was based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack the officials said providing the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region the american officials also said there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas concerns about the role played by pakistani intelligence not only has strained relations between the united states and pakistan a longtime ally but also has fanned tensions between pakistan and its archrival india within days of the bombings indian officials accused the directorate of inter services intelligence or isi of helping to orchestrate the attack in kabul which killed 54 including an indian defense attach this week pakistani troops clashed with indian forces in the contested region of kashmir threatening to fray an uneasy cease fire that has held since november 2003 the new york times reported this week that a top central intelligence agency official traveled to pakistan this month to confront senior pakistani officials with information about support provided by members of the isi to militant groups it had not been known that american intelligence agencies concluded that elements of pakistani intelligence provided direct support for the attack in kabul
281554 a top central intelligence agency official traveled secretly to islamabad this month to confront pakistans most senior officials with new information about ties between the countrys powerful spy service and militants operating in pakistans tribal areas according to american military and intelligence officials the c i a emissary presented evidence showing that members of the spy service had deepened their ties with some militant groups that were responsible for a surge of violence in afghanistan possibly including the suicide bombing this month of the indian embassy in kabul the officials said the decision to confront pakistan with what the officials described as a new c i a assessment of the spy services activities seemed to be the bluntest american warning to pakistan since shortly after the sept 11 attacks about the ties between the spy service and islamic militants the c i a assessment specifically points to links between members of the spy service the directorate for inter services intelligence or isi and the militant network led by maulavi jalaluddin haqqani which american officials believe maintains close ties to senior figures of al qaeda in pakistans tribal areas the c i a has depended heavily on the isi for information about militants in pakistan despite longstanding concerns about divided loyalties within the pakistani spy service which had close relations with the taliban in afghanistan before the sept 11 attacks that isi officers have maintained important ties to anti american militants has been the subject of previous reports in the new york times but the c i a and the bush administration have generally sought to avoid criticism of pakistan which they regard as a crucial ally in the fight against terrorism the visit to pakistan by the c i a official stephen r kappes the agencys deputy director was described by several american military and intelligence officials in interviews in recent days some of those who were interviewed made clear that they welcomed the decision by the c i a to take a harder line toward the isis dealings with militant groups
281555 within days of the bombings indian officials accused the directorate of inter services intelligence or isi of helping to orchestrate the attack in kabul which killed 54 including an indian defense attach
281556 this week pakistani troops clashed with indian forces in the contested region of kashmir threatening to fray an uneasy cease fire that has held since november 2003
281557 india said on friday that peace talks with pakistan were at the lowest point in their four year history after a spate of bombings in indian cities and at the countrys embassy in kabul
281558 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
281559 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
281560 the governors of the u n nuclear watchdog approved an inspections plan for india on friday an important step towards completing a nuclear cooperation deal between new delhi and the united states the plan approved by consensus by the international atomic energy agencys board of governors will permit regular iaea surveillance of indias declared civilian nuclear energy plants 14 of 22 existing or planned reactors this clears a hurdle to an accord that would allow sales of atomic materials and technology for civilian use to india the deal has been criticized because new delhi has not signed the global non proliferation treaty npt

281597 my major knowledge comes from what i call the old timers people who were at roswell and subsequent who wanted to clear the things up and tell somebody credible even though they were under severe threats and things this was back in the roswell days having gone to the moon and being a local citizen out in the roswell area some of them thought i would be a safe choice to tell their story to which they did even though the government put real clamps on everybody it got out anyhow
281598 three humongous craft flew over phoenix very slowly in the middle of the night that clearly were not i happened to be on the phone with people out there when that happened and have had pictures of it clearly those were not to those of us who know aviation and spacecraft clearly those were not local stuff home grown stuff
281599 for many years i have lived with a secret in a secrecy imposed on all specialists and astronauts i can now reveal that every day in the usa our radar instruments capture objects of form and composition unknown to us
281600 i happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that weve been visited on this planet and the ufo phenomena is real
281601 its been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so but slowly its leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it
281602 ive been in military and intelligence circles who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge yes we have been visited reading the papers recently its been happening quite a bit
281603 this is really starting to open up i think were headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction
281604 i thought id stumbled on some sort of astronaut humour but he was absolutely serious that aliens are definitely out there and theres no debating it
281605 the israeli interior ministry say i have a lebanese passport
281606 apparently they think im planning to smuggle more palestinians into the country
281607 my male lead salah bakri is a 48 palestinian and so wasnt allowed to be in ramallah we had the same problem with my production manager and some other crew including the europeans like my
281608 we had about 80 locations around ramallah jerusalem and jaffa
281609 we were denied permission to shoot a very important scene at
281610 all the gear for the shoot was in the back of my production managers beat up old pick up truck a silver mitsubishi that old truck got shipped to marseilles because it was cheaper than renting a vehicle in france he left it there
281611 theres a key aerial shot we needed from a helicopter approaching jaffa from the sea since im a security risk the israelis wouldnt give me permission to be in the helicopter for the shot so my camera operator had to shoot it alone
281612 we had plenty of police visiting the set and harassing salah
281613 im not sure but i think this is the only film shot inside israel without israeli line producers when i told my friends i planned to shoot in palestine they told me it would be impossible i told them wed show them it could be done and we did
281614 the way people supported us when they found out what the film was about
281615 was really amazing so many people went out of their way to help us bringing us food and water we had extra production assistants everywhere we went
281616 a lot of our people were working on their first film a jewelry maker a dj kaza at the beginning of the process they had no experience making films but since we wrapped up the shoot theyve kept working there have been three features and seven or eight shorts shot around ramallah
281617 the films about her going to palestine and falling into life among the elite there when she meets this guy from amari camp she finds she cant relate to him at all but they connect
281618 its such a great honor to be premiered there especially with this year being the anniversary of the nakba
281619 but the film was such a labor of love for us and the people who helped us in the camp that it seemed more important to share that pleasure with them prestigious as cannes is theres a sense that this film is for us
281620 their professionalism was something i learned from over the past couple years its something a lot of people will have to carry on
281621 were not going to rush i know now hes very excited his brothers here

281625 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
281626 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
281627 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
281628 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
281629 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
281630 though the decline wasnt huge it was very broadly based with only health care and mining showing anything that could be described as strength hours worked per week declined which is a bad sign for future hiring
281631 if we look at the job losses we had during the time people are calling a mild recession which was 2001 we were losing about 180 000 jobs a month at that time so clearly this is a different degree
281632 we dont like to see job losses obviously 51 000 is disappointing
281633 what were seeing is a mild recession interrupted here by a rebate program
281634 once they consumers finish spending these checks well head down again
281635 a sign of how troubled our economy is that some analysts are greeting the seventh straight month of job losses and an increase in the unemployment rate to 5 7 percent as relatively good news
281636 this stimulus should include increases in the federal share of medicaid significantly increase funding for home energy assistance and food stamps and other measures which will provide badly needed stimulus for our economy and help state and local governments and individuals improve the quality of their lives
281637 the fed is stuck on hold trapped between a weak economy on one side and high headline inflation on the other
281638 what could rescue us is oil prices getting back down under 100
281639 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
281640 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
281641 we are fully on track to be complete with the cost reduction
281642 everyday you see these horses theyre almost starving to death you see their rib bones their back bones their tale bones they walk around they look pitiful
281643 the horses are ultimately suffering for it theyre literally dying over there
281644 they dont feed the horses theyve gone all winter long without being fed maybe a couple of bails of hay here and there just neglect real bad neglect
281645 ive seen the sheriff over there two or three times telling them to feed the horses theyll feed them for about a week then thats it its back to the same situation
281646 im not sure if its truly mistreatment or they dont have the means to take care of the animals and if thats the case they at to at least give them to somebody
281647 com passa el temps sembla estrany per sino fos que ja tinc tants anys

281649 we all are going to get old and we will go the same way
281650 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
281651 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
281652 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
281653 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
281654 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
281655 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
281656 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
281657 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
281658 thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
281659 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative city and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
281660 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
281661 what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
281662 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
281663 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
281664 youll hear from my opponent sen obama tomorrow and if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
281665 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
281666 i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics
281667 this wasnt injecting race at all thats not the issue here at all and i dont understand why they seem to try to make something out of a thing that took place months ago
281668 he said it out in mississippi before an all white audience and nobody saw it as injecting race and so i think its a shame that a man that ive always considered to be very honorable seems to be running such a dishonorable campaign
281669 obama was anticipating you know that race will be an issue although john mccain has worked very very diligently to make sure that race is not the issue
281670 well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
281671 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
281672 whats happened is that sen mccain has made a decision that hes going to run 100 percent negative ads and you know why because hes trying to defend policies that are indefensible in our economy foreign policy
281673 this is not the john mccain that we expected in this campaign this is not the john mccain who ran in 2000
281674 barack obama never called john mccain a racist and in fact you know the quote that ricks referring to happened at a town hall meeting in a rural area of missouri not one newspaper reported it the way he accounts for it
281675 and now we see sen mccain saying hes proud of his britney spears paris hilton ad and its really a shame i think the country expected more
281676 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
281677 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
281678 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
281679 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
281680 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
281681 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
281682 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
281683 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
281684 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
281685 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
281686 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
281687 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
281688 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
281689 although this democrat majority just adjourned for the democrat 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor
281690 this covenant is a badly needed mechanism for solving our problems
281691 we wont be dealing with consequences of any action were just dealing with the framework
281692 autonomy and self rule and so provinces will guard that jealously
281693 a large block of african provinces including the global south
281694 should be one of friendship of mutual respect co operation
281695 were not in a hurry the devil is in a hurry
281696 it is clear that provinces were heard concerns about confessionalism were allayed there were serious efforts to address the central role of worship and prayer in holding us together
281697 almost all the canadian concerns were addressed in this draft
281698 we believe that it has taken into account concerns expressed about the role of the primates meeting and provides a much clearer recognition of the role of laity and of the synodical decision making processes in dioceses and provinces throughout the communion
281699 there was a distinct change in tone in the language of the appendix and that while the tentative and provisional nature of the procedures outlined in the appendix is highlighted in both the communiqu and the commentary its presence as the only possible option for conflict resolution gives it greater significance than we believe is either intended or warranted
281700 two of the pubs near oxford which c s lewis frequented were the trout and the six bells some of lewiss american readers had written him to inquire about his views on drinking alcoholic beverages his response to them was in no uncertain terms i have always in my books been concerned simply to put forward mere christianity and am no guide on these most regrettable interdenominational questions i do however most strongly object to the tyrannic and unscriptural insolence of anything that calls itself a church and makes teetotalism a condition of membership apart from the more serious objection that our lord himself turned water into wine and made wine the medium of the only rite he imposed on all his followers it is so provincial what i believe you people call small town dont they realize that christianity arose in the mediterranean world where then as now wine was as much a part of the normal diet as bread

281725 when youre out in the boonies doing all the hard work and everything its nice to know youre appreciated so were making an effort to try and convey that message to one soldier and maybe other soldiers will hear that message that theyre appreciated
281726 the plane we came off originally when we got back there were a lot of veterans to greet us but its different when were coming home to our hometown because no one is there so it makes it a lot better when strangers come out and greet you
281727 i didnt sleep i tried to work a lot to keep my mind occupied
281728 it was real special they called me and told me they were going to do that my daughter got a hummer limousine waiting upstairs to ride home in style
281729 i got a whole new grasp on life now that i joined the army i appreciate things a lot more
281730 today were flooded with information its an information overload and were not capable of handling it
281731 this would relieve us from the anxiousness or need to try to remember everything and theres the issue of trouble with recollection its like your index is broken you know you know something but you cant get there this could help people having trouble with their memory reconstruct their memories
281732 after you take the pictures you place them in the system
281733 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
281734 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously
281735 due to circumstances beyond my control i regret that i will not be able to participate in black hat this year
281736 we are concerned that it might play out that they have fewer choices
281737 a thousand dollars a month raises a lot of eyebrows
281738 if it was your home bill you would look into it no matter how affluent you are
281739 we started paying attention to the top talkers and their bills are difficult to justify
281740 if the starting point is entirely unmanaged and the new state is tightly controlled
281741 there was never a deal put on the table that was compelling enough that we as the board could look the shareholders in the eyes and say this is a good deal for you
281742 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
281743 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
281744 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
281745 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
281746 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest
281747 he is as some would say a good guy despite the bad things written about him we look forward to him being a productive member of the board
281748 they are so humble a hard working family one of the american dreams
281749 el sistema educativo en castilla la mancha repite otro gran impulso cuantitativo y cualitativo que nos sit a en los primeros puestos del estado tanto en profesorado como en plantillas como en las distintas ofertas educativas para afrontar con xito los retos de calidad

281756 those are your top 10 movies joking right if serious makes me wonder if you have ever seen any great movies
281757 the recently revealed lawsuit that was sheepishly leaked to the press by troyers attorney is an abomination of the legal process
281758 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
281759 he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much you know displayed it to us like that and then dropped it on the ground in front of us
281760 all truth passes through three stages first it is ridiculed second it is violently opposed third it is accepted as being self evident
281761 a week later he said why didnt they tell me it would be like this
281762 if you can get people to experience the benefits of the changed situation they will turn around and embrace it
281763 one thing change leaders must be able to do is to let go of what they worked so hard to achieve when something better comes along
281764 which lets people decide who they who they want to live with not just be stuffed into a slot that happens to become available
281765 got a few of these people to recognize the value and now they have become some of the most enthusiastic proponents
281766 you have to accept that a certain percentage of the old guard will fight to retain the status quo human tendency is to fear the risks you dont know and ignore the risks you do know but you build on the new people coming in once theyre in the majority the change will become the accepted practice
281767 talking talking talking until we move people from what are you crazy
281768 even though they are illegal they still have homes and jobs
281769 it will have an impact on our economy because we dont necessarily have the people to back fill these jobs and the other people we do have might not want to do it
281770 we dont want to pay the cost but we do want affordable labor
281771 fix it or nix it can you save it from the landfill
281772 when you pick up a 2 8 human being and throw him to the floor it hurts
281773 in the lawsuit troyer basically says shrider terrorized him once picked the lock to his bedroom door pushing away a 100 pound scooter that was used to block the door and then throwing him to the floor
281774 during the exercises the crews will practice simulated bomber runs at testing grounds in the novgorod and the saratov regions

281795 someone fatally hurt my baby brother and i wasnt there to protect him
281796 it hurts me to know he was in pain and no one was there to help him
281797 lamar wasnt armed he wasnt trying to harm or hurt mr martin
281798 etienne martin was prepared to arm himself with a knife and if necessary stab the victim
281799 he acted with a certain coolness of thought afterwards in trying to dispose of the evidence
281800 and he did a good job of it police never located the evidence
281801 mr martin would not be a likely candidate to re offend
281802 in fact he can be a contributing member of society
281803 ive been told as the days go by it will get easier
281804 but i havent experienced that it has gotten even harder to deal with the way my son was brutally murdered
281805 i feel like i am living in hell since my sons death
281806 i just assumed martin stabbed him because philip grabbed the side of his body i just remember philip screaming and grabbing the left side of his body he had a hole in his shirt
281807 brain death could not think my way out of a paper bag
281808 give me a smile sweetie why do you always look so down
281809 hey i was just wondering if you had a few moments as i was curious as to what has sparked the notes in the kitchen as of late
281810 well its just that other people tend to leave dishes in the sink and that makes the kitchen messy im assuming because youre here now thats you guys
281811 i understand how that may bother you however i hardly think three items in the sink from this morning hardly warrants a snarky note i mean i literally walked through the door 20 minutes ago i have been gone for 14 hours and i would hope you would be able to realize that we are currently juggling moving with my starting a new job this week with trying to pack and when it comes down to it the simple fact is its only 3 dishes and your note pisses me off
281812 dishes dont belong in the sink it prevents us from doing our dishes
281813 on a number of occations chris i have done not only my dishes but yours as well and still cleaned the kitchen afterwards its the sink after all and its where unwashed dishes belong
281814 not only that but the note is unesissary you shouldnt feel like you cant come to us when you have a problem with something we are doing
281815 i shouldnt have to come to you and be like i need you to do your dishes
281816 youre missing the point i havent been home to do the three dishes i left in the sink this morning chris i simply havent been home
281817 well my point is no one youre going to live with in a shared house is perfect but we are trying our best here and
281818 oh i know no one is going to be perfect
281819 well you know what chris youre not perfect either in fact i was late to work twice last week because you and your little girlfriend decided to screw in the shower while i was trying
281820 well maybe not but from what i could hear from halfway down the stairs was that there was giggling bumping and slight moaning involved and im sure i dont need to explain to you what walks like a duck and all that jazz the point is your morning frollicks in the bathroom prevented me from leaving on time twice because i had to wait until you were finished to grab my tampons out of the bathroom and do you know what i had enough fucking respect to not leave an embarrassing snarky note about it in the kitchen and thats what i am asking of you respect motherfucker
281821 i was just sitting there in the news conference listening to kenny williams
281822 all of a sudden he says im excited to introduce our new center fielder ken griffey jr i dont quite understand it but as soon as he said the word centerfielder my hamstring popped
281823 we certainly were not expecting this we felt like he could be a valuable contribution to our team but we did not realize that even the mention of the word centerfield would result in a serious injury to him
281824 yeah if we make it to the playoffs then ill be ready to suit up and play
281825 gosh i just hope we make it i told kenny williams that he should try and get some outfield help just in case you know we may need another solid bat in the outfield to hold off the twins
281826 its called a pine cone and it comes from the good earth
281827 i dont see how you can talk about food at a time like this
281828 another ideal moment for insights according to the scientists is the early morning right after we wake up
281829 its not that youre running around frightened down to your last bullet in
281830 it should be much more of you winning because that was always the point in doom you are the hero and you are winning youre going to beat back all the hordes of hell using all the tools at your disposal
281831 the next doom game will look like its built on another engine as it uses three times the horsepower of rage
281832 in this age of obsessive video sharing and social networking nearly every action is designed and packaged for public consumption especially with young people
281833 the immed iate charm of nick and his crew is that theyre the exact opposite of all that there is nothing calculated or self conscious about who they are theyre just a group of friends doing some thing to challenge themselves and have some laughs its a story which would have never come from kids who were born here
281834 esto es una sola adquisici n hasta donde conocemos no hay otros bancos en venta

281837 its certainly one of the more recognizable i guess you could say the ascent the roebling bridge and the mike fink are the three icons covington has now
281838 its all below the water line but when you walk on it youll notice an immediate difference
281839 if the earth is touching the building the earth wins and the county would have no choice but to order people out
281840 its pushing up against my deck its turning the deck sideways
281841 right now the concern is if it pushes hard enough ill have to take the deck down
281842 we are working on finalizing the details for a resolution to the unfortunate situation at mariemont promenade it is more complicated than we originally anticipated we hope to finalize an agreement within a few weeks we greatly appreciate everyones patience during this challenging time

281846 manny being manny is widely acknowledged to be an additional factor for the sluggers release
281847 its the same thing as boston and joe torre thinks he the boss of me
281848 on the phone i was like hey manny great to have you with us were deep in a division race so well need to get you out on the field as soon as possible so i really may have overdone it a bit
281849 what is this im done with that fielding thing man im a dh now straight up
281850 no dh are you kidding me right now what is this little league thats garbage its like the 20th century man but whatever just another reason why i dont want to be here and whats the rush anyway youre in a division race big deal youll still be a game or two out in two or three weeks right
281851 maybe we are all in too big of a rush maybe if we just slow things down good things will happen im gonna call manny and tell him that he can report whenever he wants
281852 there are some places in this country where they know how to respect players unfortunately l a does not seem to be one of them maybe they can trade me to boston though i have very fond memories of my time there

281929 this is the type of thing that reeks of kids out there with too much time on their hands and getting into trouble that doesnt make it any less serious
281930 its upsetting its a little bit scary to know that people like that are out there

281940 the virtues and vices of our millian constitution the supreme courts repudiation of immorality as a ground of criminal punishment
281941 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
281942 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
281943 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
281944 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
281945 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

281960 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
281961 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
281962 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
281963 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority

281969 at every single event we had at least one military member doing volunteer duty and you could tell they were tickled to death to do it
281970 the military has really stepped up to the plate just like the rest of the community to ensure the games proceed smoothly and that the athletes are taken care of we couldnt have put on these games without them
281971 im honored to be here and to be able to meet these amazing athletes
281972 seeing what theyre able to do makes everything about this amazing
281973 its amazing to see how much they put into this and how much heart they have in it
281974 its really inspiring to see how motivated they are to come and win these and then to see the big smiles when they wear those medals
281975 all of these athletes are veterans so its sort of like we are helping our own
281976 the veterans appreciate it when they see us in uniform knowing that we support them
281977 and its gratifying for us too seeing the competitors smiling and so happy to be out there
281978 you see them get outside and do things they never thought they could do
281979 i could be one of these people and i would want to know that someone was there to support me
281980 theyre all veterans they have done more than their part for the country and they deserve whatever we can do for them
281981 as a nurse i see them in the hospital and i dont know what happens to them afterward
281982 here im getting to see them not just function but function at a very high level thats pretty gratifying
281983 you can see it in their eyes they associate with you and relate with you
281984 they focus on you because you are wearing the uniform and its clear that they are very grateful for what we are doing
281985 tolerate the worldly unbearable things with a large belly laugh at any ridiculous mortal with the open mouth
281986 gay couples cant have biological kids together so if homosexuality is genetic why hasnt it died out
281987 getting these oral histories now is important because once they are gone their stories are gone forever
281988 this is first generation knowledge stories from the heroes who performed these missions told in their purest form
281989 i love getting these guys they have such great stories and none of them are boring
281990 you get so much out of these interviews you hear them talk and read their body language and get their emotion its pretty powerful
281991 ive had guys get tears in their eyes and tell me that this is the first time theyve shared their stories
281992 i had one vietnam veteran tell me i feel so much better
281993 all of them love their country and are here for all the right reasons
281994 the patriotism you see in these people is just phenomenal
281995 this is a balancing act and we work with multiple agencies to determine what type of support they need from us
281996 downsizing typically occurs when our partner agencies believe they can manage the fires still burning with the civilian air and ground assets they have available
281997 we have six aircraft still supporting active missions but well have about four additional aircraft available that will serve as alert aircraft able to launch if needed
281998 the out of state units showed up and were eager to help out with the mission so were sending them out
281999 this is a great opportunity for us and them since they are getting some hands on experience fighting the fires helping out california and also giving our aircrews a chance to breathe
282000 we got here july 16 and completed our training so now were ready to get out there and help
282001 we almost got to launch twice yesterday but firefighters in the area were able to gain control of the situation quickly
282002 its been remarkable to take so many aircraft from different states bring them to california and train and utilize them
282003 this is a first an historic event and weve built a template showing that allegiances like this are critical i think from this we can actually work toward a national standard for emergency response

282016 thats one of the things that we want to try and address the game is a first person action game that has a variety of gameplay that is no longer just run and gun it focuses on story driven missions its not this huge mindless open world but it is a first person action game that has a variety of gameplay built upon id tech 5 thats really our key message
282017 we are working on what the story is going to be for the game right now the logo shown during quakecon didnt have a four or a subtitle we havent made the decision about that yet there is probably a lets not make a numeral game and some say we should make it one

282033 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
282034 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
282035 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
282036 the first stars were very different from stars like the sun
282037 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
282038 we do see stars in our galaxy that have very different properties than our sun and its possible these are second generation stars
282039 abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe
282040 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point toward our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
282041 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star
282042 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous

282046 100 percent committed to helping become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters
282047 they will be made collaboratively with senator clinton and her staff the dnc and senator obamas campaign
282048 its not true she wants her name to be placed in nomination but she cant actively ask for delegates to do it because she has suspended her campaign and that would be campaigning but we can make sure the petition is in place for her to sign if and when she needs to or wants to at the convention
282049 so she has every reason to believe that theyll start beating that drum again
282050 unless and until she says i am releasing my delegates
282051 the book i refer to most often is probably my own i wrote it partly so i wouldnt have to remember all the stuff ive learned over the years
282052 theres been a copy in the family country home for as long as i can remember stained with every summer fruit available in the northeast
282053 she has some amazing things scattered throughout every book and i always learn something
282054 not as much for the recipes but as a way to think about food theyre anachronistic and that plays really well with all my romantic and escapist fantasies
282055 im not such a cookbook person not at all there was a moment before i began baking 20 years ago that i was a certified cookbook fiend i read them morning noon and night
282056 as you probably have guessed i dont get stains on books but i do get the metaphor
282057 were it in a restaurant kitchen it would almost certainly bring on a raid by the health department
282058 the most stained tattered dog eared and well loved cookbook i own
282059 looking through the pictures in that book convinced me to be a chef
282060 i dont quite have a stained cookbook but i have a go to one that is a constant source of information and passion
282061 these were the books i thumbed through read and reread and cooked my way through either at home or work
282062 the book thats used in culinary school here in france and holds the basic techniques of french cuisine
282063 we must have cooked nearly every recipe nearly 10 times each over the past 20 years i adore her pear clafoutis which my wife loves to make
282064 it was a 22nd birthday gift from my college roommate and beyond being stained it has lost its hard cover
282065 in the bayless house breakfast is the meal that they all eat together
282066 i bought my first copy 15 years ago and discovered many of my grandmothers and mothers recipes corrected refined and perfected though marcellas exquisite bolognese sauce is beyond anything that nanna rose could conceive of
282067 she was writing about great simple ingredients and mediterranean foods when i first started cooking back in the last 70s
282068 it is one of the smallest yet most useful books a g p s of cooking
282069 one time when i worked at campanile i brought it in and nancy silverton said wow i hope someday i see a copy of my book that looks like that
282070 i learned so much from this book and its still a favorite
282071 i still seem to fall back on these classic techniques in all aspects of my cooking
282072 a key work in particular for use in our passover menus
282073 youd be hard pressed to find somebody more qualified out there
282074 i must be very frank with you the north koreans dont like to hear the term human rights but that doesnt mean we shouldnt raise it
282075 it is important for north korea to understand that like it or not this is part of the price of admission to the international community
282076 leftkowitz has been left out of the game for a long time
282077 i left a piece of myself over there in korea so i always try to look out for those guys
282078 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
282079 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
282080 false information that created a very significant link in the public mind between the anthrax attacks and saddam hussein
282081 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
282082 if you go to the entire set of photos here youll see some steampunk stuff like this one

282093 mystics might say i am entering a new seven year cycle i kind of think thats true because i believe there are universal laws and truths

282100 es el nico trabajo que podemos conseguir sabemos de los riesgos que corremos pero no podemos dejar a nuestra familias desamparadas

282102 it would be pretty scary if the bear got a little panicky and some spectator or some of the golfers were too close
282103 that wouldnt have been an issue if a caddie had got too close
282104 on the practice range i felt the best i have in a year and a half two years nothing was hurting and i was like whats wrong with me
282105 it got looser on the front nine his second nine and actually that was pretty good
282106 fortunately i could turn my neck to the left i couldnt turn it to the right ive had it where you cant swing or you cant go to the left but with this i could look up i got through it
282107 the irony of it is that i felt so good on the range and then i felt poorly on the whole back nine
282108 i wasnt really frustrated after the bad start because i felt like i was still playing pretty good and i thought i could make some birdies
282109 the usga put some on us today that almost defy imagination
282110 the greens are so treacherous if you get on the wrong side of one of those ridges it is really tough to get it down in two putts
282111 the difficulty is in getting in the proper section of the green and then trying to negotiate all these severe slopes then youre reading what the mountain is going to do to it the altitude makes club selection a guessing game and that mountain makes reading the putts a little bit of a guessing game
282112 holding companies often go bankrupt once banking units get taken over because most assets and operations are at the bank level
282113 they often file to reorganize but there was probably no viable plan here
282114 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
282115 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously

282120 some problems persist with how individual policy measures are calculated and with their projected emission reductions
282121 individual policy measures continue to be presented without these sources of overestimation adequately being taken into account
282122 the modelling that the government of canada uses is just that modelling it changes year by year depending on the different data that we get
282123 if the cap is not a real hard cap but is an intensity cap so that it depends on growth rates of different sectors then you have to speculate on it
282124 we thought it was on the optimistic side in terms of how much reductions would actually happen

282127 you can bet some of these will be confidence motions
282128 what we will not allow is a situation where mr

282130 our government is ready to face the people on our record and on our vision for the future
282131 were comfortable to face the population anytime we have to
282132 its our strong belief as a government that we are not going to deal with the problems of the canadian economy either now or in the future by imposing more and new taxes on canadians
282133 obviously they smell an election in the offing or else they wouldnt be so open to us
282134 he didnt sound quite as cocky as he used to

282137 the ombudsman shall not perform the duties and functions of his office in regards t contracts with csis and the staff of the senate and house of commons

282140 instead of tacitly supporting raids on factory workers or janitors or construction workers or maids this congress should be working to enact real solutions to our immigration problems
282141 it is my sincere hope that in bringing the stories of the parents children and workers of postville back to congress our lawmakers will see the very real consequences of punitive actions in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform
282142 the church was full of people the rectory was full of people

282144 agriprocessors is the poster child for how companies game our immigration system and how they exploit workers and drive down wages and working conditions in our industries
282145 we know agriprocessors employed children as young as 13 government documents have also exposed allegations of violence against workers they describe a supervisor duct taping a workers eyes and beating him with a meat hook the worker says he was too afraid to come forward and report the incident he was afraid he would be fired
282146 if you take 10 million to 15 million workers out of the country you wouldnt have any meat to eat you wouldnt have any chicken to eat many of your hotel rooms wouldnt be clean and half of all fast food places would close
282147 theres no reason for ice to violate anyones constitutional rights
282148 when we got together at the last reunion there in 2006 some of us said weve got to do something
282149 without the conduit of camp ojiketa wed never have met each other
282150 we dont run as fast but i dont think anything else has changed thats whats so amazing its ojiketa
282151 its the link that has created friendships and helped them last
282152 theres a relationship with the outdoors that we share i dont think theres anyone in the group that doesnt get excited over hearing the call of a loon the moon rising over a lake a sunrise
282153 im from bluff city kan 60 miles southwest of wichita i grew up on a farm and had breathing trouble with the dust in the summer in college i took an elective course camp counseling and ended up at ojiketa i was not too thrilled about the idea of going to camp i was scared stiff thered be a bear around some tree by the end of the first week i was just enthralled
282154 of course i relied on my ojiketa friends to come in and run the waterfront and lead canoe trips
282155 we now have other friends and family to talk about when we get together
282156 we grew up in an era when girls were programmed into certain niches
282157 girls residential camp gave us a sense of power we were just discovering who we were and that we were capable people who could take care of ourselves
282158 a boy might have been able to lift a canoe but we could do it too it might have taken two of us but we could do it i really admired el randels she taught us to be independent and self reliant
282159 her experience loving it there made it ok for my mom and dad to send their second grader off to camp i took to it immediately and looked forward to it every year it was the first thing on my list for santa going to camp next summer
282160 then we picked right up where we left off thats the power of womens friendships
282161 you see we have a serious connection with this piece of land we were like kids again we stayed up until 3 or 4 in the morning laughing and giggling im still on the top bunk
282162 i remember saying we have a cabin if anyone wants to come there feel free
282163 last year we had 10 so far this year were expecting 14 its kind of taken on a life of its own
282164 whether youre in designer jeans or levis youre just campers
282165 we developed our friendship over campfires swimming and crafts only people whove had the camp experience understand said nissen of blue water bay fla who attended the second camp alice earlier this summer
282166 i hear people saying things that i dont think are very christian with respect to people who are gay and lesbian
282167 their professionalism was something i learned from over the past couple years its something a lot of people will have to carry on
282168 were not going to rush i know now hes very excited his brothers here
282169 escolha a paz participa o de donovan local clube dos diretores lojistas av jo o pinheiro belo horizonte
282170 that would not help me instead i always look forward and try to make my decisions work you have to have patience and show the best you can with the car you have
282171 next year there are completely new regulations and we could be at the front
282172 red bull toyota and renault with whom we compare ourselves are now simply faster
282173 one of the best trips ive taken the kids on was to rochester we went to the susan b anthony house this is so much better
282174 everything today is being directed to the student market from the third grade right up to college level
282175 nobodys going out and buying cadillacs this minute but they know theres a possibility that they or their children could benefit from it
282176 we encourage land owners to let us know what their concerns are and what terms and conditions they feel they need to have within the lease
282177 id like him to tell me that i was right that i did the right thing
282178 five things you didnt know about the clearwire wimax deal
282179 at amp t may be hedging its bets by keeping its toes wet in matters wimax this may be more important in the future when wimax standards at the 700 mhz level emerge
282180 the problem is when you have a legal immigration system parallel with an illegal system
282181 i have said im strongly in favor of a comprehensive immigration approach
282182 were probably underrepresenting immigrants from certain parts of the world
282183 its harder for haitians than those from other parts despite similarities in need thats something we should examine
282184 its harder for the ambitious hardworking well qualified poor folks coming into this country
282185 this is a classic example of a no win situation right
282186 so i try to and then people say why are you correcting this thing in a way that isnt sufficiently
282187 do you think you could have come this far if you werent muslim
282188 if on the other hand i cant help them do that then it doesnt matter what my religion is or what my skin color is
282189 so some of our children arent getting more favored treatment than a poor white who has struggled more
282190 i think a university or college should take into account race but also class

282203 it is a dream come true i waited a lot of time before this
282204 the great thing about flavored olive oil is that it is so versatile although i used it as a salad dressing out of convenience the oils could easily be paired with a mild fish or even chicken what i really enjoyed about the blood orange olive oil was the subtle flavor and smooth texture that it added to my crunch salad without being overbearing the o olive oil turned a regular salad into something special i will use this again and again
282205 i thank you for the opportunity i was given to use the o olive oil i will be using it very often making the same salad and trying the other recipes included thank you so much
282206 as soon as i opened the bottle i was greeted with one of the freshest scents i have ever smelled the combination of olive oil and meyer lemons creates such a fantastic aroma that i was sold on this product before tasting it it really smells that fresh i wanted to use it in every part of my meal but settled on a makeshift garlic crostini an appetizer well complemented by this wonderful olive oil for the garlic crostini we spread the olive oil over 1 4 inch thick slices of french baguette we then crushed tomatoes and mixed it with minced garlic salt and pepper we topped each piece of the crostini with the mixture and baked for 10 minutes in a 350 degree oven the hint of lemon really added to the flavor to make a great appetizer overall i really enjoyed the quality of this olive oil not only was the meyer lemon flavor fantastic it felt like the kind of olive oil id find in a high class italian restaurant its the type of olive oil i want to mix with parmesan cheese and smother all over everything great product i highly recommend it
282207 let me begin by telling you that the recipe i used was
282208 thick 1 lb fresh brussels sprouts trimmed and cut in halves 1 large onion sliced 1 4
282209 this is a family favorite recipe that i make frequently with plain olive oil using the o olive oil with the lemon flavor was such a refreshing addition it managed to bring out the delicate flavors of the root vegetables as well as a new twist on the red bell peppers and the brussels sprouts this recipe makes a large amount so is excellent for large family meals i was very favorably impressed with the product and look forward to using it in other dishes

282222 i dont like to come in real early my mom is going to try and wake me up early but im gonna get through it
282223 i personally feel that students need more than just reading and writing they need those other activities
282224 it keeps the kids off the streets and it helps them
282225 if they go to school and have small breaks it keeps them occupied

282231 our government takes the issue of climate change very seriously
282232 orgops help is likely to be of the order of holding our jewelry while we get water boarded
282233 we whole heartedly disagree with his decision to publicly endorse obama and merkley and encouraged him to reconsider
282234 but because he is our republican candidate we will continue to offer him the support from the oregon republican party that we offer all our other candidates
282235 the purpose of the letter was to let them know where we stood on the issue
282236 there has been a series of provoking emails between many of you and mr haugen many of which have been forwarded to the media and i believe directly impacted the news coverage of this situation
282237 without the email trail to forward to the press this story would have more than likely died
282238 theyve indicated they will support him the way they will
282239 my understanding is we are still operating on under the conditions we voted on the bottom line is we will support the candidates that support republican candidates you cross a line when you publicly endorse the top two people on the ticket
282240 were going to continue to give him the support that he needs
282241 since joels views dont really adhere to modern republican ideology theres a lot more explaining joel has to do
282242 our job as far as communications goes is more difficult which is why joel would prefer to have more social capital instead of having a few big money donors
282243 the purpose of the letter was to let them know where we stood on the issue
282244 should the county parties decide that they no longer want to support haugen then thats their decision
282245 the republican party has always been a big tent party which is accepting of all people and their views we are encouraged by joel haugens grassroots campaign and know that his message of changing a broken washington will be well received by oregon voters come november
282246 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure with barack obama for better gas mileage

282248 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
282249 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans

282302 people think that we are prohibited from getting an education and being engaged in society
282303 we are all open minded and respect each others beliefs
282304 i think its good for the community to have the opportunity to be represented by muslims and hopefully the community will also feel empowered that six muslim women attorneys are representing them
282305 you may not be used to seeing it but this is what muslim women in america look like
282306 were educated and were professionals and were not an anomaly

282355 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
282356 significant numbers appear to hold beliefs which contravene democratic values
282357 these results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said there is no extremism in british universities
282358 our researchers found a ghettoized mentality among muslim students at queen mary college
282359 also we found the segregation between muslim men and women at events more visible at queen mary
282360 clearly we in no way associate ourselves with these views however also integral to the spirit of university life is free speech and debate and on occasion speakers will make statements that are deemed offensive
282361 this disgusting report is a reflection of the biases and prejudices of a right wing think tank not the views of muslim students across britain only 632 muslim students were asked vague and misleading questions and their answers were willfully misinterpreted
282362 dangerous increase in the spread of extremism in leading university campuses
282363 the finding that a large number of students think it is okay to kill in the name of religion is alarming
282364 we are proud to have carried out this operation and we congratulated our brothers for completing this task we timed the attack in such a way that no muslims were in the vicinity
282365 suicide attacks are justified by islamic sharia however islamic scholars who are affiliated with governments issue whatever fatwas they are told to issue however suicide attacks inside mosques are forbidden
282366 the pakistani government is the government that has caused the greatest damage to the mujahideen it was pakistani president pervez musharraf who caused the most damage to his neighbors the mujahideen of the taliban though it was only thanks to their sacrifice that the ussr did not invade pakistan in the 1980s
282367 khaled is a fearless man of whom the entire muslim nation can be proud
282368 the allegation that al qaeda is promoting u s interests is a lie
282369 this is a lie and falsehood and was exposed as such years ago when sheikh osama bin laden declared jihad against the u s since then al qaeda has carried out a series of operations against the u s first the attacks on the u s embassies in kenya and tanzania then the attacks on u s targets in yemen and somalia and culminating in the pious action of 9 11 this series of attacks on the u s is clear proof that this allegation namely that al qaeda is promoting u s interests is nothing but a lie and falsehood

282445 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
282446 i think people have realised that there are not going to be any resolutions and some feel frustrated and wanted some kind of definitive statements to take home with them part of what this process is about is listening to different viewpoints the drafters of the covenant will revise the covenant in the light of these its the only sensible way it may seem a long drawn out process but it will go to the anglican consultative council and then come back to the provinces who will then decide if it is acceptable to them or not there is no point in submitting it to churches now who will tear it apart the windsor continuation group has involved listening to the reactions to the proposals and it will go away and these further suggestions will be brought to the anglican consultative council and then go to the provinces

282453 domestic sales continued to weaken in the second quarter given challenging market conditions
282454 as a result the company has taken considerable steps to reduce ongoing operating expenses as evidenced by the recent reduction in corporate workforce in addition i am spending a considerable amount of time in the field working to restore sales activity while several factors have contributed to slower than anticipated growth in our associate numbers the company believes that the wellness industry will grow domestically and that our direct sales channel is capable of restoring sales growth to historic levels
282455 market deterioration from a weakened economy and overhang from other external issues has had an inevitable impact on our sales growth however demand for our proprietary products among our loyal customers has remained strong and we continue to find efficiencies through tight control of our operations mannatech is moving forward

282460 i waited and waited until the temperature and rock friction was perfect and at 9 p m exactly all this preparation over months crystallized and i led the route in a dream state of confident execution
282461 how disparate the ingredients of a good performance are and how big an effect it has on the rare occasions when they come together at just the right moment
282462 that the richer queen jane was dressed the fairer she appeared on the contrary the better anne boleyn was apparelled the worse she looked but that queen jane was the fairest of all henrys wives
282463 jane seymour was the fairest the discreetest and the most meritorious of all henry viii s wives
282464 paid considerable attention to jane seymour before her predecessor anne boleyn was dead which along with the fact that none of those executed with her except the organist mark smeaton admitted the deed any more than she had made people think he invented the ploy just to get rid of her nevertheless the woman herself suffered no great injustice by this for she was well known to be a worthless character i think that women will not be all that happy if such ways of going on become the custom and with good reason and although i do not intend to take the risk myself yet for the sake of the female sex i will pray like the rest that god will protect us

282472 yeah so anyway when did you see the victim last
282473 i saw him once he started the conga line kinda lost track of where he was though
282474 yeah right all i can tell you is he was a terrible dancer wearing cheap cologne
282475 its candy cool real name randy w malone and his cologne was all testosterone baby
282476 usually but sometimes this short guy came with him billy or something like that
282477 yeah but did you know that withholding information can get you jail time
282478 a puncture wound in the back looks like from a small double sided knife
282479 uhhh hey guys you might want to check this out he appears to have a g string stuffed down his throat
282480 well grissom it looks like our stripper guy had not only a puncture wound to the neck but he also had a gun shot wound in the right thigh that lodged in a major artery
282481 well anyway the vic was wearing pink high heels and had a g string shoved down his throat any ideas
282482 but still even in vegas what was he the sugar plum fairy
282483 you gotta be kidding me catherine you mean to say he was a hermaphrodite
282484 seems that way she or rather he used his feminine side its all an illusion anyway
282485 this makes me wonder why i ever came to vegas in the first place
282486 aw come on you know you love the surprises the job just wouldnt be the same with out them
282487 um im good may i ask why you are traumatised
282488 surprise me i think i am beyond surprises but by all means prove me wrong
282489 what do we know about our afrodite guy huh and before you answer what do you think about having dinner tonight
282490 im detective jim brass of the lvpd and your name is
282491 hey cath i just talked with the cleaning guy he looks suspicious to me
282492 huh are you sure he was the cleaning guy the owner told us he fired him 2 weeks ago and that now he was the cleaning guy
282493 well thats good news for brass what about the other guy
282494 all they are gonna see is an intentional act of murder
282495 youre supposed to be dead i investigated your murder oh my god grissom
282496 economic reports havent been all that good this past week
282497 now that earnings season is largely over attention is turning back to oil and more fundamental reports
282498 demand for hardwood lumber which traditionally increases in the second quarter declined both year over year and sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2008 as a number of our furniture cabinet and millwork manufacturing customers reduced production
282499 prices for hardwood lumber also declined adding to the negative sales impact
282500 sentiment is more focused on slowing demand rather than short term supply disruptions
282501 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
282502 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
282503 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
282504 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
282505 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
282506 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
282507 dont forget just as 48 has risen theres someone else whos going to rise before chase time
282508 i must have a trillion different passwords for a trillion different websites
282509 people will absolutely shut off the spending spigots given the soured jobs market
282510 its easy to see why consumer spending is expected to remain weak through the summer if not the rest of the year
282511 his performance was down because his team was out it
282512 its safe to say to all of you guys that im in discussions for whats best for my career
282513 i thought it was going to be a tear or something like that
282514 i still think i can help this team in a big way
282515 last night i was getting ready to go to sleep and thinking about today and different things about the racing and what im going to be looking for out of my race car
282516 last time when we came here i had no idea what to expect
282517 we had an opportunity to go to dover last year and try to qualify for the race
282518 i think we practiced like 38th fast and then went out to qualify and i think ended up 47th out of 49 car that were there that day we were pretty disappointed about that
282519 but then we go back there in june and we qualified 16th and we got a top 20 run 18th at the end of the day
282520 i think that just shows how much easier it is the second time you go to a track and just know what to expect out of these cars and what youre looking for out of the car
282521 obviously coming back to a track for me is just experience and gives you confidence
282522 but as a team were working through this new car and being able to come back with a baseline starting point is only going to help us to improve our performance
282523 you get an hour and then you qualify and where you qualify really dictates how your weekend is going to go
282524 not having to worry about figuring out the racing line and figuring out what you need to do that first hour and be able to just go out there and work on the car and work on your qualifying trim is going to be a big thing
282525 the unknown of what to expect from the new car as the races go on is going to be a little bit less now that were going back the second time to these places
282526 last year i couldnt even breathe getting in the car for qualifying because it was so nerve racking for me
282527 now i have the confidence in the team that we have a fast enough car to just go out there and put a lap down and not just make the race but qualifying in the top 10 and run up front
282528 its definitely a lot better but i dont want to do it much longer
282529 the track is fine its perfect its the same track for everyone
282530 the more bumps and the more patches and cracks and character it has i think the better thats my take on racetracks is that theyre not supposed to be perfect
282531 we think about it every week top 10 finishes are what we need to do to secure our spot in the chase and go to new york for the postseason awards ceremony and all that were working hard at it
282532 i dont watch a lot of football when i go home i dont talk about it much when i go home im not a coach im a dad its just the way it is and always will be when it gets to a point where im losing the balance its time for me to go do something else
282533 i think being the football coach here at nebraska is a little different than some places where you can just stay in your office and put a product on the field and thats how youre judged
282534 people here want to know you want to get to see you and so i think its important there be some outreach
282535 it doesnt matter if its 5 oclock in the morning hes ready to roll thats the biggest thing that i like about him hes always trying to motivate you and making sure youre doing the right thing
282536 on the field im going to do it the way i see fit and with my belief systems and let it all hang out that way
282537 i cant try and please everybody i have to be who i am and do the things i think will help us be successful
282538 off the field i have to do things as a husband and father that are necessary to satisfy my no 1 job and thats to be a father and a husband
282539 that kind of put everyone into a bit of a tizzy just because he was there
282540 what people dont understand especially if theres a night game is if youre not prepared by that morning something isnt right
282541 the perception out there is that to be a great football coach you have to work 24 hours a day i dont see it
282542 ive never worked that way i never will work that way
282543 one of the real hazards of the coaching profession is that you can become so consumed with coaching that your family suffers greatly
282544 im glad to see that bo and his coaches are going to try to strike a balance there because you can lock yourself in your office 15 hours a day and you can do that 365 days a year and it really isnt healthy
282545 it comes down to how we do they love me now
282546 i put myself in a bad situation and i did not handle it the right way
282547 i was wrong and made a mistake my girlfriend my attorney and i wanted a quick resolution and knew that a suspension could happen
282548 we had knowledge of fabians situation prior to the trade we made for him
282549 fabian knows his actions were a mistake and has taken appropriate actions since then
282550 he got thrown in there with the sharks and he didnt drown
282551 he didnt get eaten at all he did a pretty good job of playing last year this year he has a training camp under his belt and a little consistency so its going to be good for him
282552 hes a rookie right now to this training camp thing
282553 hes hitting a little wall its to be expected since its his first one hes a pro hes competitive hes going to be ok
282554 i feel like a fifth year player from what i experienced last year
282555 i was going against chad johnson and a couple of those great receivers
282556 i think the coaches did a great job of just giving me the basic things to do on defense
282557 now you look at it and youre like dang i did this or did that they just said it was ok and just be patient
282558 im definitely smarter im just a student of the game im getting more wisdom in my brain and listening to coach and taking heed of it
282559 you never know what youre going to get from your freshman year to your sophomore year especially if a guy has got a ton of success
282560 and darrelle really did have a nice season last year for such a young guy and hes responded in ways as a coach youre always excited to see
282561 i understand the defensive schemes more and i understand what im supposed to do at certain times
282562 last year i knew a couple of plays in the playbook and now its being smarter and learning the whole defense
282563 thats an area that weve got to keep developing with him
282564 it would be id say more of a substitution type role or a specialty role as opposed to being the primary guy back there
282565 lockdown corner thats a big phrase and a phrase where you shut it down
282566 you shut everything down if youre watching the best receiver on somebodys team you limit him to catches and you just shut him down
282567 theyve obviously done well being in first place without me to this point
282568 in search of winning a world series title that was important my kids are getting older and it wasnt the situation in seattle where i wanted to get closer to home it was a chance for me winning a title i think that was the biggest draw
282569 i had just bought a mustang and i just shifted wrong
282570 i had a 7 a m appointment with my trainer and i had just pulled out of my driveway it had rained all night and the roads were slick and i just shifted a little too quick and hit a pole going about 35 miles an hour it just jumped right out in front of me
282571 i had my foot on the gas a little too much and when i let the clutch out it spun the wheels and then it whipped around it happened so fast
282572 my ball striking was terrible sometimes youve just got to make a change seans got a lot of good stuff to say and approaches things a little bit different i spent 30 minutes on the range with sean and it was an immediate improvement i think were making some nice headway
282573 but you do think about it you think about playing in the world series every day and i have an opportunity to achieve that goal
282574 our intent is to win the american league central division and ultimately to win another world series championship
282575 adding a player the caliber of ken griffey jr gives us a better chance to realize those goals
282576 you just go out there and read the ball off the bat its a little easier than playing right
282577 we want to thank zach for his time with the red bulls organization
282578 he is the consummate professional and we wish him well with this move to chivas usa this is an opportunity for zach to compete for a starting role and we did not want to stand in his way
282579 its a public safety issue not just to the consuming public but also to employees who really dont have a choice if theyre employed in a business that has an outdoor dining area that allows smoking
282580 any non enclosed are located on private or public property made available to or customarily used by the general public that is designed established or regularly used for consuming food and or beverages or where food and or beverages are served whether or not for compensation
282581 i will not be able to provide that service and cigarette butts are going to end up in our storm drains and sewage system
282582 health is one of the main purposes of local government
282583 we have to protect peoples health and safety if we cant do that then representation is missing from every city
282584 i do think there is room for accommodations in a way that there will really not be an infliction on the comfort of the general public at large
282585 when we bury joey lets take the shovels that you will find there and let us do joey the honor of filling up his grave to ground level said movable minyan president pini herman in his eulogy
282586 lets do it ourselves and let the mortuary backhoe tractor sit idle in its infinitesimally reduced carbon footprint as our last physical homage to joeys enthusiasm do it yourself attitude and love of nature
282587 read one harry potter book if you like then read seven easy readers just so you can meet the goal
282588 yes of course just because you asked its perfectly all right if johnny susie gets the same prize as the children who followed the rules and met the goal
282589 fiquei satisfeito com o que produzi contra o n utico espero repetir a boa atua o
282590 o r mulo um jogador que eu confio que eu acho que importante e que cumpre a sua fun o pode iniciar como pode aguardar ent o vamos deixar o caio l pensando um pouquinho
282591 cada partida tem uma hist ria diferente mas se eu tiver a oportunidade de atuar e se a chance de marcar surgir eu vou aparecer para concluir a gol
282592 as mudan as em rela o ao ltimo jogo eu deixo o caio l pensando um pouquinho eu j tenho uma id ia de jogo acho que todo mundo sem a bola marca independente do n mero de jogadores na frente e da liberdade que voc d a determinados jogadores
282593 o ipatinga est na zona de rebaixamento mas venceu alguns jogos como contra o inter em casa e empatou com o s o paulo no morumbi temos que respeitar o time deles mas vamos pra l precisando da vit ria
282594 esse tipo de jogo contra amea ados mais dif cil falam que mais f cil mas n o voc tem que entrar em campo aplicado e concentrado para n o ser surpreendido
282595 temos que ir pra l preparados para o mais dif cil ver o ipatinga como uma pedra muito grande existe uma press o natural pela vit ria por ser um jogo contra o lanterna mas a torcida deve comparecer para empurrar o time deles que almeja sair dessa situa o
282596 nessa altura do campeonato n o d pra vacilar contra mais ningu m n o podemos perder mais pontos porque o gr mio abriu quatro de vantagem temos que vencer fora de casa e torcer por trope os do gr mio

282604 its going to be a whole new place were going to come back here in five years and say we planted that
282605 a lot of kids play here and they need a clean and safe place to play
282606 we can draw upon the older fields of ethology the study of animal behavior in the wild learning theories human psychology and animal behavior in the non veterinary world we know how animals communicate so we know what dogs and cats do to show that theyre anxious or aggressive we read them that way
282607 avoidance at one end of the spectrum as a defense mechanism to killing someone so theres a wide range of aggression
282608 simply to reduce anxiety in a pet to the point where behavior modification training can take effect
282609 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
282610 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
282611 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
282612 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that

282633 you have just no idea how exhaustive the chinese have been when it comes to security
282634 i know the man they appointed to run security for the olympics when they won the rights to have them he was called in by the government minister and told the reputation of the peoples republic rests on your shoulders
282635 we shut down our critics shut down internet pages our government is too nervous about the western media to be a big nation you should be able to listen to criticism
282636 the world media is overly optimistic about chinas economy i dont agree with it
282637 we are developing quickly no doubt we may be the most populous country but we have a lot of problems our factories have low efficiencies we have wasted a lot of energy on things that didnt matter
282638 our culture has a problem our education system has problems maybe we are exporting lots of goods but we have hurt our environment doing it
282639 our pollution is already affecting other nations crossing our borders into theirs other countries regard us as a threat but it is not the economy or our numbers that is the threat it is what we have done to this land
282640 we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors but borrow it from our children
282641 we have spent so much time watching the west and not understanding it because we do not speak its language therefore we do not quite know how it thinks and what it thinks of us
282642 democracy should be given time to develop even people with democracy dont know how to use it

282660 we believe the challenger of record has to be a real yacht club it cannot be something that is manufactured with a defender to set up a one sided event this decision would set an absurd precedent
282661 we believe we have an excellent case for winning on appeal
282662 i put myself in a bad situation and i did not handle it the right way
282663 i was wrong and made a mistake my girlfriend my attorney and i wanted a quick resolution and knew that a suspension could happen
282664 we had knowledge of fabians situation prior to the trade we made for him
282665 based on the nfls personal conduct policy and fabians agreement with the authorities we knew that a suspension was a possibility fabian knows his actions were a mistake and has taken appropriate actions since then
282666 having played with her for quite a while and from a pitchers standpoint she was an impact player
282667 when i was on the mound and knowing she was behind me was reassuring if anything was catchable she would get it
282668 i think the rest of the world has gotten better
282669 they other countries werent ready in 1996 but the rest of the world has been playing the game for six years so they have caught up to the united states
282670 laura made some of the best catches i have ever seen in the outfield
282671 thats the thing with laura she might not have been the fastest player on the team but she got the quickest jump on the ball its almost like she had a crystal ball to see where the ball would be hit before it actually was
282672 a lot of people thought lisa would be a four time olympian but laura was always the team player and she will be the only four time olympian in the history of usa softball
282673 that just shows the type of person and athlete that she is it was never for show for her it was about her team usa red white and blue and thats what personifies
282674 i know the team inside and out i think they are well prepared
282675 even if laura is not a regular starting member her role on the sidelines will be as important as if she was on the field i think they will be more challenged this year but lauras leadership will help guide the team to the top laura might be the veteran but she is still the prankster on the team she has the ability to keep things light and knows when to turn that switch and be serious thats another great quality for her that will help her lead this team to greatness

282681 we still have some legal issues to resolve and in due course after sentencing we will be lodging an appeal
282682 there are always issues and there are some particular issues in this case i dont want to go into the grounds but there are some substantial ones
282683 at the end of the day the question is has the person received a fair trial if there are deficiencies in the summing up and the way it proceeds the defence is entitled to proceed and i am saying that there are matters to be canvassed
282684 to get through the other end of a second trial is a hell of a relief
282685 it is a very big relief to the police officers who have been involved in this we are very close to the family of james te aute and the other victims in this and part of it was relief on our part on their behalf

282695 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
282696 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
282697 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
282698 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
282699 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
282700 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
282701 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
282702 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
282703 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
282704 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
282705 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
282706 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
282707 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

282711 when a child leaves home to go to school the teachers become the next guardians i cannot bail out a teacher who defiles pupils irrespective of whether they are my voters or not
282712 but the problem is that in some cases parents are compromised by accepting money and the offending teachers walk away scot free
282713 although we are carrying out arrests and over 4 000 defilers have been charged we should go an extra mile by bringing the teachers on board through sensitising them
282714 girls from p 5 to p 7 are undergoing adolescence and are therefore adventurous and vibrant because their bodies are undergoing several changes if a teacher does not realise this they end up messing up with these pupils
282715 we are moving around schools telling these children that they can get unwanted pregnancies get sexually transmitted diseases like hiv aids on top of dropping out of school
282716 a teacher is by law not supposed to have any sexual relations with his pupils if they do they are breaking the law and contravening their professional code of conduct

282737 comcasts practices are not minimally intrusive as the company claims but rather are invasive and have significant effects
282738 in essence comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein
282739 gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine
282740 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to websites or online applications including peer to peer services
282741 considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
282742 such video distribution poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand vod service
282743 comcasts throttling of legal internet traffic had nothing to do with network management as the company claims
282744 it had everything to do with a big company trying to exert its power over a captive internet market

282895 perfect thy work o lord and for thy glory make us all thine own so that all the members of this congregation even to the day of judgement may continue to please thee perfectly and to gain for thee a countless number of souls amen amen

283145 my effort to provide a comprehensive analysis of japanese nationalism has occupied indeed all too often preoccupied my thinking research and publications for most of my professional career
283146 much of what is written about japanese nationalism is not really about nationalism at all this is the first paradox that anyone who wishes to understand the past present and future of japanese nationalism must confront it is not only true about academic writing on nationalism in japan but
283147 put succinctly nationalism is a principle that asserts the people as the privileged principle of political life but this principle of the people is more than a political one it makes certain claims that go to the heart of identity individual and collective and as such it can place itself in a conflicting relationship with the state it certainly did so for much of modern japanese history

283192 july 23 2008 has been one of the saddest days of my life when i was informed through the media of the summary expulsion from my membership of the cpi m for seriously compromising the position of the party
283193 in the computation of the strength of either the ruling party or its allies or of the opposition no responsible person or authority can treat the speaker as belonging to or extending support either to the government or its allies or to the opposition
283194 it was the decision of the party that i should resign and vote against the motion and when i refused subsequently it was suggested that i should resign as speaker and may not attend the house to cast my vote
283195 i informed him of my inability to accept such decision or to act upon the same as it will seriously compromise the constitutional position of the speaker

283200 what makes nitol interesting is it is an existing chemical producer which produced a number of intermediates that go into producing polysilicon as well as other traditional petrochemicals
283201 theyre highly suited for this particular project because they have access to cheap raw materials particularly to low cost hydropower and have the know how based off of their years of being in a chemical business and understanding how to work with these kinds of products
283202 there are something like 100 projects that have been announced in this area but we know many of them will not happen because it is also combined with the pullback from the global and equity markets

283210 61 days and 2 1 billion gallons of water later the evans road wildfire is 80 contained while there are a few hot spots left firefighters say they have made a lot of progress
283211 looking at rehabilitating sites where weve had pumps and fire caused damage to land area
283212 when you start talking about peat soils organic soils in down east firefighting it becomes very hard very difficult to get water exactly where you need it the peat soils are partly a carbon component so its kind of like a charcoal briquette once it ignites it just smolders
283213 just as mother nature started this fire crews say shell likely be the one to put it out regardless firefighters will be keeping a close eye on it
283214 engineers from the state department of transportation says they can assure each and every one of us that any open bridge in north carolina is safe to travel on but heres the catch over 2 000 bridges require significant maintenance and will eventually need to be replaced
283215 it is a looming problem but at the same time we feel we have a good prioritization system in place
283216 i think we really have to be creative in how we will go at replacing more of these bridges because a lot of structures were built forty to fifty years ago

283224 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
283225 we have argued repeatedly that there is no need for federal legislation in this area and todays fcc action proves that point
283226 without making a judgment on the substance of todays ruling it is clear that the federal communication commission is prepared to uphold its broadband principles
283227 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission ftc engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
283228 the once felt urgency for congressional action obviously subsided once fcc chairman kevin martin emerged as a consumers rights advocate
283229 i intend to continue monitoring practices in the industry and pressing for passage of my legislative framework for addressing these issues in the months ahead
283230 the vast majority of network management practices that are being used today will be permissible under the fccs framework
283231 the ones that are problems are ones that are too expansive they target specific protocols and applications even when theres no network congestion but techniques used to identify heavy users and reduce their traffic during peak loads is in principle permissible
283232 were always evaluating our broadband plans and services but have nothing new to announce today regarding our pricing structure
283233 with that said given the usage trends were seeing usage based pricing is one way to deal fairly with internet usage which is very uneven among broadband users
283234 when people make the argument that isps will have to meter traffic its a false choice
283235 going to a tiered model is an economic approach some operators are choosing to go in that direction but there are plenty that can use reasonable network management methods to manage their networks
283236 when i began taking these pills i could not sleep my patterns went all out of whack i then developed a lot of digestive problems
283237 after about five years of being back i began to forget things and ended up having to give up my career and driving licence because i could no longer focus
283238 i didnt know what was happening i still have a poor memory and this affects me daily
283239 i just hope this conference can help others from suffering from what one doctor close to me calls the invisible injury
283240 it is the only silver lining in what otherwise is a dark inflation cloud

283245 we have made clear to all the main parties our views on controls on candidate spending before elections
283246 we have said for some time that we think the current regulated period for candidate spending is too short but that any change in the rules would need to address the scope for uncertainty and avoidance
283247 it may be possible to achieve this with the right combination of statutory rules and commission guidance however we would want to consider any changes carefully to ensure our guidance works with any changes to the law to achieve a fair framework for all candidates

283253 on balance the committee was not persuaded of the case for separating the attorney generals legal and political functions the attorney should retain these two roles
283254 gordon browns ambition to reinvigorate our democracy will never be realised by the ragbag of retreats embodied in his constitutional renewal bill
283255 in particular this bill will fail to rekindle public confidence in the sullied office of attorney general since it ducks the opportunity to separate her legal and political functions
283256 the majority report is very disappointing and is more reactionary than the government
283257 however i agree with the view of the minority that there should be a separation of the attorney generals legal and political functions
283258 he was never really an anonymous sperm donor he always was present in the childrens lives
283259 kind of a smooth and what i would consider a supportive relationship in terms of the kids
283260 and he wasnt interested in the accompanying responsibility to provide financial support for the kids
283261 we know that he was a diabetic he completed a series of questions at booking it was indicated that he was perhaps having a diabetic reaction
283262 they thought it was that 74 and i would have told them no 74 is not fine for him
283263 common sense comes into play if they felt there was a medical issue at that time when they came into contact with him then he would have been taken to the hospital but that wasnt the case at all
283264 he would have done anything for anybody he was always there if you need him and he always loved to make you laugh

283300 weve had several detectives look this case over in the last 27 years they would just go back and look at it with a fresh set of eyes and conduct interviews on anyone that could possibly have any knowledge about the case
283301 they just hit a bunch of brick walls in january a new team of detectives put galloway under surveillance and this thing fell into place
283302 galloway has no idea hes being watched the entire time hes eating
283303 when hes done and gets up to leave they go in the garbage and get the utensils he was eating with thats how they got the dna they needed
283304 there were a lot of resources spent on this case and in the end it really was science teamed up with some outstanding police work that gave us the break in the case
283305 any time you can team those two factors and bring someone to justice and give a family some closure even after 27 years thats what police work is all about

283310 its unbelievable that one of the greatest quarterbacks is put on the sideline and cannot play this great game
283311 for us it seems to have come out of nowhere
283312 were trying to follow it as close as we can
283313 now this is kind of just getting confusing and you dont know whats going on whats happening im camping this week so i dont know whats happening today whats happening this morning
283314 i just hope its over it should be over let him come back play ball have fun
283315 theres got to be a resolution its got to end this cant go on forever
283316 i wish they would come to some kind of agreement so it could just be done and we dont have to keep being in controversy
283317 i could hear kids screaming and stuff i thought they were swimming everybody swims on the train bridge up there and i just thought they were swimming and yelling and having a good time
283318 i was barely starting on the bridge very hot and humid day like today in green bay and i just saw it before i heard anything i saw this big plume of smoke go up on the south end above the trees
283319 one of my first reactions when i got to the scene myself about ten minutes after it happened was god made up his mind real quickly who made it and who didnt
283320 i got to a point where i could look down on the scene crumpled cars i saw one couple their suv had slid down one car had bent their frame of the suv and theyre getting out through their sunroof
283321 a policeman i remember him sticking his head into one of these you could barely tell it was a car and looking in there for a good 30 seconds to a minute and just kind of shaking his head and walked away you just knew that that person had not made it
283322 and thats all it takes and you live with it for the rest of your life
283323 i think its fair to say that but j t osullivan has to stay ready
283324 but from a repetition standpoint theres no way of getting around that two guys are going to take more of the reps
283325 to me the competition doesnt change how i approach any situation
283326 its about me getting better me preparing as hard as i can and performing when my opportunity comes
283327 were doing it in a fashion that keeps it fair
283328 if osullivan is going to replace somebodys reps hell take those reps
283329 the coaches know its a little tired and they felt like i needed a rest
283330 so thats what we did looks like well be ready to go now
283331 as i said in the spring and ill continue to say it it is a battle between three guys
283332 again j t osullivan still has less reps but he had an opportunity to get some so he got them

283365 i also had a quick hands on play with the 360 code more on this later but i was far more impressed by the landscape and setting than i expected admittedly i was only on for about an hour but the novelty of wrecked concrete bridges 50s paraphernalia and two headed cows didnt wear off the epic draw distance helped too it certainly felt that you could see more than in oblivion though obviously fallouts wasteland has a few less trees than cyrodiil
283366 and really what matters in the end is whats taking place in payrolls and the unemployment rate and theyre both moving in the direction of a labor market recession how can you argue with that

283373 he who does not love has not become acquainted with god for god is love
283374 what do i really know about god and his heart what do i really know about his mercy and compassion
283375 steeped in humility we are called to act justly and to love mercy dont miss this justice is an action to be done in and through the power of christian community but mercy is to be loved it is not an action it is a passion

283389 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat

283391 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union said a wal mart customer service supervisor from missouri i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote she said
283392 wal mart executives claim that employees at unionized stores would have to pay hefty union dues while getting nothing in return and may have to go on strike without compensation also unionization could mean fewer jobs as labor costs rise
283393 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
283394 we have to make sure we are prepared for every option
283395 but we will not let the second holocaust take place

283401 in a balanced manner various countries aspirations for nuclear power
283402 as a developing country china knows well that energy is important to living standards and social progress it is always chinas view that each country has the right to carry out activities related to the peaceful use of nuclear energy
283403 will reinforce the non proliferation regime for which the european union is committed
283404 we believe it will make a significant contribution to energy and climate security
283405 it also represents a gain for the non proliferation regime by bringing india further into and thereby strengthening the broader non proliferation framework
283406 todays agreement represents a major step forward to opening civil nuclear cooperation with india while strengthening the worlds non proliferation regime
283407 the conclusion of such a safeguards agreement raises pertinent questions about the status and fate of the non proliferation regime
283408 double standards policy of the us which has undermined the credibility integrity and universality of the npt
283409 we have made it clear we are looking for a clean unconditional exception
283410 did not want to get into what is a clean exemption or whether any other word would be better
283411 we have been consistent looking forward we need the exemption to resume full nuclear cooperation with the world
283412 there is a lot of detailing before the first order the iaea is an enabling agreement
283413 we will look for practical ways to minimise the hardships
283414 it is a banned organisation and india will not slacken its vigil in this regard
283415 global efforts to promote energy security sustainable development and effective non proliferation will stand to gain with india as a partner
283416 our national export controls will remain on par with best international standards we have our principled and consistent position on nuclear non proliferation and disarmament issues we remain firm in our commitment to realize the vision of the rajiv gandhi action plan for universal non discriminatory nuclear disarmament leading to complete elimination of nuke weapons
283417 india will implement the agreement in strict accordance with its provisions in implementing it india and the agency can build on the excellent co operative relations that have so happily existed between us
283418 this is an important day for india and a significant milestone in the longstanding co operation between india and the agency
283419 we can still exercise our sovereign rights to conduct tests
283420 we thought it was maybe a circus or a carnival that was going on here but were very happy with the price
283421 i guess if you want the business you drop the price
283422 i was assured that id have it a week before it expired
283423 we recognize that this has not gone as smooth as we would obviously like
283424 what were being told by the vendor is that has been corrected as well
283425 what i promise is we are diligently trying to correct these issues as they crop up and address the individual citizens and work with them to get the license that they came in to get in the first place

283462 weve worked together and there are a number of clinton supporters on the platform committee itself
283463 youre doing it for the wrong reason anybody whos in it ought to be in it for whats best for the country you ought to believe in the democratic process the democratic process chose sen obama and i think it was a good choice

283471 hes a different guy but hes definitely not a bad guy there was definitely a different sense that was going in the clubhouse over the last week it was uncomfortable not so much for the players because were used to things going on but with his relationship with upper management it was different it was a weird feeling in here
283472 we should celebrate the fact that he was such good player for us
283473 i think people may tend to blame him for everything that has gone wrong with this team so far this year and i dont think thats right either but we still have a lot of games left we have a very good player in jason bay and we cant cry whether mannys gone or not hes not on our team and we want to team this around because we havent been playing good baseball we just want to play good baseball
283474 things got to the point where they had to do something and they did theyre happy mannys happy im going to miss my man im not going to lie to you but were looking forward the team needed it
283475 things escalated to degrees where something had to be done either way either way i think its a relief that theres closure to something thats been going on for the last week or 10 days im just relieved theres an actual solution which there was going to be regardless on this day
283476 from the front office standpoint i feel like this did have to happen sometimes you make decisions regardless of whether you got a worse player or better player out of that deal it makes your team as a whole better i think thats what their decisions was based on that feeling of camaraderie and 25 guys playing for the same goal
283477 its pretty exciting it has been kind of a whirlwind when the trade deadline was done at 4 oclock i didnt hear anything i didnt hear anything until about a half hour after that we were getting on a bus to go to chicago when he was told of the deal my head was spinning
283478 here i am i cant wait i was traded three times in the minor leagues before getting to pittsburgh its not the same grand scale but im equipped to handle this if i was a free agent i couldnt have picked a better place to come to the atmosphere the winning its something im really looking forward to

283515 institutional discrimination is built into the normal working relationships of institutions its perpetuation requires only that people continue business as usual its eradication requires much more than good will it requires active review of the assumptions and practices by which the institution operates and revision of those found to have discriminatory results
283516 ethnic nationalism is either right or wrong not only wrong when whites do it and right when non whites do it if white nationalism is wrong then so is any kind of ethnic nationalism

283523 its the same people running the meetings or the same people are part of a few overlapping organisations there are no stepping stones no mentorship no room to grow into involvement
283524 sometimes if you work with one group you risk alienating a wing of your organisational core
283525 the vitality of the left is only realized when its related to that broad cross section of folks in the political centre we must do whatever we can to engage and activate and leverage that anti war majority

283530 every day folks across virginia and the nation are confronted with the rising cost of energy from the cost at the pump to soaring electric bills
283531 i believe that virginia should have every tool available to access its energy supplies unfortunately a congressional moratorium on exploration of the ocs prevents the commonwealth from having every tool available to address rising energy costs
283532 while the majority in congress has succeeded in strangling any efforts to tap into traditional energy resources in america our nations citizens have suffered they have suffered with skyrocketing gas and food prices and they have suffered from the fear that we are ever dependent on foreign and sometimes hostile nations for our oil supply while congress cant seem to get its act together to solve this problem for the nation as a representative of the people of virginia i cannot stand by and simply watch this spectacle the time for action is now

283544 police asked us to give the names and addresses of youth who lost their parents or siblings in the 2002 riots
283545 three days after the blasts i was called for questioning by vadodara police and they asked me about one man from karjan town and also other riot victims we had helped in 2002
283546 we have some names of people whose families got wiped out during the riots but weve had no success in tracking them down
283547 the possibility of novices being used to plant bombs makes our job all the more difficult while there are no precise clues it is only natural for us to look at riot survivors because vengeance may have been the motive to join such a terror plot

283549 as has been their hallmark this congress bush mccain republicans have once again run away from an important debate failing to back up their words with action
283550 it is this kind of misplaced priorities that is making america less secure our military readiness is down afghanistan is slipping further into violence pakistan remains in crisis and osama bin laden and ayman al zawahiri are still on the loose nearly seven years after 9 11 the iraq war is not only costly but president bush and john mccain have provided no plan for responsibly ending the war and returning to the fight against al qaeda and the taliban

283562 the reality of the ad which i think ought to be a lesson for mccain right now is that ad helped harold ford absolutely
283563 theres all sorts of white swing voters for whom the idea of sending an attractive young obviously at the beginning of a great career black man up to washington is a very attractive prospect
283564 new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous white women
283565 remember mccain hired the operative who put together the ford bimbo ad
283566 it celebrates the excitement that he has generated that is certainly more akin to the excitement that a celebrity generates than a normal politician
283567 the primary place that that issue exists is around tables like this

283578 si en cambio corregimos con amor restamos j venes en los callejones y los sumamos en las universidades y empresas porque un ni o sin golpes es un ni o con oportunidades y porque un joven sin humillaciones es un joven con metas y sue os propios
283579 el pa s debe concentrarse en promover nuevas formas de educaci n sin violencia ense ando a los padres de familia mecanismos novedosos de aprendizaje orientados al establecimiento de l mites para sus hijos pero para nada se puede justificar los golpes
283580 no creo que venga un proceso de nacionalizaci n de la banca pero ch vez no se detiene en esto los sectores estrat gicos parece que son permeables y podr a buscar empresas de alimentos farmac uticas o de salud
283581 el gobierno ya ven a desarrollando la banca estatal y con la adquisici n de banco de venezuela que tiene un valor estrat gico por su cobertura geogr fica ampl a y consolida su presencia en todo el pa s
283582 es probable que haya m s estatizaciones por ejemplo un claro objetivo del gobierno es tener una red nacional eficiente de distribuci n de alimentos que con sus actuales programas no ha podido cumplir
283583 la expropiaci n se plantea como una participaci n del estado en los sectores productivos con la que la poblaci n m s humilde recibir una mejor atenci n a sus necesidades y eso es mayoritariamente respaldado

283590 incidencia de recusaci n se tramitar por autos separados eso ir a una cortes de apelaciones y se tomar una decisi n la semana que viene
283591 lo importante es que chirinos no tendr que permanecer en la polic a
283592 bajo estas condiciones no necesita una medida de coerci n personal el alegato para detenerlo fue la magnitud de la pena y la gravedad del hecho eso es un punto dentro de los art culos de ley pero afortunadamente ces la detenci n en la polic a y ya est camino a su casa
283593 el tribunal orden el procedimiento ordinario nosotros consideramos que esto es una privaci n de libertad por lo que tienen que aplicarse los lapsos de 45 d as
283594 no le conviene ni al ministerio p blico ni a la defensa ni a la verdad estos lapsos porque estamos hablando de un caso de complejidad nos parece dif cil que un caso as se pueda resolver en 45 d as
283595 lo que nos preocupa que queden aristas por fuera aqu la verdad se tiene que producir y la ciencia forense es la que va a aportarla pero no una investigaci n con carreras sino una investigaci n con la que se produzca realmente lo que necesitamos
283596 no sabemos si hay nuevas actuaciones porque hay una reserva total de actas estamos pidiendo tener acceso para poder preparar la defensa
283597 para ellos temas como el nuclear son pretextos la raz n principal de la hostilidad contra ir n de los enemigos en los ltimos 30 a os es que quieren hacernos retroceder para luego decir que nos obligaron a ceder

283652 the historic event that unfolded today on the floor of the peoples house was about more than gas prices
283653 today house republicans and the american people stood side by side to make history together we sent a powerful message to speaker pelosi senators reid and obama and other top democrats that we will not rest until they allow a vote for more american energy and lower gas prices and we sent a powerful message that the passion to make our voices heard will never be extinguished by the heavy handed actions of the out of touch democratic majority house republicans and the american people showed today that we will stand united together on the most important issue facing our nation and we will fight boldly until congress finally heeds our will

283659 applications in this science are relatively new so we are just now finding out some of the implications
283660 materials made on this very small scale have been found to have very different physical properties from the same substances made in more traditional ways
283661 the goal of this conference is to bring to light what is known about this technology and help inform those who must make decisions about future opportunities and acceptance of nanotechnology

283690 when we grow through m amp as mergers and acquisitions we at time lose out on opportunities that could have been pursued by us had we grown organically
283691 when we were looking at infocrossing it infrastructure outsourcing healthcare and bpo solutions provider we were also looking at some other targets one of them was taken over by patni
283692 we have started tapping opportunities on the middle east which is flush with funds with the realisation that the oil money will not last forever sovereign funds in this region are heavily investing in education electrification healthcare and other infrastructure this has thrown up huge opportunities for us
283693 while they are not price insensitive they are also not overly price sensitive
283694 there is no dearth of skilled workers in the middle east that is because many people who have worked overseas are returning we have an employee who has a phd from the usa in the core team in egypt
283695 everything that is wrong with nacil cannot be blamed on the merger
283696 we would like to clear all this in the next session

283700 the announcement this morning is an incredible boon for job growth and job retention specifically for our region
283701 this commitment will solidify our regions and our states position as being a hotbed for nanotechnology and semiconductor research and the rewards are huge
283702 these new investments will spur continuing advancements in nanotechnology and semiconductor research and development including new efforts in semiconductor packaging propelling ibm chip innovations and solidifying the states reputation as a high technology leader
283703 when the fracture results in nanoplates it leads to a low level of fracture energy at a certain size resulting in a size specific fracture
283704 it also may prove useful in the deliberate creation of large quantities of stable nanostructures
283705 thus the phonon confinement should occur instantaneously as the crack propagates
283706 this could have important consequences not only for small materials but also for the way cracks propagate in nanostructured bulk materials
283707 we expect this to go up to 40 60 for the whole year
283708 we have purchased 19 new cranes in the last quarter at a cost of rs 66 crore this includes nine used and 10 new cranes

283710 our next year capex has also been fixed at rs 250 crore but that may also go up we may then go for equity dilution to meet fund requirements
283711 we plan to incorporate these norms in the development control regulations no mall or multiplex will be issued occupation certificate minus compliance

283924 i found that three or four pages of explanatory text usually are quite well received
283925 it may not be totally acceptable to a few readers but overall most will enjoy learning something new and if the material is adequately condensed and
283926 i was already writing marketing collateral for the company and when we discussed social media marketing in a meeting i explained how the sites worked i spend more time on them than i should i was asked to create a proposal outlining the scope of what i could do on the sites and that was that i landed the contract

283930 macondo is a community of poets novelists journalists performance artists and creative writers of all genres whose work is socially engaged
283931 what unites us is a commitment to serve our underserved communities through our writing
283932 dedicated and compassionate writers who view their work and talents as part of a larger task of community building and nonviolent social change
283933 macondo is a community of poets novelists journalists performance artists and creative writers of all genres whose work is socially engaged
283934 what unites us is a commitment to serve our underserved communities through our writing
283935 nurturing generosity a commitment to the community a strong background of giving back to the community is very important
283936 but we go back into that house to rescue others
283937 a community of people who are not only talented and creative but also generous welcoming and ferociously dedicated to bettering their craft and their communities
283938 macondo reinforces my notion of community and reminds me that i write for something bigger and that i dont do it alone

283942 we need to protect consumers access said fcc chairman kevin martin a republican
283943 while comcast has said it would stop the arbitrary blocking consumers deserve to know that the commitment is backed up by legal enforcement
283944 congress has intentionally refrained from imposing the heavy hand of government which is precisely why we have seen such rapid growth in the internet
283945 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
283946 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
283947 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
283948 but the fight is far from over a duopoly market where phone and cable companies control nearly 99 percent of high speed connections will not discipline itself we look forward to working with the fcc and congress to ensure proactive measures keep the internet open and free of discrimination and accessible to all americans

283980 to recruit to an area where these specialists are among the lowest paid in canada is going to be very difficult under those circumstances
283981 certainly its part of our frustration its not our primary frustration but it certainly doesnt make us feel any better being the lowest paid physicians of our group in the country its just another added low
283982 theyre already a very vulnerable population it was an extremely difficult decision for us to come to and i really hope that we can get it resolved

283993 stamping out bullying is one of the big tests we face in education and its time morris iemma appointed a full time education minister
283994 the government must immediately find the funds for another 700 school counsellors our teachers are doing their best but they are not professionally trained to look out for the warning signs in bullying victims or to change the behaviour of bullies

284088 he was a young man who had recently joined the police guard and he used to visit us i had known him very well

284106 it makes for the weeks to be a little longer it makes for the days to be longer and makes for the games to be a little bit more of a struggle hopefully we can take advantage of it as opposed to suffering through it its going to be pretty hot pretty steamy pretty spicy its a reality
284107 this is nothing new for me but houston in august is very hot its the hottest month in louisiana too theres not much wind the heat just stacks in there with the humidity

284112 weve been successful because we can score from many different positions brad evans can come late in the box its a matter of the guys on the field taking advantage of opportunities garey has done well with his opportunities steve has done well the times hes come in in order to have a successful season we need different players to come in and score goals at key moments
284113 the team looks different but thats why we have 18 guys on the roster and 28 guys on the team because you bring in players you think are good enough to do the job nows their opportunity to step on the field and do the things they know how to do
284114 they should know that we have confidence the coaching staff has confidence that they can do the things we expect them to do
284115 for us its a matter of concentrating or focusing on things that made us successful staying compact defending well fighting for each other pushing each other and trying to make the most of the opportunities we get the most important thing weve done this year is to find a way to get results that would certainly come in handy this weekend

284294 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado

284342 el actual tipo de cambio el boom de la soja y las forestales desplazaron a la ganader a desde el litoral y la pampa hacia esta provincia las empresas donde tambi n est n las mineras intentan por todos los medios apropiarse de tierras y agua comprando fraguando t tulos usurpando y prometiendo un progreso que son mentiras

284344 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales
284345 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
284346 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno
284347 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
284348 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo

284405 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
284406 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisers have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief

284421 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
284422 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
284423 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personal
284424 we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
284425 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations
284426 so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
284427 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man

284445 confidence in the validity of the anglican communion is severely damaged
284446 bishops cannot be a symbol of unity when their consecration itself divided the church

284454 this change begs a few questions is the 64 bit market ready to go mainstream will consumers realize the benefits from larger chips and 4gb or more of memory the answer to both of these questions is yes but a qualified yes preconfigured 64 bit pcs obtained from retailers or pc manufacturers should work quite well this is in stark contrast to the experience of many technology enthusiasts who built their 64 bit pc from scratch and may have had to scour the web looking for drivers so unless you really love to tinker with your pc we suggest you buy a pre built 64 bit pc at retail or directly from a pc manufacturer
284455 in the future we expect both compatibility and performance of 64 bit pcs to continue to improve most hardware devices have 64 bit drivers today and most software products work unmodified because of the 32 bit emulation technology in 64 bit windows vista called wow64 but there are some gaps especially in the long tail of the market but we expect rapid improvement now that 64 bit pcs are getting so popular over time well see more 64 bit optimized programs hit the market which promise dramatic performance and experience improvements

284470 you have huge volumes of these things shipping and people are getting linux they didnt get it because theyre huge believers in open source they got it because it works well thats a tipping point we can build on
284471 a lot of people have been joking about me being the top dog or big boss so i thought id point out that i work for the board of directors 7 volunteer part time directors who are doing a great job of running the gnome foundation my job is to make them and the gnome foundation even more successful
284472 when i first started working i had a boss who said stormy what can i do for you and ive stuck with that every since a managers role is to help people by working for them or with them to get things done these people are working on gnome because theyre passionate about that and im working for them
284473 trust people to do the right thing trust them to have good ideas to want to make the project organization team or company successful trust them they want to do good empower them make sure they know you trust and believe in them and give them what they need to execute on their great ideas maybe its a computer or a person to bounce ideas off of or help convincing others or some space or fun people to work with or a better understanding of what the company is trying to do
284474 its much more that i have to make my own business cards
284475 ive known for a long time that developers like open source software at hewlett packard i got lots of calls from developers who were excited about what they were doing and wanted to open source what they were doing developers just like open source because it works well they get to interact they get recognition at and said they consciously chose open source because it helps them retain developers i think youre starting to see more companies doing that ive talked to a lot of companies that are nobody i can quote for you though
284476 the default desktop for many linux distributions is gnome and a lot of people are using linux on the desktop i recently read a survey that said 46 of all enterprise users use openoffice org thats a good sign that the linux desktop is being used by a huge percentage of enterprise users
284477 at everyone wanted to say hi and show me what theyre working on i met with several hundred people its so much fun to be involved in the community and showing the world im part of the community im excited to be working with sponsors and get enterprises using gnome and helping to build those relationships i get energy from interacting with other people i enjoy talking to people and seeing their excitement

284671 we like a very messy thin roll rolled twice so you see a little above the ankle
284672 because the silhouette sits low on the hips and is cut loose it works on both curvy and straight bodies but the petite or short waisted should opt for a slightly less pegged roll so proportions arent so extreme

284679 we included objects that are meant to give you a sense of the sources of inspiration for these art nouveau designers and jewelers
284680 art nouveau jewelry introduced a new aesthetic and it was avant garde for its time

284718 and at the approach end of runway 36 it used to be hard to tell who was aligned with which runway
284719 controllers can spread out and keep the noise levels down
284720 that improves safety they can speak in a calm voice without having to talk over other controllers around them and that helps everybody stay calm

284722 eaa does a fantastic job of preserving the history of aviation and ensures the future through this important program
284723 there are a lot of threats to general aviation today
284724 eaa young eagles can help us show the value of ga in our communities because of that it becomes even more important to maintain the program and to keep the events going around the country
284725 i didnt come to flying until i was 53 years old
284726 but it has made me feel young and challenged again and given me an opportunity to give back
284727 when i was young i was afraid to fly and i knew that i couldnt have this job without air travel
284728 so i learned to fly fell in love with aviation and now have over 18 000 hours logged
284729 when i was a kid everyone was interested in flying
284730 nowadays programs like this will keep that interest alive and motivate the next generation
284731 cam contract air mail route 18 that ran from chicago to san francisco went right over greenfield iowa
284732 so that is what took me in 1982 to the henry ford museum to look at the airplane
284733 i have a friend in england whose name is pete pavey
284734 his expertise is aircraft archival and research and over a two year period he had accounted for every boeing 40 ever built there were 81 serial numbers
284735 this particular airplane showed up as never having been recovered there were newspaper articles that made me believe that it was still on the mountain i talked to some local people and the legend of the canyonville mail plane was alive and well
284736 i had gone to boeing and they were not able to give me any drawings because of liability issues and concerns but what i did find out is that a set of drawings had been made in the 1960s and given to a guy named bill hill in houston
284737 i ran an ad in trade a plane for a year
284738 so we got this fantastic historic airplane that is hobby rebuildable with a set of drawings and with an engine that is still available
284739 to have this many women who have achieved their dream of flight is just amazing
284740 the pink shirts are great to make the public aware that women can and do fly
284741 money is the root of all evil but its also the root of all fun
284742 youngsters really need to be dedicated to start flying today
284743 we do need to encourage young people to get involved
284744 and what woman doesnt like to get her picture taken
284745 there are only one or two women pilots at my airport we need to get the word out that women can do this they think its really hard but its not
284746 but here you realize there are more at home youre an outsider but here you are part of a group
284747 we have cracked the glass ceiling but we havent broken it yet
284748 women need to know that flying is something they can do
284749 we need to get to girls when they are young if we want more women in aviation
284750 weve got to encourage women to try it theyll know right away if they like it or not
284751 in the 32 years that ive been coming here for at least one week a year this city opens their arms to the people of eaa who come from all over the world
284752 and every one of us feels welcome were happy to be a part of this community that weve all fallen in love with were very honored for this thank you
284753 it really is a wonderful honor for us to receive this award because we think of oshkosh as a symbol for what aviation has been and what aviation will be so thank you oshkosh

284758 both official and public awareness of the priority of importance of air forces in any system of national security
284759 the great strategic fact of our generation is that the united states now possesses live frontiers the frontiers of the air and that the oceans are no longer sure ramparts against attack
284760 i remind all of our citizens that the air power of the nation is essential to the preservation of our liberty and that the continued development of the science of air transportation is vital to the trade and commerce of a peaceful world

284775 because they use tools such as email lists web pages and free software to organize actions share information and coordinate at a distance anti corporate globalization networks have become models for emerging forms of directly democratic politics
284776 these groups dont need complex hierarchical structures to spread their messages or organize actions
284777 through the same types of technologically driven mechanisms protests are now being planned for the democratic and republican conventions so it will be interesting to see what the scope of these protests turns out to be
284778 i had never seen anything like it thousands of protestors in the streets confronting police and tear gas
284779 i knew immediately that i wanted to study this phenomenon
284780 a terrific deeply informed ethnographic account of the origins and activities of the anti corporate globalization movement juris identity is as much that of an activist who happens to be doing first rate anthropology as vice versa and there is much for anthropologists to reflect on in the way this work is set up and narrated through these dual identities

284825 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
284826 we have argued repeatedly that there is no need for federal legislation in this area and todays fcc action proves that point
284827 without making a judgment on the substance of todays ruling it is clear that the federal communication commission is prepared to uphold its broadband principles
284828 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission ftc engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
284829 the once felt urgency for congressional action obviously subsided once fcc chairman kevin martin emerged as a consumers rights advocate
284830 i intend to continue monitoring practices in the industry and pressing for passage of my legislative framework for addressing these issues in the months ahead
284831 the vast majority of network management practices that are being used today will be permissible under the fccs framework
284832 the ones that are problems are ones that are too expansive they target specific protocols and applications even when theres no network congestion but techniques used to identify heavy users and reduce their traffic during peak loads is in principle permissible
284833 were always evaluating our broadband plans and services but have nothing new to announce today regarding our pricing structure
284834 with that said given the usage trends were seeing usage based pricing is one way to deal fairly with internet usage which is very uneven among broadband users
284835 when people make the argument that isps will have to meter traffic its a false choice
284836 going to a tiered model is an economic approach some operators are choosing to go in that direction but there are plenty that can use reasonable network management methods to manage their networks
284837 should do the honourable thing and step down from the board

284848 esta es la primera vez que brasil acepta la uni n entre el calentamiento global y la preservaci n del bosque
284849 durante mucho tiempo brasil se opuso furiosamente a esto insistiendo en que la culpa la ten an los hidrocarburos eso es cierto hist ricamente hablando pero los bosques hoy juegan un papel importante

284851 mccains narrowing lead traces not to any sudden up swelling in support for obama whose support has hovered around 38 percent for the past year and remains at that level today
284852 rather it traces to a decline in support of mccain especially among men registered independents and latinos simultaneously the proportion of voters who are uncommitted rose to 16 percent from only nine this may and ralph nader drew a small but important three percent mostly from mccain
284853 there might be some lack of accurate media reporting we probably need a better communications strategy and more accommodating media coverage

284878 if you dont make the problems public the companies dont fix them and the consumers buy shoddy stuff
284879 the concept of responsible disclosure is well and good for new locks that havent hit the market yet but that doesnt help you when the lock is already embedded in millions of facilities theyre not going to fix them
284880 how does it help the consumer not to tell them that there is a vulnerability
284881 medeco customers have a right to know whether their locks can be compromised
284882 we believe that lock picking obviously is an illicit activity even if its a sport we frown on all of that even if its for fun
284883 as new technologies have become available that is what spurred product innovation and that spurs development of new standards
284884 our responsibility is to make changes when we see a change in the state of the art
284885 everybody has some responsibility to not disclose things that can hurt people and that people dont have power over changing
284886 is it a known vulnerability if people dont know about it
284887 im not sure you need to worry about it unless people are out there demonstrating it and showing how to do it
284888 the assumption is that the criminals dont know about it
284889 criminals know how to pick locks the secrecy just hides the truth from the consumer
284890 the goal is to make security better as soon as its not responsible to do research the bad guys win
284891 the lock picking industry doesnt get this because theyre basically still a guild a secret knowledge kind of field whereas computer security is always built on open knowledge
284892 there have been insecurities discovered by computer people turned locksmiths that have existed for hundreds of years
284893 let them make their security assessments based on how secure they are told the locks are
284894 our responsibility is to make changes when we see a change in the state of the art
284895 ibm report shows that as soon as a vulnerability is disclosed an exploit is made for it some think it s time to rethink that policy
284896 we believe that lock picking obviously is an illicit activity even if its a sport
284897 the industry doesnt need outsiders pointing out flaws with products because there is an established system in place for creating new standards for manufacturers to follow

284909 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
284910 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
284911 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
284912 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
284913 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
284914 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
284915 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
284916 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
284917 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
284918 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
284919 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
284920 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
284921 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
284922 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
284923 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
284924 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
284925 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
284926 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
284927 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
284928 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
284929 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
284930 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
284931 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
284932 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
284933 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
284934 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
284935 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
284936 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
284937 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential

284950 we took this prudent action out of an abundance of caution and our commitment to public safety even though there is no evidence from the child development center that there is an acute health risk related to play on this type of artificial surface
284951 with previous rotations the first time we saw that equipment was when we got to kuwait
284952 there now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
284953 i don t believe they re hard core al qaida
284954 i believe they re just people trying to put food on the table if we can give them a good alternative to terrorism or attacking u s troops one which will help them feed their children and won t get them killed or arrested i think they ll take it
284955 why when they ve seen that the grass is greener would they go back to where it was dead
284956 that s really good that s extremely good that means the iraqi forces are starting to have more of an effect in the anbar province
284957 it means the iraq army and the iraq police and the sons of iraq are all doing their jobs everyone s tired of the insurgency
284958 hes like a gnat that just swarms around your head irritating
284959 the other guys from what ive heard dont really like sergio that much but they love him during the ryder cup

284961 early in the planning stages for the trip to minnesota eric was going to join his brother
284962 however we were simultaneously scheduled to attend a scope review meeting on another project so we diverted eric to attend the meeting in philadelphia with our managing director from germany marc and alan went to viracon
284963 these gentlemen were valued for their camaraderie as well as their professional expertise the loss of their friendship and that of karen sandland of tishman construction will be keenly felt by all of us here
284964 marc was so excited about the trip and the opportunities it presented for our company
284965 he brought us all an energy and vitality to every aspect of his work and to the people here the spark he brought to all of us will be sorely missed
284966 it will take time but we are resolved to keep the projects they dedicated themselves to on target
284967 their work will be a legacy to the kind of people they were dedicated hard working and genuinely two of the best people any of us here at apg international ever had the pleasure of knowing
284968 marc rosenberg was a loving husband father and son who was dedicated beyond words to the people he loved
284969 he will be greatly missed by all who knew him this is a terrible thing that happened and there are many grieving for all those who perished in this accident
284970 this crash serves as a reminder that life is fragile precious and fleeting and we must make the most of the time weve been given
284971 all of new jersey will be keeping the families of those lost in their thoughts and prayers
284972 while our industry is large in some respects those of us who work within the industry either know one another or have very few degrees of separation between us
284973 so this has been a time of shock sadness and reflection for many of us within the industry our sympathy and prayers go out to the family friends and loved ones who have been affected by this tragedy including of course those within the revel organization
284974 it is unacceptable that state property should be attacked in this way particularly when the offices were occupied at the time by sea fishery protection officers who are public servants performing their statutory duties

284983 many analysts and shareholders said dumping most of the brokerages collateralized debt obligations for 22 cents on the dollar was nasty but necessary and could show other wall street firms and commercial banks a way to finally escape the worst of their securities and loans
284984 even in the winter its nice to come for a night or two just to relax use the pool the spa its a great place to eat curl up with a book go for a walk you know its totally cool like that
284985 i had worked for tom for a long time and i was looking for something different you know
284986 it takes me about an hour and 10 minutes driving depending on traffic depending on time of day but it seems like a whole other world like sometimes it would take me an hour to get to seattle from my house even though it was only 23 minutes depending on the day depending if i 5 was backed up
284987 there are certain things we can get out here that you probably cant get as easily in seattle like when they open up for hood canal prawns so theyre a little easier to get that might not be as easy in seattle
284988 i feel good doing it i dont know how to describe it but youre on the line cooking and the camaraderie putting things together making it work sending out a great dish just the flow of it you know its what i feel comfortable doing
284989 tailored or facilitated the tailoring of internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use

284991 we look forward to responding promptly to the committees request
284992 a 5100 square foot facility with three 50 inch flat screen tvs an 8 foot projection screen and a professional karaoke unit
284993 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
284994 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
284995 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
284996 once the public got rid of rebecca i knew that i was next
284997 that night when she kissed mo it was as though somebody got a baseball bat and hit my seven stone chest with it i was livid it was like losing a limb ive never felt that emotional in my entire life
284998 i didnt think i would fancy somebody like rebecca to kiss a woman who smoked a cigarette and supplied herself with booze what was i doing i was intoxicated with the fumes i do fancy rebecca id like to think she fancies me ok magazine will tell you i suppose
284999 what was i supposed to do argue no i slagged them off it was entertaining
285000 shes a drama queen and a gimmick she stages everything shes a very clever woman and she isnt as soft as she makes out
285001 no davina no it will shut him up but it will be sickening it will be precious princess this and precious princess that
285002 it was an inexplainable experience i got more than i bargained for and it was one of the best times in my entire life
285003 picking one single person from all of russian history to represent it to give it a face and yes a name
285004 the tsar currently leads stalin 267 000 to 263 000 out of nearly 2 4 million votes cast overall
285005 we just came from the go team and it was really cool
285006 i like to hear everything the headliners get people out but the other side is coming out and checking out new stuff
285007 we mainly made the trip for rage against the machine
285008 she stayed on the surface and didnt go down too deep so that was a lucky break for him
285009 and the summers have always been kind of the time where i catch fire and im just not used to playing like ive been playing during my season this is when it gets hot and courses start playing tough and i play well at courses like this
285010 its very frustrating because i worked harder probably three times as hard as ive worked in my entire life this year that was one of the main goals that my caddy and i had we said were going to have a good attitude and just work our tails off this year and see where it takes us
285011 hes got a lot of good stuff to say and approaches things a little bit different
285012 he saw some things in my setup and my move to my left side with kind of my legwork and basically its taken the left side of the golf course out of play and thats kind of been my nemesis this year
285013 im not hitting enough fairways and greens and whenever i do ive got a 40 foot putt for birdie
285014 so obviously the ball striking really needed to improve and i literally spent i dont know 30 minutes on the range with sean and it was immediate
285015 sometimes you just look at it and work with somebody for such a long time that its kind of hard to see things and i think that was maybe the case with steve and i and it just worked out that i picked the right guy to work with and i think were making some nice headway
285016 i think i still had my foot on the gas a little too much and when i let the clutch out it spun the wheels
285017 i got out of the car i was freaking out i kind of was like im okay im okay ill be all right for the u s open
285018 and after i said that my neck started hurting my chest started hurting and then i went to the hospital
285019 i am taking away a lot of good things from this week
285020 i made some really good putts some really good drives i know that there are some things i need to work on but i feel like i learned a lot
285021 i think if i played a couple in a row itd be a different story but its hard to play one a year you know
285022 the usga put some pin placements on us today that almost defy the imagination you know its just treacherous treacherous greens out there with some unbelievable pin placements today
285023 its going to be fun watching on tv im glad im finished
285024 im pleased with where i am i felt like i played a little better eight and nine kind of leaves a little bad taste in your mouth im trying to wash it down with diet coke but its not helping a whole lot right now
285025 my fourth shot was not quite as difficult as the third one but it was a really difficult shot and i was very fortunate the pitch came out nice and gave myself an opportunity
285026 but yeah that was a great up and down very lucky there
285027 usually they tend to go with smaller greens tighter fairways these greens are big but you better put it in the proper section of those greens
285028 so this is a little bit different than their normal usual usga setup but it doesnt make it any less difficult
285029 the altitude makes club selection a guessing game and that cheyenne mountain makes reading putts a little bit of a guessing game
285030 obviously you have to be hitting the ball well and you have to be putting it well to get it into good position through two rounds youre going to have to continue to do that
285031 but then a lot of it is choosing the right club getting it in a position where you have a chance to make a putt
285032 the golf course like i said is tough and to be under par for two rounds im in good position
285033 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
285034 were out to kill you were out to kill your babies
285035 griff is widely known for his nostalgic paintings of sc wildlife dogs charleston floral nautical scenes and golf which has ultimately become the foundation of his reputation as a realist painter his love of golf finally spilled over to the canvas and it was from that point that it became apparent griff had launched an artistic pattern of his own

285050 although the rule of law is an initiation of political leaders like me it is also a vital component for political success as it ensures an orderly society
285051 it upholds the independence of the judiciary and at the same time upholds fairness of the courts
285052 this is because of the bureaucracy involved the law comes first change may be quicker if it was not the law standing in the way in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks we decided to enact anti terrorism laws but some of these laws ran smack against human rights values like it was against human rights to prosecute someone forcibly
285053 but we could not prove beyond reasonable doubt the house of lords were adamant on this but we could not allow these suspected terrorist to walk the streets the house of lords wanted these suspects convicted beyond reasonable doubt but then terror struck more than 10 people were killed
285054 judges too have a role to play they must also follow the law they should never be tainted with corruption the publics confidence in the judiciary must be upheld at all times
285055 a delay in justice or justice only for the rich
285056 i feel that the rule of law is necessary to ensure a stable and good government it is necessary to ensure a peaceful modern nation which can strive attracting investors who do not fear that their investment could be wiped out by a single law suit of a powerful person of the nation

285088 theyre marketing their services to not only foreign governments but to fortune 500 corporations
285089 this is a company that has been accused of murdering iraqi civilians
285090 of shooting the bodyguard to the iraqi vice president of causing blowback attacks on united states troops of hurting the morale of the united states military that has cost united states taxpayers over a billion dollars for its operations in iraq
285091 a private cia essentially called total intelligence solutions and the man running total intelligence solutions is j cofer black hes a thirty year veteran of the central intelligence agency he also was the guy who ran the cias extraordinary rendition program the government sanctioned kidnap and torture program
285092 his thirty year cia career his network of contacts his knowledge that was gained through his work in the most sensitive areas of the united states government is now on the open market for hire
285093 you have a lot of traditional conservatives who are outraged at what they see as the degradation of the united states armed forces this has everything to do with the future of war making and global stability
285094 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken

285100 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton

285115 the first is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
285116 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
285117 such a deal would have been immoral and unethical it obviously didnt happen
285118 it then became clear to me that i could not come before the tribunal
285119 he continued to live the lifestyle of a grad student no frills
285120 were looking at a man with a distinguished 30 something year career unparalleled and known around the world
285121 his career and his reputation are trashed and the fbi still hasnt said what they have on him
285122 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
285123 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
285124 we knew they were looking at someone we knew that bruce worked at fort detrick we knew he worked with pathogens

285129 the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together
285130 that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
285131 the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic cannot stand the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
285132 we have made it clear we are looking for a clean unconditional exception

285134 we have been consistent looking forward we need the exemption to resume full nuclear cooperation with the world

285254 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
285255 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
285256 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
285257 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
285258 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
285259 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
285260 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
285261 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
285262 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
285263 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
285264 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
285265 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
285266 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
285267 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
285268 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
285269 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
285270 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today

285277 neither cond nast publications nor the articles author intended to imply that they had concluded that steven j hatfill m d perpetrated the anthrax attacks that occurred in the united states in the fall of 2001 to the extent any statements contained in the article might be read to convey that cond nast and prof foster were accusing dr hatfill of perpetrating these attacks cond nast and prof foster retract any such implication

285285 the new sunset gardens residence will offer a great service to the community by providing seniors with the opportunity to live safely and independently if there is a challenge today for new york city and our nation it is a shortage of affordable housing particularly for seniors i would like to thank lutheran healthcare for stepping up and providing not only wellness services but a supportive community oriented environment for our seniors to live
285286 its abundantly apparent that the need for subsidized senior housing overwhelmingly exceeds the availability of affordable units in brooklyn
285287 we are very pleased to have received broad community support for this housing initiative
285288 with our world class museums restaurants and cultural attractions there isnt a better place in the world than brooklyn for people to spend their golden years but since many seniors are on a fixed income the realities of the new york real estate market make it difficult for them to find housing here uniquely tailored to their needs

285407 nasa should be at the forefront in the collection of scientific evidence and debunking the current hysteria over human caused
285408 james hansen is a political activist who spreads fear even when nasas own data contradict him
285409 man i feel like shit wonder if im jet lagged
285410 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
285411 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
285412 pre asnom i presvetom bratu na em ivanu nadbiskupu svete crkve salonitanske i svima sufraganima
285413 u vrijeme presvetog pape ivana dok je u pokrajini hrvata i u krajevima dalmacije bio konzul kralj tomislav
285414 koji boravi u slavoniji i dalmaciji predragim na im sinovima
285415 u ono dakle vrijeme isti bugari provali e u hrvatsku s naoru anom etom alogoboturovom
285416 kr tena hrvatska postavlja do 60000 konjani tva a do 100000 pje a tva i sagena do 80 i kondura do 100
285417 simeon vladar bugarske uputi vojsku na hrvate i zametnuv i s njima bitku pora en posvema izgubi sve svoje ete
285418 umjesto njega vladao je njegov brat tomislav koji je bio sna an ali ne tako kao njegov brat za tomislavova vladanja pokrene kralj ugra imenom atila vojsku da ga svlada ali je kralj tomislav hrabar mladi i sna an ratnik vodio s njime mnogo ratova i uvijek ga je natjerao u bijeg i rodi tomislav sinove i k eri i trinaeste godine svoga kraljevanja umre
285419 vidimo tomislava sred priestolnice biograda gdje ga je odabrana kita velmo a hrvatskih obkru ila kako mu dvorski astnici pru aju ezlo i ma

285422 its okay im covered under the galactic healthcare plan right
285423 basta me pensar enquanto faco a lida da casa por exemplo
285424 you just broke some kids leg and you want to see a movie
285425 bunny outfit oh yeah i wore that to lindsays party the other week the one where we totally got trashed and sarah puked in the taxi and then p herself in the street the outfit is still alright though sweetie bit smoky second draw down
285426 god you look just like your mother there with that sneery look on your face
285427 im getting a lot more confident because i didnt have such a good school ball season
285428 i felt like i struggled at the world series and it kind of carried over
285429 no one really knew about the hamstring injury i didnt want to you know publicize it and i didnt want to rush back
285430 i changed my delivery a little bit and i was really inconsistent i just needed to compete that much harder as soon as summer league started ive gotten more and more confidence
285431 he is a proven pitcher and hes had a lot of success
285432 this spring he didnt have the season he would have liked but its been fun this summer to see him work through all that
285433 he pitches usually one game a week but hes always working always finding something to do he does the work you need to be a high level pitcher hes become that dominant the last two or three starts hes been great
285434 i know they beat longview red lion twice to win their super regional
285435 were all pretty excited the pressure is kind of off
285436 we have a lot of confidence from the season because so many of the guys have played for state championships
285437 they know what it means to go all the way
285438 we all committed to coming back and taking another crack at it
285439 it helped us get ready and it helped bring us all together as a team
285440 it means we were successful if we didnt win regionals it wouldnt have felt like we accomplished everything we wanted
285441 it was like oh no here comes a repeat to all that disappointment
285442 then the next guy got out and my heart just dropped but cody mason came up clutch and got a base hit allowing me to score the tying run
285443 two years ago we lost to lynden in the state championship game
285444 last year it was the regional semifinals every year theres been a hump for us to get over i think weve become a bit more of a clutch team we know how to finish games now and we trust that our teammates are going to come up with a big hit or whatever we need to win
285445 i think it showed these guys what hard work and committing yourself to a goal can do
285446 we worked real hard to get here during the offseason and we played 64 games to prepare if we had lost it would have hurt but i think we would have been satisfied because we gave it all we had and just came up short
285447 we know theres going to be some pretty high quality teams at the zone tournament
285448 some of the best teams in the country were excited to play them and see if we can hang with them and get some wins and maybe go to the world series
285449 one night at practice we were focusing on pitching and everybody was there so i just decided to teach them all
285450 now our biggest challenge is getting everybody a chance to pitch but it usually means were sending out somebody who is fresh and has their best stuff
285451 quando estamos sentados com tr s amigos a jogar e entra uma smash ball em campo o momento mais pico de todo o jogo
285452 we stood by looking at the different kinds of snails nearby a trash can people were amazed at how many species there were we continued walking and we saw different species of frogs named coquis different sized spiders grabbing food from their webs a few glow worms flying around a big frog lizards sleeping on trees or leaves and heard an owl the highlight of the night was when we found a snake a boa puertorrique a which is an endangered species of puerto rico at this point everyone was really excited we learned a few facts like her weight age and length after taking pictures and observing the boa she was returned to the wild and we went home happy
285453 because we need to create a sense of consciences we are running out of time we need to take immediately action
285454 because we need to protect nature it is indispensable to our existence
285455 thats what it was i was attracted to him because he was always so well groomed for being a runaway
285456 write about the god you do believe in and the god you would like to believe in
285457 recovering a sense of integrity week 4 of the artists way
285458 this announcement by the mayor is a major development and almost a sure indication that the incinerator will close
285459 its time to retire this dinosaur of a technology that has polluted our city and planet for far too long
285460 we are gathering today to say that incineration is a major liability in the context of climate change
285461 anna hung tough on this issue and cultivated the stakeholders needed to build a broad based coalition of community activists environmental experts and sympathetic elected officials
285462 and eds efforts over the years have resulted in the toppling of one incinerator after another
285463 were seeing the problem pop up in classrooms rvs other kinds of manufactured housing and conventional homes that use cheap particle board cabinets or carpeting containing formaldehyde so this decision is a no brainer
285464 everybody loved the design with owensboro identified in the context of the western hemisphere
285465 now nearly the entire school staff has bought the shirt for themselves their class or their own kids
285466 the sierra club is excited about working with the steelworkers because we know that we now have to work together to address the challenges of climate control
285467 this blue green alliance walk is more than good steps in the right direction to raise awareness of global warming issues
285468 it shows that workers and environmentalists share the knowledge that action in addressing climate change issues will be a boost to the economy we are working together to move to a greener and healthier economy for the future
285469 we received so much support from total strangers who appreciated us standing up for something we believed in
285470 this will back up the burgeoning wind investments that are booming all across the state thanks to our recent success in enacting a
285471 credit goes to the chapters clean air amp renewable energy committee and their partners at clean energy now
285472 well be rotating passengers and blogging about the trip the whole way
285473 and well also be interviewing young eco entrepreneurs en route who are making a difference with creative business art and non profit business solutions
285474 the leadership provided by grassroots leaders like kathy larry and pete has inspired support and participation from others throughout the state
285475 there is a broad coalition of organizations that are involved that appreciate the environmental justice implications of mountaintop removal mining and of new coal plants
285476 weve all come together to stop this power plant and to get a miles worth of petitions
285477 its a great example of people who are affected by the different stages of the dirty coal cycle becoming one voice to stop the destruction of the health and environment of virginia
285478 good now get your ass out of the car and open my door
285479 you have to beg me to do it get on your hands and knees and beg me like a dog

285482 led r cklicht display ausgestattet sein welches ein seitenverh ltnis von 16 9 hat
285483 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
285484 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills
285485 in denver it was a festive outdoor affair in atlanta and palo alto they were quieter gatherings of half a dozen people in a small living room in austin folks packed the city council chambers while up the road in dallas they mingled in a caf
285486 the success of these parties just proves to me that people are interested in hearing about solutions to high gas prices and the continued addiction to oil evidenced in the bush administration
285487 people want to get out and talk with their friends and neighbors about what changes in leadership need to occur this year to move us towards a new energy economy
285488 these house parties gave them that opportunity mixed in with a little social fun too we ate we laughed we talked and we came away with plans before the night was through this was a great way to spend a summer evening
285489 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
285490 they cleaned out their desks were paying them for the month they cleaned them out and they leave today
285491 you cant really predict it but you just hope we dont have to do anymore
285492 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
285493 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
285494 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
285495 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since
285496 nobody in the history of the world has ever even conceived of making this much less actually made it
285497 im like a nail stuck in the wrist of their christmas

285509 we had an altercation that will be dealt with internally
285510 that will be all i will comment on at this time i think any time something like that happens you are obviously disappointed its part of football and you deal with it
285511 usually pertussis outbreaks are tedious and hard to control unfortunately people when theyre the most contagious often take it as a common cold
285512 its very difficult to control the cough it is a severe illness its not like a common cold
285513 its like a brush fire it keeps going and going
285514 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is
285515 cuando los romanos conquistaron iberia muchos it licos fueron a las minas y obtuvieron enormes riquezas compraban un gran n mero de esclavos que entregaban a los encargados de las minas los propietarios de las minas de hispania consiguieron grandes riquezas como ellos esperaban los mineros extraen fortunas incre bles para sus amos mientras que ellos mismos agonizan trabajando d a y noche y muriendo a menudo a causa de tantas penalidades para ellos no existe descanso o tregua en el trabajo al contrario pierden la vida quedando forzados a soportar la fatiga inhumana bajo los golpes de los capataces y aun aquellos que sobreviven gracias a la fuerza de su cuerpo y a la energ a de su esp ritu no alcanzan otra cosa que la miseria eterna para ellos es mejor la muerte que una vida tan penosa
285516 everything is gone i have to basically start over again
285517 my whole living room set couch love seat chair pictures clock and even the speakers for the surround sound
285518 they took all of my childrens school supplies that i had just bought them for school it was devastating
285519 theyve taken everything but whats left in here they took all the juices and sodas and apples
285520 we have to change how we do business with our tax code we need to revamp our energy policy in a fundamental way we need to do something and about our health care system
285521 youll have a chance to ask your question you dont want to disrupt the whole meeting just be courteous thats all
285522 we need better oversight and regulation of the housing market
285523 were finding a lot of houses where people actually get up and walk away
285524 unfortunately this is how we find most of them with the ac units already snatched out of them
285525 he will get a bill for us having to secure it hell also get one for high grass and weeds and to clear up the property
285526 i go through one week and the next week i see two vacant houses the next week maybe four houses pretty soon there are only one or two people staying on the street
285527 when people pull up the first thing people look at is the outside the grass
285528 if the grass is cut on a consistent basis people will think twice about going up to the front door or doing whatever they do
285529 we are outraged to hear this its a financial detriment to all the businesses along this drive
285530 it is the responsibility of the property tenants to change the addressing with utilities clients publications etc
285531 we quickly came up that its going to cost thousands of dollars to make this change
285532 whereas ralph buckner jr has advised city council member bambi hines that he has consulted with the businesses currently located on commerce drive and those businesses do not object to the renaming of commerce drive to ralph buckner boulevard
285533 i think its a total lack of due process a callous disregard on the part of the city council that they accepted representation of a council member who said none of the people along this drive had objected
285534 we were never contacted and we object to any such name change
285535 we have approximately 50 people on staff with business cards letterhead and many printed materials
285536 the state does not have the funds to make all address changes neither do we have the time or staff to notify all clients and vendors
285537 that is not the truth we were never contacted is mr buckner willing to pay for all expenses incurred with the name change
285538 i personally went to each of the businesses on the drive there are five businesses and offices including mine and none of them had known about this
285539 at this point i think it needs to be rescinded
285540 the signs changed so anyone who comes looking for me on commerce drive that does not know where commerce drive used to be theyre not going to find me
285541 i am shocked that anyone is opposed to the renaming of this street ralph buckner sr did so much for the community

285612 he is the consummate professional and we wish him well with this move to chivas usa this is an opportunity for zach to compete for a starting role and we did not want to stand in his way
285613 the himalayan nation of nepal has become the worlds newest republic ending 240 years of monarchy

285615 a team of physicists has claimed that our view of the early universe may contain the signature of a time before the big bang
285616 are we living in the last century of our civilization is it possible that all of our technology knowledge and wealth cannot save us from ourselves could our society actually be heading towards collapse
285617 an ancient military industrial complex a society that was organized down to the very last detail for the production of weapons to be used in conquering enemies of the empire
285618 he was never really an anonymous sperm donor he always was present in the childrens lives
285619 kind of a smooth and what i would consider a supportive relationship in terms of the kids
285620 and he wasnt interested in the accompanying responsibility to provide financial support for the kids
285621 the credit crunch today is not destroying capital but recognising that capital was destroyed by misallocation in the years of irrational exuberance
285622 im in favor of solving problems what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
285623 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
285624 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
285625 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
285626 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
285627 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
285628 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates
285629 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
285630 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
285631 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
285632 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
285633 die gegend ist eine kriegszone wir verlangen dort eine waffenruhe damit wir sie freilassen k nnen

285636 the unimpeded dissemination of literature and comprehensive information on bulgaria and on the unity of the macedonians who have no hesitation in calling themselves bulgarians
285637 they claim that the term macedonian nation was invented by tito whereas we know that the term macedonians was used by our ancestors despite all the misleading propaganda they were bombarded with

285640 the most encouraging thing is she has been listened to
285641 i think theres a recognition she has a lot of supporters out there and they need to reach out as shes reaching out to him obama
285642 weve worked together and there are a number of clinton supporters on the platform committee itself

285644 my daughter has asthma my son has asthma and my oldest boy has asthma and he also has seizures
285645 always put everything in writing to the adjuster because if you start documenting what your claim is the insurance companies feel compelled to properly evaluate the loss
285646 these lawsuits arose from claims that were adjusted over four years ago and the suits were the first notice that the company received that there was any disagreement over the amounts paid on the claims while we believe the claims were handled properly we opted to use the appraisal process provided for in the policies in order to amicably and quickly resolve the disputes knowing that having the appraisals take place almost 4 years after the storm would make them difficult and involve a lot of guesswork though we feel the amounts awarded in many of the appraisals are inflated and suspect that the appraisers erred on the side of including damage that was due to wear and tear this is a process we agreed to and accordingly the company has paid the awards in order to bring this matter to a final conclusion
285647 i dont see how someone could come in and take somebodys whole house and walk away with it without being seen
285648 a chair two end tables with lamps and a middle table here mirrors on the wall here they took it all
285649 this room is my younger two daughters room where it just looks like they came in here and trashed it and threw stuff around
285650 they cleaned out their desks were paying them for the month they cleaned them out and they leave today
285651 you cant really predict it but you just hope we dont have to do anymore
285652 they have never been properly reproduced but weve recovered the original information that was there
285653 if you put headphones on with those recordings you are right in the middle of the room you hear the whole ambience
285654 i think what weve got is what they were listening to at the time

285657 the scions of lancaster massachusetts a village they had largely dominated first theologically then financially since the early nineteenth century
285658 best known as our countrys first chief justice of the supreme court
285659 he was also president of the second continental congress secretary of foreign affairs of the confederation and governor of the state of new york
285660 the only cabinet minister in neville chamberlains government to resign over the munich pact of 1938
285661 that he had been something of a war hero that he was a man of affairs in every sense of the word that he published a book on shakespeare and a book of poetry that he seems to have had a lonely childhood but blossomed in school at eton and oxford that he was a close friend to many great men of the day including winston churchill and herbert h asquith that his grandfather a nephew and his wife were also illegitimate like me and that he was a remarkable rogue at least in terms of social propriety
285662 one thing followed another as it always seems to have done with cooper whose looks were not unduly arresting but whose attraction to women apparently was irresistible
285663 why couldnt i tell her that in some ways she was a success
285664 but that she had never been a good mother to me
285665 the most compelling forces in my mothers life evolved from a powerful brew of ambition and duty she needed to be in control but was instinctively drawn to men in power
285666 my mother was not a woman who was easy to genuinely please i felt this from as early on as i can remember perhaps the best gift i gave her was a new red camaro in the 1960s that had a powerful engine it was the only present she ever thanked me for more than twice
285667 i wanted her to know how far apart we were how totally disconnected i felt from her
285668 but it was not my mothers fame that kept us apart when i visited her from maine she met me in her red room cigarette and drink in hand struggling heroically to find a connection she certainly knew how to look like she was listening but the little gushes of flattery gave her away they landed on me like raindrops familiar and haphazard reminding me that i was as invisible as ever even the handwritten notes she would leave on the stair landing thanking me for coming to see her felt like sad little life buoys flung out to a departing ship
285669 the story of a rarified world that seems far away today
285670 nee ik heb het n keer geprobeerd en dat is genoeg
285671 we have bids coming in on future property rates specifically for the meetings that the planners are trying to contract for
285672 i can tell you where the rates are headed in miami for upscale full service properties in the south beach area for february 09
285673 i can tell you exactly what the rates are doing if theyre increasing if theyre decreasing and how they compare to different tiers of properties in different cities
285674 well have canned cities and data points ready to go for the most frequently used cities and properties
285675 we can help our buyers understand what the going market rates are in different cities across the world
285676 we can help hotels understand their own markets and the pricing of their competitive sets
285677 having that additional intelligence will allow me to make better business decisions
285678 anytime additional tools are given to me that allow me to make better business decisions it is a good thing
285679 to see all upper upscales in the city of boston it could be 17 or 20 hotels
285680 its not going to really give me a lot of good indication to whats going on especially in a city where the hotel buckets are spread out so far
285681 this is the first analysis on what bids come back
285682 well dig into all kinds of things number of attendees the average amount spent per attendee industry peers
285683 having another source of data will only make us more intelligent as we go forward
285684 we all know that our average costs are going up but many times its hard to justify that with leadership unless you can show them external data that proves that no matter how many meetings you have to place in a particular property or city sometimes the costs are just going to be higher
285685 it can certainly lead to broader negotiations or faster negotiations i have valuable unbiased data right in front of me telling me what the market is bearing right now
285686 the transparency of data is a good idea the more open the data is about what people are actually charging the more it tends to drive the price down transparency tends to reduce that friction so to speak of what happens when you have closed communication loops
285687 in many ways its preconfigured so there are fewer choices for companies to make when theyre rolling out the software
285688 its an inexpensive easy to use platform intended to provide just the essential tools required for meetings management
285689 our strategy will not be a major shift but fine tuning what were already on the path of
285690 our perception and the research weve done on our customers is in many cases were used at a large company that has many large meetings but there are other areas of that company we havent gotten to

285694 the guy who helped facilitate coming to a decision was nick johnson a true unsung hero
285695 all of us in our nasa family are proud of nick johnson and the contributions he made to the successful satellite interception
285696 nick is considered our foremost orbital debris expert and his expertise was instrumental in the decision and successful execution of this difficult mission
285697 in our business its my daughter in law montgomery sapone who does all the analytic reports forecasting and white papers

285722 he spends an awful lot of time talking about me i havent seen an ad yet where he talks about what hes going to do because those folks know they dont have any good answers
285723 trying to make you the us voter scared of me
285724 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
285725 hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
285726 it celebrates the excitement that he has generated that is certainly more akin to the excitement that a celebrity generates than a normal politician
285727 the mccain campaign has very clearly decided that the only way to win this election is to become very personal and very negative
285728 we believe that people will see that as nothing more than the same old politics and the same old policies of the last eight years
285729 its been good for mccain in that he has captured part of the public discourse about obama and at this point thats what he needs
285730 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
285731 it was only through an innovative use of two small relatively unknown telescopes in space and a telescope in arizona that we were able to discover and follow this stars recovery so accurately
285732 i am as constant as the northern star of whose and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament
285733 one hundred years ago polaris varied by 10 but over the last century the variations became smaller and smaller until ten years ago it only varied by 2
285734 it was thought the structure of the star was changing to switch off the vibration yet the team has found that about ten years ago the vibrations started picking up and are now back up at the 4 level
285735 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
285736 they dont care they put on a uniform and they say honor and integrity and they have no morals no honor and no integrity and i dont even know how to sleep at night
285737 shes right handed and the bullet hole was on the left side of her head
285738 lavenas death is part of a disturbing pattern of cases where female soldiers have been raped and killed and where the military has hidden the truth and labeled the deaths suicides in virtually all cases congress has been slow to investigate or hold the military accountable in any way unfortunately most families simply dont have the resources time and psychological strength to push back
285739 this is how they treat a family of a high profile individual
285740 you know i immediately get the news the second anything happens i read it and had to sit down and kind of breathe a little bit
285741 the media drove me crazy that day wanting comments and i didnt want to give any more attention to that jerk
285742 i kind of took the high road and kept talking about healing prevention
285743 and if he would like he can join me in the ring sometime on the wwe ill show you what i really think
285744 how did this partnership come about other than you wanted a hot girl at the wwe
285745 jennys got a great cause we can provide a bunch of eyes and ears a bunch of people that might not know the ins and outs of autism
285746 i think a great way for an apology is to be sat down and educated about it
285747 id love to just quietly sit down with him and educate him on the facts it was clear he doesnt know anything about autism

285752 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
285753 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
285754 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
285755 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
285756 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
285757 dont forget just as 48 has risen theres someone else whos going to rise before chase time
285758 chinas door will always be open during and after the olympics we welcome foreign journalists and will facilitate them in the future
285759 all foreign journalists should abide by chinese rules and regulations and be fair in their reporting on china so we can have good communications with the rest of the world
285760 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
285761 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
285762 families should come away without a feeling of right or wrong but instead with ideas of ways science and technology can help us in the future
285763 the whole thing has a kind of do it yourself feel
285764 i havent come across an issue with such a global importance other than climate change
285765 if the planet gets hotter by only two degrees it will have a very real problem indeed

285769 there was never a deal put on the table that was compelling enough that we as the board could look the shareholders in the eyes and say this is a good deal for you
285770 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
285771 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
285772 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
285773 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
285774 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest
285775 wij nemen radicale stappen om gm te saneren en zulke stappen kosten geld maar dit verlies is dus in feite een investering in de sanering van het bedrijf die de toekomst van gm garandeert

285779 my favorite line came from a guy in a bar go figure but when another guy kept hitting on me and this guy could see i was trying to get rid of him he told him
285780 i cant believe my child just did that in public
285781 the average adult laughs 15 times a day the average child more than 400 times
285782 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
285783 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story

285785 kind of a smooth and what i would consider a supportive relationship in terms of the kids
285786 and he wasnt interested in the accompanying responsibility to provide financial support for the kids
285787 i was pushing just to get the dog back and for the case to be dismissed
285788 we want them to admit they were wrong that they arrested kylea for stealing her own dog that the ownership of the dog is not in question here
285789 we have tape to prove it we have papers to prove it we have tags to prove it
285790 they need to give my daughter her money back and then they can have back the dog

285806 as for me holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal and that i should understand that there would be very sharp rhetoric against me so that my followers would not hamper the implementation of the dayton agreement
285807 there cannot be any regularity in this because i do not know how long the arm of holbrooke or albright is or of anyone from that team or whether that arm can reach me here
285808 i was kept in an unknown place my rights were not told to me i had no right to telephone or even to a text message
285809 what help can he give me what help is he talking about
285810 dont make a statement at a press conference then try to call everybody and say oh we want to work with you state police have no money they are being cut
285811 he had a tough budget we all had tough budgets everybody has a tough budget he had to set priorities ok then he set his priorities but he cant help anyone this whole idea of sending the state police out there what was it for
285812 gt if you use one of these you will need to either enclose it in quotes or escape it with a backslash to prevent the shell from interpreting the character
285813 though press accounts downplayed it the 2002 shooting at appalachian law school was stopped when a student retrieved a gun from his car and confronted the shooter likewise pearl miss school shooter luke woodham was stopped when the schools vice principal took a 45 from his truck and ran to the scene

285838 his career and his reputation are trashed and the fbi still hasnt said what they have on him
285839 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
285840 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
285841 we knew they were looking at someone we knew that bruce worked at fort detrick we knew he worked with pathogens
285842 its not like you might say the person gave off vibes that they might be a dangerous person
285843 george clooney is a rich guy who doesnt hold the slightest clue about how average americans go about their daily lives
285844 now sean penn can say whatever he wants and we invite him on this program to sit in the hot seat and defend his outlandish comments but the real question is who does this guy speak for who does he represent other than other bad actors
285845 if you scratch the surface of barbra streisands or susan sarandons views there is little inner core to them the biggest echo chamber around is the hollywood echo chamber
285846 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices obama said
285847 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done obama said
285848 h e told the post he would be open to expanding the current drilling boundaries if it meant winning approval for more fuel efficient cars developing alternative energy sources and making the country more energy independent
285849 spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
285850 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
285851 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
285852 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
285853 were going to see a lot of very large franchise games come from third parties

285855 we look forward to responding promptly to the committees request
285856 were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer then a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer without going into all the details the kiss was more than just friends they seemed like something more going on and were very affectionate with each other
285857 the kiss made it seem as if they were more than just friends it seemed like something more was going on and they were very affectionate with each other
285858 were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer then a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer without going into all the details the kiss was more than just friends they seemed like something more going on and were very affectionate with each other
285859 the kiss made it seem as if they were more than just friends it seemed like something more was going on and they were very affectionate with each other
285860 it is a severe worry for us i have already heard a rumour that one athlete is going to another club
285861 i am not saying it will happen we should be ok for now as it is nearly the end of the season we dont know how it will pan out
285862 from a marketing standpoint people have to really go back to what is important and thats the audience
285863 creating word of mouth is bigger than just placing something on youtube
285864 fans need to be talking about our shows all the time
285865 we try to do anything that we can to introduce people to the concept of the show and the characters
285866 while we are still driving our team to achieve these targets we believe it is prudent at this time to modify our 2008 operating margin guidance
285867 developing nuclear fuel cycle technology is essential to ensure that the united states can continue to rely on safe and secure nuclear power to meet our energy needs while also addressing nuclear waste and proliferation concerns
285868 business is down in all our major markets and across all product lines as the semiconductor industry works to resolve an excess capacity condition while facing increased headwinds from poor macroeconomic conditions and diminished end user demand
285869 the outlook for near term recovery in orders is muted although we expect some pockets of strength among our large customers as they invest in development at advanced design rules the global economic weakness continues to dampen end user demand for high tech products and we remain cautious in our expectations for a broad based recovery in the second half
285870 with share losses swirling we see service as the only discernible secular growth story but profitability improvement in this business is unclear to us
285871 we believe that it will be difficult for the company to repeat the excellent integration and synergies it accomplished with ade and thermawave due to stricter labor laws in europe moreover the company should face similar issues with proposed acquisition of microelectronic inspection equipment business of vistec semiconductor systems
285872 numbers overall in the security space this quarter and mcafee specifically show the sector is relatively more insulated from macro range softness
285873 is encouraging as we expect consumer revenue to increase significantly
285874 if mcafee can execute well on its consumer and corporate strategy simultaneously we think material upside exists to the stock
285875 the most encouraging thing is she has been listened to
285876 i think theres a recognition she has a lot of supporters out there and they need to reach out as shes reaching out to him obama
285877 weve worked together and there are a number of clinton supporters on the platform committee itself
285878 i remember that moment in the early 70s when paramount offered voight the lead role in
285879 as a young production executive at the studio i was trying to push
285880 he finally blurted the character in this movie is a harvard student he s bright he reads books i could never be believable as that smart young guy
285881 reading voight s op ed piece these many years later i realize how right he was
285882 why dont you stand up and fire back hard at the racially driven attacks
285883 unless it meets the standard of disorderly conduct theres nothing we can do about it
285884 if they turn the music down therell probably not be a ticket issued
285885 weve had several detectives look this case over in the last 27 years they would just go back and look at it with a fresh set of eyes and conduct interviews on anyone that could possibly have any knowledge about the case
285886 they just hit a bunch of brick walls in january a new team of detectives put galloway under surveillance and this thing fell into place
285887 galloway has no idea hes being watched the entire time hes eating
285888 when hes done and gets up to leave they go in the garbage and get the utensils he was eating with thats how they got the dna they needed
285889 there were a lot of resources spent on this case and in the end it really was science teamed up with some outstanding police work that gave us the break in the case
285890 any time you can team those two factors and bring someone to justice and give a family some closure even after 27 years thats what police work is all about

285893 usually pertussis outbreaks are tedious and hard to control unfortunately people when theyre the most contagious often take it as a common cold
285894 its very difficult to control the cough it is a severe illness its not like a common cold
285895 its like a brush fire it keeps going and going

285899 yesterday i drove the ball and couldnt miss a fairway and today i couldnt find one so that was a big difference i felt very comfortable on the tee i just dont know what happened
285900 my iron play was the same i struck them really well and i putted decent
285901 i worked a lot on my putting last week and a few weeks ago and decided im going to stick to a belly putter
285902 ive been going back and forth and couldnt get any consistency out of it
285903 the british open was a turning point where i played really well and putted really badly
285904 i decided thats it im not a good putter with a short putter so thats why ive been playing with a belly and my iron play is really good right now so thats driving me through
285905 i feel much much better with the putter and much better with the wedges
285906 i hit some great wedge shots today just the basic little chip shots that i expect to get close i spent last week on short game exclusively and i feel like its starting to come around

285908 the losing around here stops im tired of it its our fifth year
285909 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
285910 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
285911 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
285912 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
285913 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
285914 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
285915 dont forget just as 48 has risen theres someone else whos going to rise before chase time
285916 he has anointed himself carrying the burden of the one
285917 the car was really comfortable i knew coming to the green that i was going to be in good shape we got the balance right for all three turns and the car was really working great
285918 we had a really good practice session this morning but we felt like could improve the car the guys made some great decisions and it pretty much paid off we really improved on things since last spring and where we are on the racecar i think weve gone in the right direction
285919 i want to give credit to ecr engines great horsepower under the hood its just a real privilege to drive this race car its really fast it was fast last week we couldnt keep the right rear tires on it so maybe this week itll be a different story
285920 the car felt fine in qualifying not knowing how fast we had to drive it because we were pretty bad in practice compared to now and not getting the full effect of what the car really had in it
285921 batman amp robin did so poorly in the box office that warner brothers canceled the fifth batman film
285922 the first is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
285923 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
285924 such a deal would have been immoral and unethical it obviously didnt happen
285925 it then became clear to me that i could not come before the tribunal
285926 in the hope that we may return him to australia so its just comes as a sad note that weve sent him back to a very violent environment and he is now shot dead
285927 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we were a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
285928 the most encouraging thing is she has been listened to
285929 i think theres a recognition she has a lot of supporters out there and they need to reach out as shes reaching out to him obama
285930 weve worked together and there are a number of clinton supporters on the platform committee itself
285931 i will work from the assumption that there might be a retrial and i will assume that it is likely to be in the new year
285932 an essential preparatory step in the plan to bring death and destruction to the heart of the uk
285933 a man in camo clothes appears and shots were fired
285934 the jolie pitt family and getty images have agreed that all proceeds will be used for charitable purposes
285935 i just saw one of the democrats interviewed on television the question was if oil was 10 a gallon and you knew exactly where to get it in alaska or on the coast would you drill there and there was no answer
285936 i am prepared to stay here as long as we can
285937 we dont want to frighten people we want them to take precautions
285938 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
285939 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
285940 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
285941 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
285942 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
285943 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
285944 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
285945 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
285946 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
285947 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
285948 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy
285949 my familys worried ive got alzheimers but i know i havent
285950 the mine generated two explosions that resulted in eight miners being killed
285951 if you are the winning bidder we reserve the right to cancel this auction within the allotted time and will not be held liable for any such cancellation
285952 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
285953 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

285959 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
285960 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
285961 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
285962 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
285963 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
285964 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
285965 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
285966 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
285967 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
285968 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
285969 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
285970 who are open to doing something on the production side
285971 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
285972 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
285973 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
285974 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
285975 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
285976 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
285977 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
285978 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
285979 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
285980 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
285981 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
285982 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
285983 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
285984 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
285985 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
285986 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
285987 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
285988 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
285989 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
285990 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
285991 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
285992 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
285993 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
285994 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
285995 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
285996 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
285997 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
285998 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
285999 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
286000 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
286001 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
286002 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
286003 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
286004 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
286005 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
286006 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
286007 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
286008 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
286009 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
286010 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
286011 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
286012 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
286013 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
286014 the fact that im here has helped me understand many many things
286015 i fell on this site that explained that there were mistakes here in st johns
286016 this is certainly not what we set out to do
286017 we have apologized to the patients for the stress and anxiety that they have gone through and we continue to do that
286018 i dont think that it was racially motivated but i think there are racial overtones to what did happen
286019 i think the incident started with a mistaken identity situation but i think that once it escalated to the point of the beating that there will be racial overtones that come forward remarks that were made insults language that would be racially inflammatory
286020 i just think its so totally out of character for anything like that to have happened here i just could not believe it was true
286021 those actions were so not in keeping with what were known for here
286022 these things do happen bizarre things happen everywhere i think the biggest thing is just the feeling of sadness that that happened to someone
286023 you can find whatever you want in town drugs you name it theyre here
286024 any of these guys who say theres nothing wrong with owen sound theyre crazy or they just dont see it
286025 im realistic enough to know that an incident like this is going to give some people pause but i think that for the most part the people in this community will understand that this is absolutely an unusual incident and not the type of thing that happens on a regular basis in owen sound
286026 what would be very upsetting is that these young hooligans will have changed that for the community and theres no way that they should be allowed that kind of power
286027 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
286028 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
286029 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
286030 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
286031 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
286032 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
286033 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
286034 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
286035 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
286036 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
286037 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
286038 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
286039 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
286040 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
286041 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
286042 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
286043 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
286044 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
286045 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
286046 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
286047 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
286048 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
286049 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
286050 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
286051 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
286052 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
286053 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
286054 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
286055 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
286056 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
286057 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
286058 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
286059 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
286060 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
286061 right now this wireless device p2p activity is not a huge problem
286062 carriers dont have unlimited bandwidth and the number of customers using the internet aggressively will increase
286063 the one reason the internet has grown is that the government has been hands off but they eventually may have to get involved on issues such as p2p file sharing as such activity does impact network and network service to other users
286064 this includes placing restrictions on accessing certain content and applications limiting throughput or the amount of data you can transfer and taking action to optimize or improve the overall use of our network and services
286065 we would review any complaints regarding the network management practices of any internet service providers
286066 they might choose for instance to prioritize voice calls to better manage their networks and ensure critical calls such as those made to 911 for emergencies are not held up in the network
286067 the recently revealed lawsuit that was sheepishly leaked to the press by troyers attorney is an abomination of the legal process

286099 call up the other parents and ask if they have any issues with pedophilia in their house
286100 yes my husband is indeed a pedophile but he only feels the urge every 7 years do you require any other information about our family in that case live long and prosper
286101 do you have any issues with pedophilia in your house
286102 many of us chuckled when he said that but if you did call someone and said that dont you think it would make them think twice about victimizing your child

286110 why what has happened to my little friend raj to turn him away from his only true friend coffee
286111 theyll be a lot more ready this year what we did last year was unbelievable it was a dream come true the only thing id like this year and its not much is just to finish one spot higher
286112 im sure that if id tried to do this in 1998 just after winning the championship it would have been a lot easier
286113 although theres a lot of respect for what ive achieved my oval experience is not huge and even though there was the indy 500 win in 1995 ultimately what people want to know is how youd do in a 36 race season how you do on the ovals and are you still hungry enough to do it
286114 a good showing would help with the sponsors but it wont have any effect on the teams because this is a road course
286115 we had a good race last year but you can tell the level of competition has stepped up
286116 im confident weve got a good crew here and a good car unfortunately most nascar races are like the last two minutes of overtime in hockey it gets out of control if theres a caution with 10 minutes to go cautions breed cautions theres going to be a lot of contact thats what caught us out last year we need to avoid that
286117 he is an amazing road course racer and hes been driving this thing since january
286118 so if he was strong last year he should be even stronger
286119 goodyear brought rain tires but i think theyve been towing them around for six years

286122 my guess is thered be a lot of carnage and you dont want that
286123 when youve got high speed approaches long braking zones and tight corners it makes it very difficult in the wet

286164 aside from the summary for policymakers which is very terse there doesnt exist any vehicle for taking all of the vital information in this lengthy and sometimes very technical set of reports and boiling it down for popular consumption
286165 we wanted to translate the ipcc package in a way that a person on the street without a technical background could really understand the issues involved
286166 we came up with concepts we wanted to explain to a lay audience
286167 such as fingerprint detection how we can look at patterns of temperature change during the 20 th century not just the fact that temperatures are warming but the spatial pattern of warming that points to the source of that warming
286168 we might not be able to tell one from the other if all we had were surface observations but thats not all we have
286169 instead what were finding is a warming in the troposphere the lower part of the atmosphere that we live in but a cooling as you move up into the lower stratosphere where jets fly and that cooling aloft
286170 is a unique signature of a warming due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations
286171 obviously there is some overlap between al gores book and ours
286172 but gores book wasnt written by scientists and it reads like it wasnt while i do think was wonderful
286173 we do think this climate dilemma is something that we can solve
286174 but whats unique about the opportunity at baylor is my tie with coach driscoll who recruited me to play at clemson out of high school
286175 now everybodys upset because they kind of liked to have that freedom to pull in there and thats what they thought thats what they were going to have anyway

286183 another hatfill situation and was he just unable to handle the pressure
286184 from the very beginning there has been speculation that the attacks were carried out by a biodefense zealot who wanted to prove that bioterrorism was a serious problem
286185 it would be unfortunate if the message people take away from this is that the only individuals we should be concerned about are deranged biodefense scientists
286186 we have had a lot of opposition and this is not going to help
286187 sen mccain recently proposed to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent
286188 this would have reduced exxonmobil and conocophillips taxes by 1 2 billion each in 2007 it would have saved chevron 480 million in 2007
286189 the potential for profit encourages people to take risks but without the potential for loss you have reckless risk taking you have risk taking without prudence without the potential for loss irresponsibility goes unpunished
286190 the federal reserve and the treasury department have orchestrated the rescue of bear stearns the defenders of that maneuver argue that if bear stearns had failed it would have created a lot of collateral damage so much collateral damage that you and i normal folk who dont know anything about high falutin financial instruments like collateralized debt obligations would have been engulfed as well if bear stearns had gone bankrupt lehman brothers might have been next

286192 ill admit the technology is amazing but i just couldnt bring myself to buy one
286193 so many people own these phones and are listening to kid rock and snoop doggy doo sic on them now while i wouldnt listen to such trash i know that someone might see me listening to my iphone and say hey look brother hamperton is listening to kid rock i bet i guess i can too i dont want to be a stumbling block were called to be separate you know
286194 i was in the streets with violence promiscuous females and drugs
286195 i used to hang out all day smoke weed and drink

286197 its hard for young people to trust who they dont know but hes made good friends here
286198 when he first got here he wasnt making very good decisions now hes making better ones
286199 they encouraged me to analyze myself instead of pointing the finger at my parents

286215 its my lawn and its the middle of the afternoon
286216 and you are absolutely not allowed to party without a dancer
286217 my husband died eight years ago i havent had this much fun since
286218 all the guitar players around here have taken lessons from me or from somebody ive taught
286219 i knew i was in trouble without insurance i didnt know what to do
286220 weve always worked and paid our taxes and look at this incredible program that they have it probably saved my life
286221 you dont like going into an office and saying i dont have insurance i dont know about other people but i feel funny
286222 a staff member called me six months later to remind me of my follow up screening
286223 we have won state recognition for achieving a higher number screening goal than expected
286224 we dont want people to put off any of their screenings just because they think theyre not eligible
286225 we would much rather have people call and make sure people get connected
286226 basically telling everyone we were shooting a video and we kind of did shoot a video and then in the process got married isnt that what everybody does
286227 we draw a crowd when we fire up the barbecue
286228 you can pick one up at a garage sale for around 20
286229 there are hundreds of people who want babies who cant have them
286230 because childline is an 0800 number calls are free and dont show up on a bt or cable phone bill calls to childline on 0800 1111 are currently free from all the existing networks 3 bt mobile fresh o2 orange t mobile virgin vodafone we have been told that calls will not appear on any of these bills
286231 i am flattered that you feel this way about me and i am really glad we spent six months together and i know when im older i wont regret it and will look back and think
286232 silent killer because it doesnt usually cause symptoms while it is causing this damage
286233 its efficient and it allows paramedics to do other things
286234 with autopulse were seeing a return to spontaneous circulation 28 percent of the time
286235 it really comes down to a decision of what you want to do for your community
286236 i immediately fell in love they have a wonderful oder a strange and kind of sweet smell earthy and pleasant
286237 its not scratchy like wool is its also hypoallergenic im not aware of anyone who has had an allergic reaction to it
286238 alpacas are small easily managed and are very gentle animals
286239 people young and old are able to take care of them and the animals havent gone up in price since we started 15 years ago
286240 were on the verge of the death of primary care
286241 we need to fix it and we need to fix it now
286242 we really cant afford health care the way it is right now
286243 we need to do a rigorous analysis and try to reduce the waste of money
286244 we must have health insurance and access to health care for everybody
286245 morally financially ethically and practically we really have to do that and until we do were really not caring for our patients our country our citizens the way we should
286246 people have an intrinsic dignity and when we deny them health care we take away that dignity
286247 it used to be if you didnt have health insurance you just paid cash
286248 we dont really have a broken health system so much as we have a broken payment system
286249 everybody is trying to figure out whats the best way to provide the right amount of care for the right prices at the right time
286250 youve got to involve the physicians the hospitals the insurance companies and the policy makers and whatever plans they come up with have to be financially viable for all concerned
286251 first we have to get all the people to agree we have a problem then we have to get them to agree to the basic principles of how to fix it its got to take the best minds from each sector
286252 while were all figuring out how to make this transition
286253 we all have to worry about it because it could be us
286254 it all boils down to who do i call in the middle of the night when my kids got a temperature
286255 the feeling im getting from my patients is that their coverage is diminishing and their premiums are going up
286256 we have a whole mix of patients but they are all pretty educated and theyve been through it where things arent covered they look ahead
286257 we have heard of people waiting three months for a doctors appointment in canada but then therere people here who dont have health care and not seeing a doctor at all so a three month wait might be fine with them
286258 i dont think we need to go with universal health care some people have incredible coverage now why would they want universal health care but the people who have nothing are the ones we should be targeting
286259 the cure is education knowledge and access there so much out there now that people dont realize it
286260 their job is to link students and families not only to health insurance but also to primary care
286261 nobody should not be denied health care because they cant afford to pay for it
286262 my father told me clay the biggest compliment anyone can pay you is they come to you with their life in their hand and say here doc take care of it
286263 i think the clinic is doing a wonderful thing because no one is turned away
286264 what we try to do is take care of these patients as best we can and then to see if we can get some type of insurance for them
286265 i think that somehow our federal government could come up with a plan similar to social security
286266 i think that people who are working should be able to buy health care through their employer and those people who arent working should be able to get it through the government if they dont have a job

286272 im happy when they put things on the tree they can put anything they want there
286273 some people read in the papers and say can i touch you because youre blessed
286274 i get from poland lots of books rosaries to pray i dont know these people theyre not even from my city
286275 she told me dont cry your church will never close
286276 they come to the apartments where i live quite a lot i suspect most of those are medical rather than fire emergencies
286277 the problem is when our als engine is out on a call the squad is what were calling it is also going to be an advanced life support which will be able to pick up the slack when that apparatus is gone

286311 individual policy measures continue to be presented without these sources of overestimation adequately being taken into account
286312 the modelling that the government of canada uses is just that modelling it changes year by year depending on the different data that we get
286313 if the cap is not a real hard cap but is an intensity cap so that it depends on growth rates of different sectors then you have to speculate on it

286348 i think he had a really good game plan i think my two losses were to pretty good game plans
286349 i feel like i can perform better than that but i had a good time out there i cant wait to do it again i definitely want to fight him as a fighter i dont know about the business aspect but i do want to fight him again friend or no friend
286350 ive got to practice those transitions and get that flow going
286351 i felt like i was tough in my top jiu jitsu game but i didnt get a chance to use it because i didnt put him on his back i didnt practice chasing the guy down and setting up the takedown with punches thats what got me there so i need to go back to it

286355 be careful how you touch her for shell awaken and sleeps the only freedom that she knows and when you walk into her eyes you wont believe the way shes always paying for a debt she never owes and a silent wind still blows that only she can hear and so she goes
286356 she takes just like a woman yes she does she makes love just like a woman yes she does and she aches just like a woman but she breaks like a little girl
286357 a woman can forgive a man for the harm he does her but she can never forgive him for the sacrifices he makes on her account

286384 balanced so that we never want to frustrate the player you never want to make them do something where theyre upset pissed off at the game whatever which fundamentally means that you cant challenge them too much because theres a big trade off there between coddling the player in a bubble of entertainment that moves through all this wonderful media versus something where only a subset of the people who buy games want a challenge
286385 i absolutely do but i can tell you about none of it
286386 right now well probably have a prototype team of about 15 in house by the end of the month and were sort of going from there im super excited about what were doing there but honestly i cant say much about it right now
286387 with doom we havent made final decisions yet but its going to have multiplayer be i would expect it to wind up being a larger focus than it was with quake 4
286388 its still not going to be the central focus of the game its still going to be a single player experience through that thats going to be a finely honed and crafted experience for people to get pulled through but multiplayer will be there as a significant asset and i would hope that we can leverage some of the quake live infrastructure certainly a lot of the lessons that we learned because were going to be really in the thick of the evolutionary stew as we go through this
286389 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now

286398 we were having some fun we were having some fun with our supporters that we sent it out to and were gonna display a sense of humor in this campaign i noticed a couple of days ago that senator obama challenged me to a duel well light sabers is my weapon of choice
286399 but seriously if we have differences we should have appeared at the urban league convention today
286400 ive asked him time after time to appear with me on the same stage so we can discuss the issues that are important to the american people
286401 this is a very respectful campaign ive repeated my admiration and respect for senator obama that clip is of charlton heston its a movie so i really appreciated the movie and i appreciated charlton hestons magnificent acting skills as i saw it but its a movie
286402 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest im we think its got a lot of humor in it and were having fun and enjoying it and that is what campaigns are going to be like thats what every campaign that i have been involved in i am going to enjoy it and im the underdog and we will continue to fight and scrap all the way till november the fourth

286414 i dont watch a lot of football when i go home i dont talk about it much when i go home im not a coach im a dad its just the way it is and always will be when it gets to a point where im losing the balance its time for me to go do something else
286415 i think being the football coach here at nebraska is a little different than some places where you can just stay in your office and put a product on the field and thats how youre judged
286416 people here want to know you want to get to see you and so i think its important there be some outreach
286417 it doesnt matter if its 5 oclock in the morning hes ready to roll thats the biggest thing that i like about him hes always trying to motivate you and making sure youre doing the right thing
286418 on the field im going to do it the way i see fit and with my belief systems and let it all hang out that way
286419 i cant try and please everybody i have to be who i am and do the things i think will help us be successful
286420 off the field i have to do things as a husband and father that are necessary to satisfy my no 1 job and thats to be a father and a husband
286421 that kind of put everyone into a bit of a tizzy just because he was there
286422 what people dont understand especially if theres a night game is if youre not prepared by that morning something isnt right
286423 the perception out there is that to be a great football coach you have to work 24 hours a day i dont see it
286424 ive never worked that way i never will work that way
286425 one of the real hazards of the coaching profession is that you can become so consumed with coaching that your family suffers greatly
286426 im glad to see that bo and his coaches are going to try to strike a balance there because you can lock yourself in your office 15 hours a day and you can do that 365 days a year and it really isnt healthy

286434 coincido con la suprema en que es totalmente inoportuno formular una reforma a la justicia cuando se adelante una investigaci n a buena parte del congreso
286435 inconveniente e inoportuno emprender en este momento hist rico una reforma a la justicia cuando la corte suprema adelanta investigaciones y juicios en contra de algunos congresistas por el denominado proceso de la parapol tica

286449 nn3si ceased operating from the national museum of american history on july 31
286450 as you may know nmah has been undergoing a renovation of the buildings infrastructure and interior for some time the renovation forced us to remove the information age exhibition the stations home since 1990 we placed the station in a temporary location for the duration of the renovation but it cannot remain there when we reopen to the public later this year the information age exhibit will not be reinstalled and since we have no other appropriate exhibition areas within the museum the station had to cease operations at nmah various alternate locations throughout the smithsonian have been considered but none are viable at this time
286451 john johnston w3be nn3sis trustee assures me that a renewal of the license would not be an issue if we need one should a suitable exhibition area elsewhere in the smithsonian institution be found we will be able to reactivate the nn3si activity
286452 we believe this is important not only for us and our bilateral relationship with india but for rest of the world

286462 we are seeking animate and energize our voters and send them the message that the size of obamas crowds are nothing to be intimidated by we are very pleased with the way things are going and where we are

286464 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile tactics
286465 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
286466 we have argued repeatedly that there is no need for federal legislation in this area and todays fcc action proves that point
286467 without making a judgment on the substance of todays ruling it is clear that the federal communication commission is prepared to uphold its broadband principles
286468 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission ftc engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
286469 the once felt urgency for congressional action obviously subsided once fcc chairman kevin martin emerged as a consumers rights advocate
286470 i intend to continue monitoring practices in the industry and pressing for passage of my legislative framework for addressing these issues in the months ahead
286471 the vast majority of network management practices that are being used today will be permissible under the fccs framework
286472 the ones that are problems are ones that are too expansive they target specific protocols and applications even when theres no network congestion but techniques used to identify heavy users and reduce their traffic during peak loads is in principle permissible
286473 were always evaluating our broadband plans and services but have nothing new to announce today regarding our pricing structure
286474 with that said given the usage trends were seeing usage based pricing is one way to deal fairly with internet usage which is very uneven among broadband users
286475 when people make the argument that isps will have to meter traffic its a false choice
286476 going to a tiered model is an economic approach some operators are choosing to go in that direction but there are plenty that can use reasonable network management methods to manage their networks

286478 i should really add a unit test suite for this complicated class
286479 but then id have to create a new unit test file and stuff
286480 they initially cast the problem to me as how can they take the right technical approach to minimize their combined technology and licensing costs ill tell them theyre missing a piece the marketing
286481 from the very outset my career always had one foot in the technical side and one foot in the business development side
286482 until 1990 the greater weight was on the technical side but then it switched to sales and marketing
286483 when were talking about very technical patent litigation where you need to do an enormous amount of technical management you have something that has a lot of characteristics of an engineering project
286484 that doesnt normally happen because usually everyone goes into a crisis mode successfully
286485 if youre doing everything in crisis mode then youre not working efficiently
286486 i can make the process more efficient if i am brought on in a timely way and given a more authoritative role in how to manage the whole activity
286487 experts should be relied upon to give critical input as to strategy
286488 engineering experts have experience in project management if you bring them in as part of the team it should produce a better result
286489 clients like to do business with people they know like and trust
286490 business building is all about the relationships so i teach associates to put their best foot forward with everybody including their paralegals to make that connection with other humans
286491 its inherently awkward when youre meeting new people cold and when its purely a business relationship
286492 nothing bad ever comes from having lunch with somebody a social lunch can turn into a real opportunity
286493 as an associate you have to market yourself differently than if you were a partner but you can still develop business
286494 by making associates responsible for our own marketing budgets even from an early point in our careers av amp h puts the building blocks in place for future business development expectations
286495 dont be afraid to do things that your partners arent doing and dont be afraid not to follow in someone elses footsteps you can make your own footsteps
286496 for a long time our firm operated under the assumption that the senior partners would be our most productive rainmakers but the world has changed we encourage our associates to bring in business and develop their own relationships as andrea has done we believe this kind of activity is at the forefront of what makes a successful associate
286497 a human being should be able to change a diaper plan an invasion butcher a hog conn a ship design a building write a sonnet balance accounts build a wall set a bone comfort the dying take orders give orders cooperate act alone solve equations analyze a new problem pitch manure program a computer cook a tasty meal fight efficiently die gallantly specialization is for insects
286498 when clients are deciding whether or not to continue working with your firm which one of the following attributes or considerations would you say ranks highest on their priority list
286499 i like to use this metaphor to explain the role of institutional marketing at a law firm
286500 the lawyers are the actors the individuals who make the sale of legal services the marketers are the set designers and directors the individuals who set the stage and orchestrate the process in order to facilitate the sale of legal services
286501 if a law firms marketers are doing their jobs right
286502 potential clients have formed a pretty strong positive impression of a firm practice group or lawyer before they even start to talk business if they are not doing their jobs potential clients will have no impression at all or will be swayed by the impressions of others
286503 over the past 20 years there has been a great shift in the roles and responsibilities of legal marketers mostly due to an increasingly competitive and global marketplace
286504 in its early days legal marketing was purely promotional practitioners engaged in a wide range of random activities to promote the firm its practice areas and its individual lawyers
286505 marketers were not expected to examine the big picture those with the inclination to do so rarely had the time
286506 today at the best firms legal marketing has become strategic
286507 senior practitioners make a scientific study of the market and use this information to generate a marketing plan supported by the appropriate legal products pricing placement and promotions
286508 these best practices do not constitute a menu from which law firms can pick and choose a few items
286509 rather they are a prescription the healthiest law firms incorporate at least some elements from each of the ten best practices
286510 a strong differentiated identify correlates with short listing which correlates to increased business opportunity and potentially increased revenue
286511 the successful law firm markets with a purpose it has a carefully crafted brand
286512 cmos tell us that the next position they are planning to add is a market researcher or an analyst
286513 when done effectively and acted upon client satisfaction interviews build loyalty and yield extremely useful information
286514 we predict a significant uptick in formal csi programs over the next few years
286515 good individual coaching can help your lawyers develop their face to face business development skills
286516 members of your external target market should be contacted in some way other than via documents or bills at least 12 20 times each year
286517 software that can search all of a firms existing systems mining them to unearth otherwise hidden relationships may end up as a well received alternative to crms
286518 law firms cannot calculate traditional return on investment for marketing programs in the same way that corporations do
286519 instead create monitor and internally publicize proxy measures like readership studies or web site page hits to assess impact
286520 all three are essential to a successful strategic marketing plan
286521 the day when an entire law firm could be fed by the activities of a few rainmakers is long gone
286522 today every lawyer must be expected to make a contribution to the development of new business using the tactics that best fit his or her own personality and the culture of the firm
286523 for one lawyer this might be public speaking or involvement in a trade group
286524 for another it might be publishing or teaching for another it might be personal relationships for another it might be creating and maintaining a blog or a wiki or perhaps carefully mining a social network for each lawyer at least one tactic will be a comfortable fit
286525 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
286526 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
286527 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
286528 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
286529 officials need to stop downplaying or ignoring whats happening among latinos
286530 hispanics are overrepresented in this epidemic and we need to target our efforts to them
286531 you combine the economic pressures loneliness and immigration worries and it pushes these individuals to be a hidden population
286532 migrants tend to be lonely separated from their family or partners
286533 they do not have health insurance they may turn to drugs or alcohol all of these put a migrant at higher risk
286534 it takes away your inhibitions i started associating with people i wouldnt normally
286535 a government that reflects all peoples political priorities as accurately as possible is the most democratic government and thats the kind of government pr will guarantee that we elect pr will give groups that have been historically under represented in government such as women hispanics the working class and political independents a chance to compete more equally in council elections we hope this will inspire such groups supporters to identify capable leaders within their communities and elect them to office
286536 proportional representation has proven time and again to be the most efficient system for measuring the will of the people its been used both here at home and abroad and best of all it is as easy as 1 2 3
286537 when most people vote for city council they vote for one or two candidates they like a lot and some other candidates they feel comfortable voting for but may not have strong feelings for or know very much about pr allows you to express those preferences by giving your favorite candidates the highest rankings the advantage is that the candidates you like the best get the benefit of your strong support for them its a more advanced way to capture voters preferences than the current 9x system where every vote on a ballot looks equal the results of a pr election are more accurate

286539 now the difference between an 8 and an x is whether or not you have the shelf hip youve got that shelf that your baby sits so easily on where your widest point is the top part of your bottom not your lower hip area so youre an 8 if your hip slides away and the widest point when you look in the mirror is the top of your thighs then youre an x or hourglass shape the difference in dressing these two shapes lies below the waist they both can belt and tuck but the 8 needs to wear straight skirts and trousers whilst the x is most flattered by a lines and bootlegs you may have the high hip of the 8 body but the narrow shoulders of the a body if so draw attention up to the face with pattern and detail above the waist and keep your bottom half dressed like the 8 shape clean smooth and straight lines with no fuss or flounce
286540 a type 8 has fuller thighs while a type x has a fuller bust
286541 i was shaking and i couldnt really stop and i was wondering what was going on

286615 right now my crush is shia labeouf he is cute and a great actor
286616 i went to iran because people have the right to hear both sides furthermore the american people and navajo people are entitled to know what we are being led into and deserve nothing less than full transparency when situations such as these arise i went with a peacemaking tradition armed with navajo prayer and the wisdom of the ancestors
286617 it is the tribal peoples of iran who are the renowned weavers of the many of the persian rugs
286618 i met with iranian youth who are in the process of defining and redefining themselves in relation to islamic republic of iran
286619 as i walked through those ancient sacred lands i didnt see terrorists
286620 saying both navajo and islamic prayers i wanted iranian people to understand the diversity of america the idea of sovereign native nations of distinct peoples as nations within a nation i wanted them to understand some of the realities strengths and challenges of indigenous peoples in the united states most importantly not to see navajo as a vanishing people but as active protagonists in a long and epic battle for complete harmony and self determination i wanted them to know the navajo people not only as the people who walk in beauty but also as a fierce warrior people who have fought and are still fighting for the liberation restoration and healing of our peoples the earth her resources our culture and our language
286621 if the united states were to attack iran it will be with no moral or legal authority
286622 as opposed to dialogue the united states has made threats of violence and have created sanctions that have isolated iran from the international community elevating anti american sentiments as opposed to resolving core contentions
286623 indigenous youth in many parts of the world also are experiencing blatant state sanctioned genocide and are legally denied fundamental rights to life as illustrated in the ongoing human rights crisis resulting from the armed forces special powers act of the north eastern region of india under the authority of this legislation indigenous youth women men and children of manipur nagaland meghalaya and the whole region of north eastern indian are routinely brutally viciously and legally murdered at the behest of the indian government by the hands of the indian army indigenous youth from this region request that the armed forces special powers act be immediately repealed that political prisoners such as irom chanu sharmila be released and that the international community condemn this genocidal legislation that allows the murder of innocent people and simultaneously denies them judicial remedies and recourse to justice
286624 from turtle island united states marcus briggs one of the youngest speakers of the muskogee language delivered the indigenous youth statement on language stating language is not used solely as mean of communication rather it encompasses intricate complexities of our identity language is essential in shaping our worldviews as indigenous young people and we do not deserve nor can we afford to walk this earth without the opportunity to embrace our own language and right here in the united states where english only
286625 we the young mapuche who with the help of our good ancestral spirits recommend to this forum of the united nation that it intercede with the state of chile so that the latter will respect human rights the rights of my autonomous mapuche nation and our former parliament and treaties and so that it will stop attacking our mother earth we are not terrorists for defending what belongs to us and to our grandparents the state of chile uses the tool of terrorism because it is afraid and because it knows full well that we the mapuche are the owner and administrators of the territory as established by our parliaments in peace agreements signed by the former mapuche chiefs so it was willed by our father creator

286683 i can look through an airline schedule and brochure and cheer up
286684 thats how crazy i am about it if i can look out the bedroom and see the planes i am happy
286685 maybe if john travolta or harrison ford is interested in this maybe its something for me
286686 thats really the bigger purpose is to get the young people interested in aviation again and the aerospace industry

286698 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
286699 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did

286719 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
286720 we have argued repeatedly that there is no need for federal legislation in this area and todays fcc action proves that point
286721 without making a judgment on the substance of todays ruling it is clear that the federal communication commission is prepared to uphold its broadband principles
286722 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission ftc engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
286723 the once felt urgency for congressional action obviously subsided once fcc chairman kevin martin emerged as a consumers rights advocate
286724 i intend to continue monitoring practices in the industry and pressing for passage of my legislative framework for addressing these issues in the months ahead
286725 the vast majority of network management practices that are being used today will be permissible under the fccs framework
286726 the ones that are problems are ones that are too expansive they target specific protocols and applications even when theres no network congestion but techniques used to identify heavy users and reduce their traffic during peak loads is in principle permissible
286727 were always evaluating our broadband plans and services but have nothing new to announce today regarding our pricing structure
286728 with that said given the usage trends were seeing usage based pricing is one way to deal fairly with internet usage which is very uneven among broadband users
286729 when people make the argument that isps will have to meter traffic its a false choice
286730 going to a tiered model is an economic approach some operators are choosing to go in that direction but there are plenty that can use reasonable network management methods to manage their networks
286731 plaintiffs privacy claims fail among other reasons because the view of a home from the driveway that can be seen by any visitor delivery person or telephone repairman is not private
286732 todays satellite image technology means that complete privacy does not exist
286733 plaintiffs live in the 21st century united states where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass unless there is a clear expression such as a gate fence or keep out sign indicating that the public is not permitted to enter anyone may approach a home by a walkway driveway or any other route commonly used by visitors without liability for trespass
286734 q does this lead us to rethink privacy and how we protect it
286735 although the word privacy is not found in the constitution brandeis had long believed privacy one of the most precious rights he and samuel warren had written a pioneering law review article on the subject in 1890 and he returned to the theme in his dissent in olmstead v u s 1928 the court had held that wiretapping did not constitute a violation of the fourth amendment and brandeis objected to this invasion of privacy the makers of our constitution he declared conferred as against the government the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men p 478 ultimately the court adopted the idea of a constitutionally protected right of privacy in griswold v connecticut 1965

286766 museums have a lot to gain by opening up some of our community relationships and processes and choreographing with people and not for people
286767 if we had set out to design and build a director it would have come out very much like susan says board chairman peter lipman
286768 i really believe that what museums do is create a crossroads for community and a conversation that bridges artists and people and art work she says
286769 thats very much what this institution has done some museums are reluctant to have a personality they want to be all things to all people or they want to be mainstream
286770 this is a museum that has taken the risk of having personality to differentiate itself
286771 im really proudest of the professional development of the museum having a really creative and highly trained staff in place she says
286772 i like a lot of talk both within and from outside the museum she says
286773 i like it when we get many people from the community at the same table brainstorming ideas and creating points of entry to the museum world
286774 flip a strip will showcase new design visions for refurbishing small scale suburban strip malls the exhibit scheduled to open in october was sketched out on a cocktail napkin during a brainstorming session
286775 that project is exciting to me because it means taking the lead and saying this is something we can all think about collectively and take a research and development process into the public realm that would normally be in the private realm
286776 very interested in playing with program initiatives and ideas of growth i want to be able to focus more strategically and on a bigger picture than i can in the size of institution where i am now
286777 this museums location in silicon valley and in downtown san jose creates a real strong impetus to work with emerging media and the chance to look at whats happening in the international contemporary art world and the globalism of the tech world
286778 there are some great opportunities that are distinct to this institution
286779 its not just the use of technology or things that are technology driven
286780 all of these things are parts of contemporary art making that dovetail with values in the tech world and we can look at in a lot of ways

286796 california is a leader in promoting health and nutrition and i am pleased to continue that tradition by being the first state in the nation to phase out trans fats consuming trans fat is linked to coronary heart disease and today we are taking a strong step toward creating a healthier future for california
286797 this ban is really just an instance of nanny state paternalism keeping healthy should be the individuals responsibility
286798 to the extent trans fats pose a real threat these bans are unnecessary no one is forced to consume trans fats and indeed under pressure from consumers many food makers have voluntarily stopped using them
286799 the fact that some people will choose an unhealthy lifestyle is no justification for dictating what the rest of us can and cant eat
286800 instead of trying to lead the nation in fostering health at the point of a gun california should lead the nation in advancing individual responsibility and individual freedom a good place to start would be rescinding the trans fats ban

286817 when people are reminded of their inevitable mortality they may start to feel uncomfortable about what they have done with their lives and whether they have made a significant mark on the universe this is a state called heightened self awareness one way to deal with such an uncomfortable state is to escape from it by either overeating or overspending
286818 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by nasas phoenix mars lander last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
286819 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
286820 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil

286858 the structure of the race has been remarkably stable all summer
286859 in gallups national daily tracking poll for june and july obama has averaged a three percentage point lead over john mccain
286860 and he has a threshold to cross in order to close the sale he is ahead we know that a number of voters are not sure yet whether they want to vote for him they do not necessarily want to vote against him in fact voters want to elect a democrat they are just not sure they want barack obama
286861 senator obama says he is going to change washington but his solution is to simply make government bigger and raise your taxes to pay for it
286862 we have been doing that for years my friends and it has not worked
286863 the question of whether obama is a suitable commander in chief is one which i think voters will continue to mull over the course of the campaign
286864 he is clearly at a disadvantage to john mccain on this dimension at the moment
286865 they know their republican ideas are used up he said
286866 that is why they are spending all their time talking about me and that is why they are spending all their time trying to convince you that i am a risky choice but the real risk is doing the same thing
286867 he met with leaders they said nice things about him he drew a huge crowd in berlin but he may have been making friends in berlin germany but he may not be doing as well in berlin new hampshire
286868 and i believe fundamentally that in 1980 the election was all about ronald reagan
286869 people did not want another four years of jimmy carter but they were not clear or comfortable for much of the way with whether reagan got over the bar of acceptability to be commander in chief and president of the united states

286895 im going crazy here i wish theyd tell me something
286896 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
286897 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

286900 we are finally done with the school construction and will enroll students for the 2008 09 school year
286901 the school will enroll girls starting from the next year
286902 during the turkish rule of montenegro there were few islamic schools but they gradually died out in subsequent decades
286903 the last islamic school in the republic was closed down in the northern municipality of pljevlja in 1918
286904 but with the growing demand for enrollment a third class will open this year
286905 the authorities allow us into jails to lead muslim prisoners in eid prayer
286906 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
286907 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
286908 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
286909 this is something the military understands but the british public does not
286910 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i reexamined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading the muslims borrowed rituals and traditions from all the surrounding religions
286911 right now this wireless device p2p activity is not a huge problem
286912 carriers dont have unlimited bandwidth and the number of customers using the internet aggressively will increase
286913 the one reason the internet has grown is that the government has been hands off but they eventually may have to get involved on issues such as p2p file sharing as such activity does impact network and network service to other users
286914 this includes placing restrictions on accessing certain content and applications limiting throughput or the amount of data you can transfer and taking action to optimize or improve the overall use of our network and services
286915 we would review any complaints regarding the network management practices of any internet service providers
286916 they might choose for instance to prioritize voice calls to better manage their networks and ensure critical calls such as those made to 911 for emergencies are not held up in the network
286917 there is no amount of copper that is worth the pain this man is going to have to endure

286920 its not so much how shes living its the fact that she had to pay a penalty and she didnt do it and u s marshals will catch up to you
286921 as a catalyst to incite public ridicule and condemnation of plaintiffs johnson and french to the extent that the plaintiffs would not prevail in their upcoming elections
286922 i knew theyd run and hide and try to win on a technicality but im not going to let them get away with it
286923 the change in venue wont have an impact as far as the case is concerned
286924 any jury that hears it will know an injustice has been done it might get a little expensive for everyone driving back and forth but it certainly wont make a difference in the case
286925 the art nouveau movement represented a breath of fresh air in jewelry fabrication
286926 the designs were often symbolic sensuous and ethereal featuring delicate flowers exotic animals and the female form
286927 part of this is to put the jewelry in it context
286928 we included objects that are meant to give you a sense of the sources of inspiration for these art nouveau designers and jewelers
286929 art nouveau jewelry introduced a new aesthetic and it was avant garde for its time
286930 i think they enjoyed the challenge of rendering a very ephemeral insect with a life span of only a few days in a permanent material
286931 notice the eyes are always closed with sort of a dreamy expression to the face
286932 psychoanalysis was an important force at the time so this idea of the dream state was very much present when you look at some of these female figures
286933 owning a piece of lalique jewelry was a status symbol
286934 some of these pieces were never worn a lot of the collectors were men because of the fragility of some of these pieces they were difficult to wear they were displayed they were exhibition pieces
286935 arts and crafts and art nouveau were not very dominant movements at the time
286936 the local a amp j market is a sponsor for much of the food supplied for saturdays festival
286937 a rubber hand stamp with the drive in illustration as the cancelation postmark
286938 like old time advertisements of the 50s and 60s era
286939 i have learned a lot about educational leadership i am pleased to be returning to work if my actions or words offended anyone i would like to take this opportunity to apologize
286940 the district has agreed to settle on these terms because frankly it was the belief it was in the best interest of all parties
286941 which shall be collected from his accrued and or future compensation other than sick or personal leave accruals goeweys personnel file addressing his performance and the districts future expectations it can be removed from his file june 30 2009 at the discretion of the superintendent
286942 the public does need to understand that school districts like oswegos have no ability to impose any level of discipline unless either the employee consents or the district pursues this process that weve been going through known as 3020 a
286943 the district has a consistent and balanced approach that it uses in dealing with situations where employees conduct does not meet the expected standard
286944 while this case has been time consuming and costly it has now been concluded in significantly less time than on average and certainly less money
286945 even when were not working our blackberrys are working and our brains are working
286946 we were looking for a young guy a cool guy
286947 to have it done in canada in our own backyard we didnt even need to travel we drove 20 minutes to the golf course to see him win
286948 its been a three year build and now were ready
286949 were looking forward to spring 09 if its what we think its going to be then we might be able to put a few bucks in our pocket
286950 weve gotten tons of re orders this week and were having some shops giving us a call that never would look at us before
286951 i think ultimately the real benefit will come down the road with the reputation and credibility it gives us
286952 success in life has little to do with what you achieve for yourself it has everything to do with what you achieve for humanity

286954 i want you to have the most perfect day ever i know you will be a beautiful bride and an amazing wife
286955 there is no doubt some impact from drought conditions are having a negative influence on regional activity to an extent and it does look as though the second half of 2008 will be a weaker time for new home construction in areas like albury wodonga for example
286956 he is of the same reality as god as far as his deity is concerned and of the same reality as we ourselves as far as his humanness is concerned thus like us in all respects sin only excepted
286957 since therefore the children share in flesh and blood he himself likewise partook of the same things that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery for surely it is not angels that he helps but he helps the offspring of abraham therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of god to make propitiation for the sins of the people for because he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are being tempted
286958 but you have given me an open ear the more literal alternate reading in the footnote is
286959 they the anabaptists also believed that christ did not take his flesh from mary but held to a heavenly origin for his flesh
286960 abandoning the distinctive two natures formula of chalcedon the radicals were free to deal with the implications either of humanity or of deity without having to worry about the other a smaller number reverted to an arian or adoptionistic view of christ and the first stirrings of the modern heresy of unitarianism began a larger group emphasized the deity of christs being to such an extent that the humanity seemed to disappear in this they had much in common with the early monophysites although they usually lacked their theological sophistication
286961 stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau
286962 ethics is how we behave when we decide we belong together
286963 voc at pode conseguir um grande trabalho no ps3 mas um trabalho enorme o 360 permite atingir os mesmos resultados de modo mais f cil a melhor plataforma para fazer os jogos que as pessoas querem
286964 em teoria se pode conseguir grandes coisas com o cell at mais que com o processador do xbox 360
286965 o fato do blu ray ter vencido a guerra foi timo para a sony e pode ajudar o ps3
286966 quando se trabalha com um hardware que n o t o bom quanto o concorrente em termos de capacidade de processamento
286967 wed like them to be going the other way but its soft everywhere
286968 we are in for the long haul sydney ratings are down but the ratings for non sydney swans games telecast in sydney are down more
286969 its difficult for the one team trying to grow a presence with a list of 38 players and no local rivalry making people in nsw choose teams
286970 attendances are up at the scg and while crowds are down at anz you are talking about coming off a very high base of over 60 000
286971 we have never said it is easy in this market
286972 its the most competitive football market in the world and the job is still ahead of us
286973 we need to continue to get better and more sophisticated when it comes to marketing our product in different markets
286974 so david are you going to go and play with the gold coast
286975 i still have a year to go on my contract and i am pretty happy with where i am there is plenty of water to go under the bridge yet and we will cross that bridge when it comes
286976 i am pretty happy to stay where i am and hopefully the club has got a fair bit of faith in me now to hold me up where i am
286977 with us going to the gold coast as well over the last two or three years we have had a little bit of exposure
286978 i am sure it will intensify in the next two or three years but there is nothing i can do at the moment
286979 those two have been fantastic but it is a love hate relationship
286980 you take a mark and they are not too happy but if you can get it to ground they are always a chance get the best of foxtel
286981 weve got a really good group of players around that age that we think are going to be the future of the club and given some experience and opportunity theyve all shown pieces of play that suggest theres a really good future
286982 bate and jones came third and second respectively in the best and fairest last year
286983 theres a lot of variety theyre not just the same type of player which is a real bonus for us
286984 and our future is really in the hands of not only our recruiting staff but our young players weve already got on board and weve got an opportunity in this years national draft
286985 its a clear direction we need all our members and supporters to get behind theyve been very understanding this year their support has been terrific and the players have really enjoyed that
286986 to be able to sign on with all these young guys we feel were the core group going forward and that something really good is going to happen in the next few years
286987 his form and confidence is probably down a little bit and we just thought it was an opportunity for him to go back to sandringham and play rather than have that form continue to hover at a low level hopefully hell be back in next week
286988 well sit down with jeff in the coming weeks and work out where his situation is from the clubs point of view
286989 but jeff white has been a professional player and an outstanding footballer in the afl for a long period of time
286990 i should have had a bit of money on myself
286991 i think its one of those things thats just worked out
286992 i was talking to the boys the other day about it its just weird how its come up
286993 ive started forward a few times including last weekend and with a couple of them ive pushed forward when there was a good opportunity
286994 theres no pressure on me to push forward but if the opportunity is there the coaches always encourage me to have a go to try and get down there and get used
286995 i love running off my bloke getting into the forward line and kicking goals
286996 its something that i work hard at to try and do as many times as i can
286997 there was a lot of pressure obviously to return to melbourne and my wife was missing her family
286998 it was a tough decision and we took our time to make it
286999 the swans were great they let us know how they felt and didnt put any pressure on us
287000 in the end to be offered a four year deal was huge for us i was rapt we ended up making the decision to stay and its paying off we love it here im glad we stayed
287001 i felt he didnt know how to push himself in those early days
287002 he was very athletic he was the right shape the right size balanced and had good skills but at that stage he didnt know what it took to be a consistent player
287003 his best and worst games were quite a way apart hed play really well then follow up the next week with a poor game
287004 the biggest improvement with darren and i think everyone would say this is while he cant be best on ground every week he is very consistent
287005 he researches his opponents really well he knows them inside out he turns up prepared or committed
287006 i dont think he has reached his potential yet he is improving all the time and should continue to improve
287007 ruckmen take a lot longer i think everyone knows that you can be 27 or 28 before you reach your peak which is unique to the position
287008 to be honest theres a couple of issues there and we may change that squad
287009 he just didnt perform at the level we expected him to
287010 with skipper warren tredrea out we saw it as an ideal opportunity to bring him in
287011 hes got a great tenacity about him and were looking forward to him coming off half back doing that
287012 were not going to play them if they havent earned it and deserved it
287013 to play 17 games in a row is a great effort for a guy of his age
287014 we were trying to get him back by round 18 we think hes still on line to get back by round 19 its dropped back just a week
287015 he had some soreness so we went and got some more mris theyve come up fine so we thought we might even put a needle in and have a look at it to see if we were missing anything and we werent
287016 because he hasnt been active hes got some built up scar tissue there and soreness around it
287017 he was pretty taken back on monday with the pain but i think hes in much better spirits now and hes accepting what it is and trying to push through it
287018 crash proof how to profit from the coming economic collapse
287019 all soviet bloc espionage services were identically organized and had an identical modus operandi
287020 soviet espionage operations can easily be identified by their particular patterns of you are familiar with them
287021 that was his problem the soviet union would have no choice but to accept his challenge
287022 we cannot and will not permit the communists to drive us out of berlin either gradually or by force
287023 contingency plans for using nuclear weapons against the soviet union
287024 the lunatic khrushchev is so furious at kennedy that hes ready to tear him limb from limb with his bare teeth
287025 today people remember khrushchev as a down to earth peasant who corrected the evils of stalin but he was not the khrushchev i knew was a compulsive political chatterbox who had no objective appreciation of facts and who had gotten a taste for the simple criminal solution because of his close association with stalins mass killings
287026 in many cases individuals are removing the majority of their accounts assets
287027 alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again
287028 first warning gold doubles as the greenspan fed makes real interest rates negative for the first time in 25 years now his successor is at it again
287029 its getting increasingly evident that this is a once in a century type of phenomenon
287030 not the standard type of liquidity crisis that we have seen in the past
287031 its still very evident from inter bank lending spreads that we have not gotten closure yet
287032 its essentially fundamentally the price of homes in the united states which are determining the ultimate collateral of mortgage backed bonds pretty much around the world
287033 were still nowhere near the bottom of the home price thing
287034 ultra expansionary us monetary policies with artificially low interest rates led to bubbles all over the world and in every imaginable asset class the price of gold more than doubled in nominal terms and against the dow jones industrial average
287035 central banks of necessity determine what the money supply is
287036 if you are on a gold standard or other mechanism in which the central banks do not have discretion then the system works automatically
287037 the reason there is now very little support for the gold standard is the consequences of those types of market adjustments are not considered to be appropriate in the 20th and 21st century i am one of the rare people who have still some nostalgic view about the old gold standard as you know but i must tell you i am in a very small minority among my colleagues on that issue
287038 gentlemen we are not retreating we are merely attacking in another direction
287039 a faithful friend is a strong defense and he that hath found him hath found a treasure
287040 inflation is a stock bond and currency killer and a gold thriller
287041 the yen representing an economy that is enjoying record surpluses and record growth is weaker than the dollar and the euro
287042 there is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit debt expansion the alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit debt expansion or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved
287043 the four major australian new zealand banks have already received undisclosed billions in loans and quasi capital injections from the australian futures fund
287044 there is an element of public good in investing bank bills because as the abn amro paper pointed out interest rates on home loans would probably be higher if australias major banks had been forced to obtain more expensive funding offshore the future fund took higher risks shifting its deposits from the risk free rba sic reserve bank of australia into bank bills but in doing so it acted within the parameters of its directions from the parliament to take an acceptable but not excessive level of risk
287045 i do not believe that our future fund or reserve bank are involved in underhand dealings
287046 my understanding is that all australian banks have done transactions with the future fund if you want debt in your portfolio having some bank term debt is not a bad option particularly given that you are getting more attractive spreads
287047 is there some federal protection beyond the au 20 000 per account holder which was recently announced
287048 my response is that i havent parsed the terms of their client account protection but this is not an issue
287049 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing a hedgehog concept is not a goal intention or strategy to be the best it is an understanding of what you can be best at the distinction is absolutely crucial
287050 i still cant get over the whole federal reserve racket
287051 i am a most unhappy man i have unwittingly ruined my country a great industrial nation is now controlled by its system of credit the growth of the nation therefore and all of our activities are in the hands of a few men
287052 since its inception in 1913 the federal reserve board has been responsible for almost 95 devaluation of the u s dollar all this has been achieved through its ability to continually inflate the money supply and between 1985 and 2005 the federal reserve board has increased the money supply by five times this extraordinary money creation is merely the catalyst for debt creation in a fiat money system money is debt there is absolutely no way this money can ever be repaid except by continued inflation but now that the credit bubble is blown up inflation is no longer an option bankruptcy looms
287053 the federal reserve what has it done for you lately
287054 sitting on a 20 trillion trembling mountain of derivatives think weimar republic
287055 market intervention data manipulation still accelerating increasing risks the cartel end game and latest forecast
287056 the federal reserve is wholly owned by a consortium of private banks it is controlled by bankers and it protects their interests
287057 profiting from the push to denationalize currencies and deconstruct nations
287058 the two troubled federal mortgage agencies freddie mac and fannie mae will be given unlimited access to the u s treasury without requiring any further approval from congress the u s national debt ceiling will be raised by 800 billion which suggests that the bailout is expected to cost a lot more than the country is being told all credit card transactions will have to be reported to the internal revenue service as if the country isnt under enough government surveillance already
287059 ron paul discloses housing bailout bills money and power grab
287060 but the plan now being pursued is to bail out these private corporations by increasing their capital base with taxpayer money and their profit margins with greater access to federal reserve loans
287061 you can learn little from victory you can learn everything from defeat
287062 we had heard rumblings that new figures were going to be released but no one would tell us anything
287063 however we sort of expected it weve seen 20 new clients since january which is a lot for our small agency
287064 what concerns us most is that much of this group is made up of young people in their 20s and 30s
287065 theyre people who either dont remember what was going on in the 80s or think that with all the medications available now its no big deal to contract hiv that its like having asthma
287066 we need to get back to doing education in the schools which we havent been doing for the past few years
287067 weve seen a loss of funding for education and when hiv aids is discussed in the classroom it is lumped in with other sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea or syphilis which are curable
287068 it does not allow for the best quality of life
287069 if we dont get a handle on this now its just will spiral into a situation that is much worse than it already is
287070 the bottom line is that the hiv epidemic in the u s continues to spread and at a rate greater than was previously thought
287071 the real measure of political leaders and the american people is if this bad news spurs good action the establishment of a comprehensive and accountable national aids strategy that will eliminate barriers to effective prevention generate adequate resources and hold our government accountable for ending this epidemic
287072 the horse has got a leg and a half between two holes in the floor its 8 feet underneath
287073 it basically was straddling this support beam its legs are dangling
287074 because it fell in the corner we had to take part of the stall wall apart
287075 somewhere along the line the vet showed up and gave it a sedative so it wouldnt hurt itself
287076 we pushed it up enough to get a plank under its butt
287077 before they sent only consumption money but now theyre sending in money for themselves
287078 and were giving them new outlets and developing new markets like australia
287079 the biggest growth is coming from the middle east and europe
287080 the increase in world oil prices is far from over hence the pass through from global oil prices to local pump prices will continue
287081 given that the philippines is a net importer of crude oil rising prices may have a multi pronged impact affecting the economy adversely through four channels rising inflation slower growth higher trade deficits and weaker fiscal position
287082 there may be some lag before the momentum in prices is reversed and even then year on year price increases will remain elevated
287083 ensuring a steady decline in inflation and the management of second round effects may require a more restrictive monetary policy until headline inflation slows down
287084 i heard you have p10 5 million for the gold winner i will add p4 5 million so its now p15 million
287085 the president understands that its important to give the athletes the ultimate challenge
287086 you can buy a house marry or even open a business with that kind of money
287087 the intention is good another thing to motivate us to excel
287088 its better to focus on our game plan its going to be difficult if you think what youre going to do with that money
287089 we have four athletes who are very very close to the winning standard
287090 the idea was to give the public not only a musical experience but the chance to look through the telescopes and interact with faculty members and amateur enthusiasts
287091 my criteria is to have good lively music that will get everyone tapping their toes before going on to look through the telescopes and listen to the talks
287092 i get to enjoy my hobby observing and share it with other people and its very nice to hear the music
287093 its our first time being here and its nice were mainly up here for the kids
287094 we came here about 30 years ago during the day i had been in that big room which houses the great lick refractor but not at night and tonight was the first time i looked through the telescope the astronomy was the key thing that brought us here this time but the music was a pleasant addition to the evening it also bridged the time from walking around to when it got dark
287095 i always think about 1888 and bringing things up here with wagons and horses and doing such a beautiful job not only is it scientifically so advanced but its artistic the architecture is beautiful even the hinges on the doors are gorgeous this is an incredible place and the acoustics are wonderful
287096 untwinkling the stars improving our view of the universe with adaptive optics
287097 whats life got to do with it the new science of astrobiology
287098 i dont remember much i had used too much drugs
287099 we are going to be taken now to a london police station from there my mum can get her head together and get her thoughts together
287100 i cant sleep i cant eat im going crazy ive lost six pounds

287103 the item youve requested is not currently available in the us store
287104 the item youve requested is not currently available in the us store
287105 remind me to use the travel certificates before may 18
287106 we have music you can have a chat you have no troubles when you are dancing
287107 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
287108 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
287109 frankly as rollouts go i so would have liked to see this go way differently and way better
287110 human health in a changing climate a canadian assessment of vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity
287111 you very well could see some new platforms some new vehicles out next year
287112 we continue to reprioritize our capital to make sure we are responding to one of the most significant changes we see in consumer buying preferences to downsize and look for fuel efficiency
287113 e mi manchi amore mio tu mi manchi come quando cerco dio e in assenza di te io ti vorrei per dirti che tu mi manchi amore mio
287114 it certainly does not make easy listening bain says the vibration of the towers as they were hit by the hijacked passenger planes sounds like tuning forks
287115 sees nothing morally questionable in making an artwork out of the event
287116 of which the cosmos and all celestial bodies are made
287117 is a one thousand year long musical composition it began playing at midnight on the 31st of december 1999 and will continue to play without repetition until the last moment of 2999 at which point it will complete its cycle and begin again
287118 this is the line to get down to the convention floor in here is where they do autograph sessions inside the building on this floor is where they do all of the panels if you really want to attend one of the big panels expect to sit in line for at least an hour and a half when you get down to the floor stay out of the middle that is where fox abc nbc and wb all have their booths and they get bogged down if you really want to check out those booths do it today cause it will be wall to wall people on saturday and sunday
287119 just head that way and when you see the line waiting get your bags from them

287149 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
287150 and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
287151 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
287152 what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
287153 in no ways do i think that the mccain campaign has targeted race issues
287154 i will say that the way that theyve amplified this you know has been troublesome and the eagerness with which theyve done it indicates they think they can exploit this politically but in fact what i have said and theres no doubt about this theyve said it themselves is that they want to make me appear risky to the american people
287155 just a sustained caricature of me and character attacks against me
287156 i now had a vast quantity of paper at my disposal and i set about filling the notebooks with odd facts stories from the past and all sorts of other things including the most trivial material on the whole i concentrated on things and people that i found charming and splendid

287175 for customers looking for a smartphone with tethering capability we have many other options
287176 sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time
287177 were hoping well get some feedback from apple tomorrow at the very least i would hope apple will allow it in countries where the provider does permit tethering

287207 i havent received any official information on the use of recl detonators recovered from the surat bombs
287208 we want to find out how they reached the terrorists as of now there is no information about whether the detonators were purchased or stolen
287209 as many as 1 500 detonators are usually packed in a single carton on which the batch number is properly written the manufacturing companies maintain a record of the batch numbers of cartons supplied to the dealers
287210 detonators are transported in trucks and are sold through registered dealers the records are properly documented the ultimate delivery is the prerogative of the dealers and we have no control over it

287224 when he is hungry he eats and when he is sleepy he goes to sleep
287225 what are you talking about you call these miracles everybody is doing that

287227 my master is a great man he can walk on the water
287228 foolish because i can simply go to the ferryman and for just two pennies he takes me to the other side your master is a fool go and make him aware that he should not waste his life it can be done so easily

287236 the fact that online social networkers consume more mobile content and media than mobile subscribers who arent into online networking may not be really surprising
287237 however what we have long suspected is now confirmed by the numbers for most kinds of mobile content online social networkers consume about twice as much as their non networked peers

287282 i said i will not die on that bridge i am not going to die today
287283 this is not the way i am going to go
287284 when i hear that many states have close to a majority of their bridges deemed obsolete or structurally deficient that scares me and i think that finding ways to help remedy those problems that simultaneously relieve states of the burden financially is very very important and should be a welcome trend in the united states

287341 things got to the point where they had to do something and they did
287342 things escalated to degrees where something had to be done either way either way i think its a relief that theres closure to something thats been going on for the last week or 10 days im just relieved theres an actual solution which there was going to be regardless on this day
287343 i feel like this did have to happen sometimes you make decisions regardless of whether you got a worse player or better player out of that deal it makes your team as a whole better i think thats what their decisions was based on that feeling of camaraderie and 25 guys playing for the same goal
287344 every time you hear the rattling of these sabres the reality is that for the conservatives there is still a really far way to go to win a majority so its really not in their interest to have an election
287345 and the liberals are behind so its not really in their interest to have an election so we really wonder what all this rhetoric and chatter is all about
287346 to have a reasonable shot at a majority the conservatives have to be at least a couple of points ahead of the grits in ontario and right on the tails of the bloc in quebec

287348 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
287349 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
287350 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
287351 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
287352 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
287353 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

287357 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
287358 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
287359 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
287360 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
287361 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
287362 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
287363 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

287395 it was in the past during the soviet jihad that a few pro taliban elements had found their way in and with the change in policy have been firmly been rooted out
287396 years of backing an anti soviet jihad has left its mark
287397 there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taliban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of pakistan
287398 we need to identify these people and weed them out

287401 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
287402 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
287403 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
287404 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
287405 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
287406 and that investment can come from outside sources as well

287416 i love visually transcribing music and having recently acquired some great kraftwerk albums my inspiration ran rampant the wallpaper is a transcription of kraftwerks song techno pop
287417 this is the abstracted idea of globalized television broadcast that came about in the 1940s to 1960s the multicolored designs are my rendition of audio video waves mingled with television feedback which is how i imagine these signals floating above and beyond our planet even though they are ultimately invisible
287418 for me august equals summer and what says summer better than the ocean so i took the colorful theme from our website threw in some waves dolphins cool summer sky and some halftone patterns and mixed them all in
287419 monster sushi and is a product of procrastination i came up with this character when i was putting off filling out some very important forms
287420 one of the things that pop into my mind when thinking about august is fruit besides summer and warmth plus ive just discovered the museo font and i thought it would be perfect for the job
287421 the inspiration for this wallpaper came from a beautiful night sky and the flames of a bonfire flying up to the sky
287422 i made this image in reaction to what has been a very grey and wet english summer and also to inject a little color and karma to my day i hope it does the same for you
287423 she looked at me with that curious expression when i was swimming in my pool one lazy afternoon thinking
287424 carrio has been designed in architectural terms like an idea for seatting on
287425 in this wallpapers the summer concept goes directly related to the high temperatures for this reason i have wanted to dedicate the calendar of august the warmest month to the refreshing summers baths the principal image is of an advertising cut of the 70s
287426 ive seen this guy several times taking a nap on the grass while i have my lunch in the park old port montreal he seems to be enjoying summer i wish i could be as relaxed as he is
287427 i have fresh new wallpapers for you to give away for free this august i chose autumn like colors and the theme is typo loving and art nouveau
287428 the typography is based on itc garamond and while drawing i just started pulling random stuff floating in my mind into the design
287429 this design is a big geometrical flower pattern with each flower made up of smaller abstract patterns inspired by escher and old japanese kimono designs the patterns and abstract lines create a chaotic blossom full of movement
287430 when august comes it remind me of 14th august 1947 when my lovely country pakistan was came into being so i am dedicating this wallpaper to all the lovely people of my country this wallpaper contains national monument pakistan which is located in islamabad
287431 august is the month filled with sunlight yellow and sand beach the sun in this wallpaper comes from a mosaic a made for a table
287432 i just wanted to play with nice typography and make a composition for this special month i chose elephant one of the most marvellous fonts ive ever seen despite of the winter chilly days passing now in argentina i just marked out the first day with warm orange for one reason its my birthday oh by the way the baby girl is my daughter carmela against pollution and in favour of her plastic rabbit

287437 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
287438 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
287439 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
287440 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
287441 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
287442 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
287443 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
287444 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
287445 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
287446 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
287447 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
287448 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
287449 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
287450 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
287451 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
287452 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
287453 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
287454 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
287455 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
287456 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
287457 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
287458 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
287459 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
287460 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
287461 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
287462 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
287463 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
287464 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
287465 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
287466 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
287467 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
287468 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
287469 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
287470 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
287471 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
287472 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
287473 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
287474 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
287475 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
287476 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
287477 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
287478 they are overprices stuff on the fringes is easily a third of the price and more authentic
287479 people in elizabeth city have been reinvigorated under carols capt bennett leadership one officer we spoke with in elizabeth city noted that
287480 captain bennett presents a command presense that ellicites trust and confidence in the workforce
287481 enforcement personnel went door to door and evacuated residences within at least one square mile of the kingsford train bridge
287482 a shelter was set up in aurora in florence county at the hillcrest school and red cross from iron mountain is staffing the shelter
287483 we believe we have the suspect weve been looking for all night
287484 he is in custody at this point and our investigation will be continuing
287485 the most important thing for developers is to make sure they follow the community master plan
287486 i guess i would just urge some caution in evaluating this to be looking at the whole picture
287487 were making sure that were following proper procedures so there wont be any criticisms in the future
287488 ok well were still going forward with you being nominated
287489 the facts litigated at the suppression hearings were detailed by the press
287490 moreover the schwieterman family recently authored a letter to the editor though certainly they would deny any inappropriate motive in the timing of the publishing of the letter it is easy to interpret the letter as an attempt to garner sympathy for nicholas schwieterman
287491 though not filed the issue was reviewed by the defendant with the court within weeks of schwietermans arrest
287492 since their initial claims of jury pool prejudice there have been numerous articles and extensive coverage of this case including the suppression hearing their failure to claim otherwise now is only inviting error
287493 over the past few years we have received a growing number of requests for tests that screen for common health conditions
287494 there is a trend among consumers to assume greater personal responsibility for their own health and wellness
287495 i look up to him and may want to be like him when i get older a successful african american man
287496 you can either take this road that is going to destruction and all this violence or you can like levares make something out of your life
287497 this is all that the kids have to identify with
287498 so i said that for everything negative that comes out ill show them something positive that comes from out of lima
287499 right now we are having a lot of black on black crime and this is an african american man that has done something with his life instead of being a drug dealer and messing up his life and being in jail
287500 im thankful that hes there fighting for us and never gave up
287501 this is something that we can do to help them to show support and show that we care about what they are doing
287502 we thought this would be a great way to better serve the community strengthen our relationship with the hospital and let the patients focus on getting well
287503 doctors will be able to fax down a patients prescription we will fill it and offer bedside delivery
287504 family and friends visiting someone in the hospital can also stop by and get their prescriptions filled right here
287505 id rather be playing catch with my old mole than doing this fu king photo op right now
287506 rachael has kept a diary all her life and shes talked about writing a memoir so it stands to reason shed finally go through with it

287508 if rachael decides to reveal down and dirty details about her life and not jut gloss over them shell earn an advance of 3 million but shell have to drop the perky shell she wears on tv and deliver on her dysfunctional childhood and marriage
287509 the book seems to be about rachael wanting to get some things off her chest she apparently believes that revealing her personal struggles will help win over her critics she may be ready to finally tell her side
287510 we were too young to drink but that didnt stop us we were pretty smashed on rum and coke
287511 rachael plans on discussing the muggings and how she had issues with men because of the attacks
287512 i have known him a long time hes very talented and coming up a rising star
287513 i knew id have to be consistent in order to win

287523 you just have to decide if youre a tigger or an eeyore
287524 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
287525 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
287526 if you have this fluid situation you have elements within the army within the isi who have the opportunity to move forward with their own agenda with respect to afghanistan and india
287527 the peace process is in limbo there is no direction this is what has opened up the door to these elements
287528 what you can say really quite clearly and not get into too much argument about it is that the 360 is much easier to develop for its easier to get the performance out of it that it can deliver and the rasterizer the gpu side is generally faster than what the ps3 has
287529 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
287530 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
287531 we are making remarkable progress it is totally unbelievable that we are where we are only 5 weeks after a heart transplant we even went out for our first dinner and a movie last night we are starting to feel almost normal again
287532 in 2001 i read an article about a group of ebay sellers in atlanta called the atlanta ebaybes amp emales alas now defunct and really liked the idea
287533 meetings include a back to basics class taught by member volunteers with topics ranging from how to improve best match search results to digital photography a full dinner buffet and a guest speaker or powerseller panel guest speakers are usually an author or an ebay paypal staffer our july 28th meeting will be the first ever joint meeting of the dallas amp ft worth ebaybes amp emales chapters dallas ebaybes amp emales group is truly a labor of love and one of my greatest accomplishments my vision is to see at least one chapter in all 50 states my dream is to become ebays ambassador and travel around the country teaching others about the benefits of an ebay group and how to create their own
287534 why punish us for buyers we cant do anything about
287535 why does ebay think it knows better than us about what our customers are saying
287536 when data and emotion come together we need to listen to both
287537 i dont know what the past was like im sorry for the past but come join us for the future
287538 if everyone says his item descriptions are accurate communication good times and costs reasonable i will lose my ps status
287539 ive been to 7 ebay lives and i can tell you ive learned more at this one than at any other time youve come here with incredibly intelligent insightful questions and ideas and were all taking notes
287540 we frequent the groups and read newsletters these give us the most value for our time and keep us updated on the ebay community
287541 we find it a win win win for us the charity and the buyer we have been fortunate as ebay sellers and appreciate the fact that we can use the same vehicle that brought us our success to give back to others in need
287542 i enjoy helping other members be the best they can be and sharing my experiences with them i find it extremely rewarding to watch people i help grow their ebay careers
287543 ebay giving works is where my heart is as an education specialist i include it into all my classes automatically
287544 when i started buying and selling i didnt know a lot about the site and i was helped in the answer center by some great members i wanted to give back to the community once i had the knowledge myself plus i learn something new every time i help out in the community
287545 the ability to use ebay anytime anywhere has allowed me to enjoy a connection to the world i wouldnt otherwise have
287546 when i was getting started on ebay there were friendly people willing to extend a helping hand to me its my pleasure now to return that kindness to my friends and neighbors in the ebay community
287547 hands down the ability to contribute to the fun and success of others
287548 after filling up my truck with yard sale finds on weekends i would borrow a friends digital camera to list the stuff on ebay during the week
287549 i love being self employed and selling on ebay has allowed me to grow a successful online business while working flexible hours
287550 best of all i am able to donate 10 of all sales to farm sanctuary i get a feeling of satisfaction knowing i am helping make the world a better place for farm animals and other creatures
287551 thanks for stopping by i am 70 years young and really enjoy buying and selling any and every thing on ebay
287552 i miss meg and bill they always treated me good and i had confidence in them i will stay with ebay and adjust to the changes if you think out of the box youll make it youve got to stop thinking whats ebay going to do for me and learn to help ourselves
287553 it took me five trips to the hardware store to fix this cart and had to get the pipe cut twice before it would fit
287554 im going to stick with the one that brought me to the dance
287555 i look to see what it takes to solve the problem and think about how i can make it work for me
287556 im not telling you it is going to be easy im telling you its going to be worth it

287558 my legs were shaking when youre in front of the team the fans are out here its as real as it gets in a game setting i was back there the fans were getting all fired up when i hit the 52 yard field goal i was like what the heck lets back this thing up and give it a shot i just hit it real good its good to feel when you hit a ball good and it really goes
287559 i think that having us together for two years now its going to be pretty positive in my opinion we had a great practice schedule last year our statistics in practice were outstanding usually your practice and your games are very close you play like you practice you practice like you play the same thing being true here through the minicamps and so far during training camp weve been very consistent im hoping that transfers over

287579 the common view of cohabitation as a steppingstone to marriage needs to be seriously questioned
287580 instead serial cohabitation may be an emerging norm as cohabiting unions form and break up
287581 if marriage promotion programs hope to target poor cohabiting women our results seemingly suggest that the likelihood of success is not assured
287582 commitment and stability are at the core of childrens needs yet in a great proportion of cohabitations these two requirements are absent
287583 sometimes i give lessons at 6am but i dont mind getting up very early for something i love
287584 it was the end of three great years i had a chance to see my classmates again and to thank the lecturers for letting me on the course its because of them that i am where i am today
287585 i felt i d get a better degree in the uk

287589 its not just about foraging for free food at the back of su permarkets its also about giving back with our time to the wider community
287590 there is reason and logic behind what we do landfill sites emit harmful gases and toxins into the atmosphere such as methane and so if you can recycle some of this youll be reducing the environmental cost and also the cost to supermarkets who have to pay someone to dump their waste in landfills
287591 there is usually much more food than you can take but i dont like to take much because the bins are used as a source of food by homeless people
287592 ive never had food poisoning from bins so its a fairly safe way of saving money im just one of these students who looks to save as much money as possible
287593 im also motivated by the fact that our consumer culture produces so much waste im taking that waste and making it useful
287594 everything you find in the front of the store you will invariably find at the
287595 when you see the quantities you become quite angered at the injustice because what you see is wasted wealth that someone else can use
287596 the reactions ive got have been varied from the irrational hey you cant steal my rubbish put it all back to ok thats fine after we have explained ourselves
287597 in north carolina where i used to live dumpster diving was such a popular activity that many businesses put padlocks on their skips to keep out scavengers i guess from fear of being sued what i have done is rescue several non food items such as repairable wooden chairs from skips
287598 in certain circumstances i might retrieve food from skips but in a place such as st andrews it is fairly difficult since our only central supermarket ensures its skips are inaccessible to the scavenging student
287599 when my parents were students in the 70s they used to go round the back of shops and help themselves to food and household goods that had been thrown out
287600 i come from stroud in gloucestershire a rather hippy part of the country and most of my friends salvage clothes and stuff from skips there is an element of fun to it it looks cool and is about making a statement
287601 from my experience supermarkets have made sure you cannot get hold of their food by putting locks on their bins but with friends i tend to make it through festivals by getting food this way
287602 the reason men dont like her is because she dresses for herself rather than for them

287616 i love the course and i love the way its been set up i love the opportunity to get our games ready and sharp for next week going into the pga
287617 from the way we understand it the more rest the better hell be
287618 three days off not throwing it feels a lot better now than it did a week ago
287619 im just proud of my race team and were doing the right things
287620 im impressed with mark and the speed that he and dei are showing and once we get into this race kasey kahne is going to be a factor so is denny hamlin carl edwards jeff gordon and a bunch of other guys and its going to be a good race
287621 theyll be a lot more ready this year what we did last year was unbelievable it was a dream come true the only thing id like this year and its not much is just to finish one spot higher
287622 im sure that if id tried to do this in 1998 just after winning the championship it would have been a lot easier
287623 although theres a lot of respect for what ive achieved my oval experience is not huge and even though there was the indy 500 win in 1995 ultimately what people want to know is how youd do in a 36 race season how you do on the ovals and are you still hungry enough to do it
287624 a good showing would help with the sponsors but it wont have any effect on the teams because this is a road course
287625 we had a good race last year but you can tell the level of competition has stepped up
287626 im confident weve got a good crew here and a good car unfortunately most nascar races are like the last two minutes of overtime in hockey it gets out of control if theres a caution with 10 minutes to go cautions breed cautions theres going to be a lot of contact thats what caught us out last year we need to avoid that
287627 he is an amazing road course racer and hes been driving this thing since january
287628 so if he was strong last year he should be even stronger
287629 goodyear brought rain tires but i think theyve been towing them around for six years
287630 i saw them in mexico in march and they looked a little purple
287631 but i feel good in the rain i think we have an advantage but whatever nascar decides to do youve got to be versatile
287632 my guess is thered be a lot of carnage and you dont want that
287633 when youve got high speed approaches long braking zones and tight corners it makes it very difficult in the wet
287634 its not like mosport or le mans or even mont tremblant where you can sweep through the corners this place itll be tough
287635 i thought it was going to be a tear or something like that
287636 i still think i can help this team in a big way

287645 what does she i mean you what do you think hes doing
287646 hes seeing someone else how can he be unavailable 80 of the time sean its because hes seeing another woman isnt it
287647 no he could be seeing four other women based on your figures
287648 the timing there are two times when its especially unacceptable for a man to be seeing another woman the first is any time thats especially unacceptable but its particularly especially unacceptable this early on for him to be seeing someone else so bloody soon
287649 youd prefer he decided to see someone else only after hed got to know you better
287650 its especially unacceptable if he sees someone else in response to getting to know me better of course
287651 but it is still particularly especially unacceptable for him to do it when he hasnt even finished getting to know me properly
287652 i used to look at pinot grigio and say whats this all about

287792 i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
287793 i think it started with dwight early in the game he got it going on the defensive end which led over to the offensive end once he holds it down in the middle like that we feed off of that
287794 kobe locked him up he got a couple of open shots throughout the course of the game but when kobe was on him i dont think he scored
287795 i think he was actually a little tentative to shoot the ball when kobe was on him

287805 its pretty easy as long as you do your homework
287806 this morning i had fresh plums for breakfast and heard the hens cackling
287807 its whats left over after you take out bowie seabrook and lanham
287808 part of the challenge is how do you want to present yourself
287809 latest headline news pet waste has now become a problem
287810 that is probably not the first mental image you want readers to have
287811 the idea was to put a positive face on a neighborhood in southeast
287812 you are going to find that most of our young people do the reverse commute
287813 you move into a neighborhood to get more than housing
287814 my husband and i both work at nonprofits were not the rockefellers
287815 do they want a little more house and a little more commute or a smaller house but be at home by 6 oclock every night
287816 especially if you have to get on the mixing bowl or 270 or heaven forbid the beltway
287817 there are houses on the market sitting for six months or a year because owners arent willing to lower prices there are too many to choose from and because builders are still building more
287818 if i had a crystal ball id pick a lottery number and run
287819 i hope it changes and changes quickly but i dont see that happening however for at least a year
287820 we definitely have diversity in this neighborhood in a really good solid way
287821 theres actually lower and middle class and educated upper middle class people of all colors and different ethnic backgrounds
287822 it was before open housing so therefore it was very difficult to find a house even in montgomery county that was for sale to us in 1967
287823 you had some neighborhoods or some homes that were open but not all
287824 even when i was the lone black in this neighborhood for a while it has been a great place to live
287825 they taught me how to save money how to fix my credit
287826 if i had gone to bank of america on my own theres no way i would have gotten a loan
287827 it has worsened as housing prices have gone up and with condo conversions
287828 a lot of people are being left behind by that prosperity
287829 when i was growing up a 1 million house meant you had a pool and a driver
287830 think of what we automatically associate with 1 million millionaire
287831 the current mortgage environment makes financing that million dollar home costlier relative to a more moderately priced home than was the case a year ago
287832 we have all these grand thoughts about what we could get but when buyers see what they actually can get for that inside the beltway theyre often deflated
287833 if you bought your house in those communities three years ago when the market was higher you may have spent 40 000 or 50 000 on different options such as granite countertops or a finished basement
287834 and now if you are selling that house you have to compete against new homes from the same builder who is offering to do things for the buyer as an incentive for them to buy
287835 the choice is yours 50 off options no limit or well pay all closing costs
287836 ive adjusted to having that up there but it needs to be cleaned up
287837 my kids think its cool to see the prison towers
287838 we came over here and looked and just loved it in a new community you get to pick out all of the things in your house you want
287839 we have easy access to interstate 395 and the fairfax connector bus to the springfield metro its a great place to live
287840 newer larger homes access to the vre and 395 and south county secondary school
287841 its a great kid friendly community we have a lot of kids activities
287842 they marvel that they can get something here at this price
287843 we had an opportunity to go to dover last year and try to qualify for the race
287844 i think we practiced like 38th fast and then went out to qualify and i think ended up 47th out of 49 car that were there that day we were pretty disappointed about that
287845 but then we go back there in june and we qualified 16th and we got a top 20 run 18th at the end of the day
287846 i think that just shows how much easier it is the second time you go to a track and just know what to expect out of these cars and what youre looking for out of the car
287847 obviously coming back to a track for me is just experience and gives you confidence
287848 but as a team were working through this new car and being able to come back with a baseline starting point is only going to help us to improve our performance
287849 you get an hour and then you qualify and where you qualify really dictates how your weekend is going to go
287850 not having to worry about figuring out the racing line and figuring out what you need to do that first hour and be able to just go out there and work on the car and work on your qualifying trim is going to be a big thing
287851 the unknown of what to expect from the new car as the races go on is going to be a little bit less now that were going back the second time to these places
287852 last year i couldnt even breathe getting in the car for qualifying because it was so nerve racking for me
287853 now i have the confidence in the team that we have a fast enough car to just go out there and put a lap down and not just make the race but qualifying in the top 10 and run up front
287854 its definitely a lot better but i dont want to do it much longer
287855 the track is fine its perfect its the same track for everyone
287856 the more bumps and the more patches and cracks and character it has i think the better thats my take on racetracks is that theyre not supposed to be perfect
287857 we think about it every week top 10 finishes are what we need to do to secure our spot in the chase and go to new york for the postseason awards ceremony and all that were working hard at it
287858 mon int r t cest de garantir que nous ayons le genre de politique nerg tique globale capable de faire baisser les prix de lessence

287860 too strong too fast sensing kate was way too desperate a woman who clearly cant be on her own without a man in her life at all times
287861 she and chris have always been close and she turns to her exes after most of her breakups
287862 they have the best place on the planet to vacation
287863 that doesnt mean we cant be real cautious very concerned
287864 you top up the card with money and then use it to pay for goods safe in the knowledge that you can never go overdrawn or into debt
287865 the labour market has remained fairly strong up until now but we predict that this will soften over the second half of 2008 as the number of people claiming unemployment benefit continues to rise
287866 if youre talking about mortgages and any sort of secured debt the lender can force you to sell the property or they might repossess the property so people could actually end up homeless

287882 il fallimento di ginevra lapertura dei mercati solo se conviene ai paesi ricchi
287883 che lo scoglio pi difficile fosse quantificare i livelli di protezione per gli agricoltori ossia dare esatti valori percentuali alle riduzioni di dazi e sussidi era del tutto prevedibile commenta sergio marelli direttore generale di volontari nel mondo focsiv ma non che questo fosse ancora una volta la causa del fallimento del negoziato ancora una volta speravamo che la responsabilit dei governi dei paesi industrializzati come di quelli cosiddetti emergenti prevalesse sugli interessi particolari e di breve termine
287884 ora lunica certezza che a trarre i maggiori vantaggi dal fallimento saranno ancora una volta gli agricoltori dei paesi industrializzati usa e ue in testa aggiunge marelli che continueranno a ricevere sussidi alle loro produzioni ed esportazioni
287885 prodotti simbolo dello scontro ineguale tra ricchi e poveri sono il cotone per gli usa e il pollame per gli stati ue il primo protetto dalla concorrenza di paesi come mali benin ciad e burkina faso laltro che continua ad invadere i mercati dei paesi pi poveri ai quali si destinano gli scarti delle ricche mense europee commenta marelli lapertura dei mercati e la liberalizzazione del commercio sono teorie sempre evocate ma applicate solo quando avvantaggiano le economie dei paesi ricchi leliminazione totale dei sussidi alle esportazioni agricole prevista negli accordi della omc per il 2013 sembra diventare lennesima chimera rischiando di perpetuare le pratiche nefaste di dumping che soffocano le economie e danneggiano la capacit produttiva di paesi gi vulnerabili
287886 la crisi del sistema multilaterale infatti spiega marelli provoca il proliferarsi di accordi bilaterali e regionali che vanno a scapito soprattutto dei paesi pi poveri con capacit negoziale inferiore rispetto alle grandi economie industriali basti pensare al caso del messico che dallentrata in vigore del nafta accordo stati uniti canada e messico diventato da produttore di mais a importatore di mais dagli usa

287911 i know that many good priests and lay people share my concern that the enforcement of copyright by icel over the past decades has not served the church well the restriction of publishing rights to one or two publishers has given rise to a monopoly with the result that only poorly produced books are available for priests to use in their parishes there are many catholics who would be willing to finance the production of good quality beautifully produced missals were it only possible to do so without falling foul of copyright restrictions

288000 the hookers loved me i treated them like women like ladies
288001 youre not gonna dump a body if its gonna leave tracks its preferable to dump before it rains it washes evidence off victim and the evidence around the crime scene

288003 what he is is a narcissistic self centered ego maniac serial killer
288004 i believe had we been able to play the tape for the jury i think they would have come to the conclusion that death was the only sentence for this calculating cunning killer whom i analogize to a ted bundy

288011 uh i guess anyway if your dates dont like you for you you shouldnt bother with them
288012 its good to be back at training camp where i dont have to participate
288013 for about 30 seconds i was like um i kind of miss it i had my favre moment then realized that im not going to do that im done
288014 it makes me sick looking at him at least he didnt wear his super bowl ring out here
288015 i told him i didnt know if id let him in here hes still got buddies over there
288016 every time i looked over he had a lot of people around him thats just the perks of being a super bowl champion
288017 hes taken on a new role being part of the media so i dont really talk to the media that much
288018 i enjoy waking up when i want to i enjoy saying do i feel like working out nah this is going a lot better or just as well as i expected
288019 you cant beat winning the super bowl and playing the way that we played there is just value in the way that we ended
288020 i won the ring thats good enough im not going to push my luck
288021 that was the toughest team and the best team in the league that we played
288022 after that game we did feel like we could win it all that was the real challenge for us playing against the cowboys and i let jerry know that
288023 bretts a phenomenal player and person so its hard now to see all the things that are happening because i think it takes away from his legacy
288024 you just dont want to see anybody like that tarnished in any way because of what theyve done for the game of football
288025 its either made right on this side of the grave or the other
288026 nobody gets by with anything but we do just have to wait on the lord
288027 but this is good enough for government work its better government work than i had expected at this point
288028 i made it my prayer and my hope that this is the end of it
288029 i often wondered what was going and why there were no answers
288030 i just hope they find the real answers and settle this once and for all
288031 i dont think it ever really left the scene here not completely
288032 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
288033 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
288034 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
288035 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
288036 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
288037 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
288038 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
288039 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
288040 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
288041 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
288042 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
288043 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
288044 a quiet man he was always very helpful and pleasant
288045 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
288046 doesnt look like all the other presidents on dollar bills
288047 but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
288048 the goal is to have a greater impact than al gore has had on global warming
288049 he envisions an aggressive campaign to make this the no 1 public policy issue in america and drive to real measurable change
288050 but it doesnt matter how much wind or solar energy you generate if you cant get that power to the people who need it
288051 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
288052 you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline despite a major export boom that is the primary reason that growth continues in the economy
288053 there are a lot of 7 15 an hour jobs out there
288054 i have to pretty much take whatever i can get just to get a job
288055 i just cant seem to find something thats worth my while
288056 gas food everything is getting more expensive and jobs just dont pay
288057 they get their expenses paid and cars paid for they dont know what its like and im a republican
288058 i just dont see it getting better before it gets worse
288059 plants are closing even harleys laying off ill take any job i can get just to get by
288060 all i can say is were proud of that commercial
288061 we think americans need to know that i believe that we should base this campaign on what we can do for americans at home and how we can make americans safe and prosperous and thats the theme of our campaign
288062 i respect and admire sen obama but we have stark differences
288063 mr bostock is going around talking about it i dont think that helps the company it makes it seem weak if youre going to have a deal its not going to help if you keep talking about the breakup

288065 these findings suggest that some of the memory impairment experienced during aging could involve a reduction in the automatic process of experience replay
288066 this is the first study to suggest that an animals ability to perform a spatial memory task may be related to the brains ability to perform memory consolidation during sleep
288067 this studys findings could inspire the development and testing of pharmacological agents designed to enhance memory replay phenomena
288068 we know that environmental cues are significant in many addictions including tobacco and alcohol and contribute to relapses
288069 this study identifies the specific neuronal process involved and helps explain relapse even after rehabilitative therapy or long term abstinence
288070 these potentiated synapses are persistent regardless of what your new behavior is and because the memory is still maintained it could trigger relapse when the conditions are repeated
288071 this is a clear validation that drug addiction is a life long disease three months for a rat could equal several years in a human although drug taking behaviors may be absent the memory makes relapse not only possible but likely
288072 overall these findings show that their brains are not working properly to start with and the metabolic impairment gets worse over time
288073 however we dont know why or how this happens our study shows for the first time that individuals with an alzheimers disease affected mother may be at increased risk for developing alzheimers disease themselves because their brains are not utilizing glucose in an effective way
288074 at this point we can only speculate that genes that are maternally inherited may alter brain metabolism
288075 we need to follow subjects for longer time periods to ascertain whether the metabolic reductions are in fact forerunning cognitive deterioration
288076 this includes checking for blood pressure cholesterol levels glucose levels arteriosclerosis and vascular damage in general because improving cardiovascular health is particularly important to also promote brain health
288077 if an individual finds out that they are at risk for developing alzheimers disease and are not taking much care of their health thats already a good reason to start immediately
288078 one could collect the children of mothers with alzheimers disease divide them into a placebo group and a drug test group and follow them with neuropsych tests and brain scans to see whether the group receiving the drug had delayed onset or prevention
288079 our best hope is to catch the disease early and treat early
288080 one way of doing this is to identify people with significant genetic risk but we only know one common risk factor apoe4 gene
288081 this is significant because it broadens the utility of imaging as a tool for detecting the disease early not simply in those with a specific form of genetic risk
288082 now it needs to be paired with clinical trials for new approaches for prevention

288094 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
288095 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
288096 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
288097 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
288098 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
288099 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
288100 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
288101 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
288102 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

288109 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
288110 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

288246 recently some special interest groups have claimed without providing any scientific rationale that some methods of contraception may have an abortifacient effect the hormonal contraception is abortifacient theory is not established fact it is speculation and the discussion presented here suggests it is error if a family weighing all the factors affecting their own circumstances decides to use this modality we are confident that they are not using an abortifacient

288264 the core reason social media programs are successful is because theyre about people not money
288265 some might obsess with the r but i would ask them to first begin with the i what is the cost of the methods and technologies what is the big i with new media i would start there that in fact it is pervasive and is becoming a global and historic phenomenon because the i is virtually not there it is essentially free and available to all it is very cheap to adopt these things if there is an investment it is on management attention and time to make sure these things are done and adopted thoughtfully and strategically
288266 one of the reasons that the defence is kicking up such a fuss is because there is no one to witness these injuries that x sustained in the assault
288267 thats just what i need how are you set for time
288268 well ill need a statement so that i can evidence the injuries as someone from a professional background your account will be weighty
288269 because of your background dealing with victims of domestic abuse you will be able to add some greater context to matters when things get to court
288270 thats right thats why i need this evidence the statement the victim needs this evidence to assist her case against her ex partner
288271 oh im not sure i can do that ill have to check with my line manager can you wait a minute
288272 insurance purposes and its not in our remit ill still give a statement but i just cant go to court
288273 hmmm in an ideal world that would be great chances are that you will still be required in court if you give a statement there is every chance that the crown court judge will summons you to court they want to hear evidence in person
288274 so you wont give a statement for our client for x

288289 i really do believe learning a language opens so many doors for young people
288290 some of those kids i had in kindergarten grade 1 and grade 2 and then grade 10 grade 11 and grade 12 so im very close you can appreciate that having those young people for the amount of time that i did to work with them were very close and they come and visit me regularly and are part of my cheerleading section if you will
288291 id taken it to the english department the english department thinks that this person writes as well as any other non first nations child so why shouldnt she be in grade 12 english
288292 anyhow in the end she enrolled in grade 12 english and got 72 per cent
288293 thats the part that really saddens me there are too many students were simply putting them in classes without really knowing where they should be and working with them even if they are short of skills
288294 theres no use being in a classroom and teaching mediocrity
288295 if you teach to mediocrity youre not encouraging those who are bright and those who are medium or lower level students have nothing to work towards

288299 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis

288305 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
288306 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
288307 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
288308 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
288309 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
288310 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease

288322 as a result the company has taken considerable steps to reduce ongoing operating expenses as evidenced by the recent reduction in corporate workforce in addition i am spending a considerable amount of time in the field working to restore sales activity while several factors have contributed to slower than anticipated growth in our associate numbers the company believes that the wellness industry will grow domestically and that our direct sales channel is capable of restoring sales growth to historic levels

288352 we see the soviet atheistic policy of a bygone era echoed in attempts to artificially limit the influence of faith on the larger society and restrict it only to divine services and social care for poor people
288353 cannot help but be concerned with the development of aggressive secularism in western european countries as its spirit is similar to the soviet attitude towards religion frequently an unattractive or even intentionally perverted image of christianity is promoted in the public sphere indeed some believers in the west seriously speak of seeing christophobia in some quarters they even created a website to record such incidents
288354 people from eastern europe where new churches are being built are pained to hear that christian churches in the west are sold or leased for commercial purposes some european cities are even thinking of selling christian churches to other religious communities
288355 one sees outbreaks of hostility against christian symbols in public places for example the removal of crosses and christmas trees from schools
288356 contemporary european pop culture promotes material consumption homosexual relations debauchery and a relaxed attitude to abortion and drugs on the political level its difficult to give moral tolerance to the violations of the rights of national minorities in some counties of the european union along with glorification of various types of fascism

288412 he said he was going to kill her i wanted to send them to him by email to show that although he didnt have the courage to do it someone here did

288418 perhaps in googles world privacy does not exist but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google

288423 there is not one shred of evidence to disprove politifacts conclusion that the candidates name is barack hussein obama or to support allegations that the birth certificate he released isnt authentic and thats true no matter how many people cling to some hint of doubt and use the internet to fuel their innate sense of distrust
288424 for all the excitement about turnout in the primaries there are about 40 or 50 million people who have not confronted the obligation to vote for obama or mccain yet in 2008
288425 most of them will turn to this task soon but few will before labor day that great mass of voters will solidify and may change the balance of public opinion on the presidential race
288426 our commitment to nuclear power does not depend on one single deal
288427 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
288428 we are dedicated to preserving our objective to become a major player of nuclear in great britain
288429 i am disappointed we thought it was a good deal edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder it is now a matter for both boards to see how to proceed
288430 the future development of britains nuclear energy capability is at stake the public is reduced to bystanders witnessing the failure of the governments market led strategy for keeping the lights on
288431 he has got to get a grip and put the interest of the uk public who foot the bill before the self interest of the shareholders
288432 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
288433 at least forty quid a night for special branch officers to risk their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa
288434 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
288435 he is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
288436 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened
288437 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
288438 it is like a bad comedy my relations with the protection officers were cordial and i am still friendly with a few of them at the end of my nine years of protection they held a reception for me i had a lot of sympathy and understanding from the police our relationship was the exact opposite of what has been written i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
288439 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
288440 i dont even want to dignify that with a response
288441 it is extraordinary to have had to go through an experience as unpleasant as that period of sequestration to have somebody to try to cash in giving a false portrait to a publisher a very senior member of the scotland yard protection service telephoned me to apologise and said the police force felt humiliated and embarrassed
288442 police officers thought if i was incurring costs it would be fair to contribute to that that was an offer made to me by senior officers of special branch it was never a request of mine to say that i was trying to extort money from them for my protection is an obscene distortion of the truth
288443 your conduct serves to increase the risk to him rushdie and to his publisher without the slightest public interest justification i invite you to mitigate the damage you have already done by withdrawing the book and removing the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
288444 apart from anything else what he has written makes the police look bad the idea that the police would treat somebody they are supposed to protect in this way is very disturbing the idea that i was so unpleasant to them they locked me up is totally made up
288445 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
288446 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
288447 at the moment the animal is bobbing around but if and when this animal comes back in it will have to be euthanised
288448 theres no coming back from renal failure its not good news but is what we expect from these cases
288449 luckily we dont get many things like this happening on the south coast
288450 a lot of people cannot quite believe that we have a whale down here they are willing it to survive theres a certain empathy with wild animals particularly whales and dolphins we have a special relationship with them
288451 the blood test results indicate thats why it was stranded in the first place and the chances of survival are very very low from what the vet said its going to die anyway we are very disappointed
288452 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
288453 you are going to see more airlines go bust if you look around there are a lot of airlines out there that have not been profitable in the past few years those guys will not survive
288454 airlines are going to have to reflect the higher oil price we will have to do something and its not just ba that will have to adjust prices the whole industry will have to
288455 we are not talking about grounding aircraft but the average utilisation will come down slightly
288456 it looks a bit odd to be shrinking on the one hand and calling for a third runway on the other
288457 o z luis d um equil brio defensivo muito grande e n o temos outro jogador nessas caracter sticas o hugo um jogador que est fazendo a diferen a na frente al m disso ambos s o importantes na bola a rea
288458 o anderson est um pouco abaixo dos demais e tenho que saber a hora certa de colocar o jogador
288459 os dois dedos dele est o bem amassados mas n s estamos pensando em uma maneira de colocar isto na hist ria
288460 sometimes i give lessons at 6am but i dont mind getting up very early for something i love
288461 it was the end of three great years i had a chance to see my classmates again and to thank the lecturers for letting me on the course its because of them that i am where i am today
288462 i felt i d get a better degree in the uk
288463 i am a better player than him now but we always have a good game
288464 when he had that knee injury during the us open he persevered and won the tournament
288465 my aspiration is to be one of the top female coaches in the world through being leadbetter trained
288466 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
288467 at least forty quid a night for special branch officers to risk their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa
288468 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
288469 he is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
288470 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened
288471 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
288472 it is like a bad comedy my relations with the protection officers were cordial and i am still friendly with a few of them at the end of my nine years of protection they held a reception for me i had a lot of sympathy and understanding from the police our relationship was the exact opposite of what has been written i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
288473 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
288474 i dont even want to dignify that with a response
288475 it is extraordinary to have had to go through an experience as unpleasant as that period of sequestration to have somebody to try to cash in giving a false portrait to a publisher a very senior member of the scotland yard protection service telephoned me to apologise and said the police force felt humiliated and embarrassed
288476 police officers thought if i was incurring costs it would be fair to contribute to that that was an offer made to me by senior officers of special branch it was never a request of mine to say that i was trying to extort money from them for my protection is an obscene distortion of the truth
288477 your conduct serves to increase the risk to him rushdie and to his publisher without the slightest public interest justification i invite you to mitigate the damage you have already done by withdrawing the book and removing the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
288478 apart from anything else what he has written makes the police look bad the idea that the police would treat somebody they are supposed to protect in this way is very disturbing the idea that i was so unpleasant to them they locked me up is totally made up
288479 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
288480 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
288481 its not just about foraging for free food at the back of su permarkets its also about giving back with our time to the wider community
288482 there is reason and logic behind what we do landfill sites emit harmful gases and toxins into the atmosphere such as methane and so if you can recycle some of this youll be reducing the environmental cost and also the cost to supermarkets who have to pay someone to dump their waste in landfills
288483 there is usually much more food than you can take but i dont like to take much because the bins are used as a source of food by homeless people
288484 ive never had food poisoning from bins so its a fairly safe way of saving money im just one of these students who looks to save as much money as possible
288485 im also motivated by the fact that our consumer culture produces so much waste im taking that waste and making it useful
288486 everything you find in the front of the store you will invariably find at the
288487 when you see the quantities you become quite angered at the injustice because what you see is wasted wealth that someone else can use
288488 the reactions ive got have been varied from the irrational hey you cant steal my rubbish put it all back to ok thats fine after we have explained ourselves
288489 in north carolina where i used to live dumpster diving was such a popular activity that many businesses put padlocks on their skips to keep out scavengers i guess from fear of being sued what i have done is rescue several non food items such as repairable wooden chairs from skips
288490 in certain circumstances i might retrieve food from skips but in a place such as st andrews it is fairly difficult since our only central supermarket ensures its skips are inaccessible to the scavenging student
288491 when my parents were students in the 70s they used to go round the back of shops and help themselves to food and household goods that had been thrown out
288492 i come from stroud in gloucestershire a rather hippy part of the country and most of my friends salvage clothes and stuff from skips there is an element of fun to it it looks cool and is about making a statement
288493 from my experience supermarkets have made sure you cannot get hold of their food by putting locks on their bins but with friends i tend to make it through festivals by getting food this way
288494 i had a number test today i knew i could do them but it all went too fast the only thing i got right was my name even then i got one of my letters the wrong way round
288495 sometimes i give lessons at 6am but i dont mind getting up very early for something i love
288496 it was the end of three great years i had a chance to see my classmates again and to thank the lecturers for letting me on the course its because of them that i am where i am today

288500 my aspiration is to be one of the top female coaches in the world through being leadbetter trained
288501 cnn has mixed in footage of riots that took place in budapest hungary with that of the riots in belgrade
288502 some comments on the web seem to hint that perhaps cnn were deliberately trying to make the protests seem more violent than they actually were i dont really believe that but still how does somebody accidentally edit in footage from an entirely different country and which was filmed over one year ago
288503 giving up the 10 strikes gives us three plus days
288504 i am not going into the reasons because its nobodys business
288505 con la firma de esta ley damos un paso importante para cerrar un cap tulo triste en la historia de puerto rico y para garantizar que los servicios de salud que reciben los puertorrique os sean ofrecidos por profesionales altamente capacitados

288509 giambi cabrera betemit im not even gonna watch this game
288510 i cant believe he is not playing nady what is he doing let nady play center melky is useless
288511 to be playing betemit instead of nady is giving up the game ill tune in tomorrow what a bunch of horse excrement
288512 nady hit another homer for the yanks yesterday yet he sits today its the stretch run why is he not playing everyday
288513 tonights game is over its only 4 11 did they start it early or something
288514 let me get this straight a guy hits two hrs but does nothing the rest of his at bats and hes the greatest thing ever i thought this was a yankee blog not a dave kingman appreciation blog
288515 you guys do realize betemits going to have a crazy game tonight with like two grand slams just for kicks right
288516 of course we trade karstens and he shuts out the best offense in the nl
288517 why did we trade for an injury prone guy like that didnt we know
288518 just heard nady is day to day with a sore quad
288519 one can only assume that this is do or die time for ponson his last eight starts going back to his time in texas have been pretty awful ponson has pitched 42 2 innings allowing 67 hits and 18 walks his era is 6 12 and opponents have hit 368 against him
288520 spare me with livan i thought the idea was to try and improve the 5 spot over ponson and how does livan circa 2008 do that his world series ring isnt helping his whip or his era this year his only moment in new york should be spent hanging out with el duque not starting for the yankees
288521 if nady is out who should play sexson give me a break this is complaining for the sake of complaining
288522 i love it when folks starts quoting whip at me i really didnt realize so many folks here worked for bill james
288523 perhaps it is perhaps it isnt what it definitely is is a cheap way to make folks who post on comment sections on blogs sound a bit smarter than they actually are apparantly this mystical whip involves a crystal ball as well
288524 torii hunter is out for the rest of the series he went home to attend a funeral
288525 uhh whip is a pretty basic stat it has nothing to do with bill james its no more complicated than rbi
288526 wow rasner just went six innings and gave up two runs gutsy start
288527 christian 1 k 3 walks in 14 games with a 280 average and has 4 steals
288528 wow congrats to 90 of the people here for being whiny retards
288529 ponson walks a lot of batters and he allows a lot of hits whip is just quantifying exactly how many of each he allows
288530 i hate to say it but at the risk of sounding like an old man in his
288531 okay so if whip is cheap what then do you consider the rollys royce of statistics used when evaluating a pitcher oh all knowing and wise one
288532 you may have a point about how people use stats but this isnt really a good example whip is about as basic as it gets
288533 you forgot to list how so many posters were jonesing for gonzalez and wanted to kill betemit and ensberg to get him up here loved him for one or two games and then spent the rest of the time talking about how much he sucked and how they wanted him sent back down
288534 there are only a handful of people on this blog hmmm patrick and cb to name 3 that actually know how to correctly apply stats to a discussion
288535 and if he gets out of the inning without any damage thats where this
288536 ponson is fine against the oaklands and torontos of the world but not against potent offenses
288537 still i dont think they are anywhere near as scary as when figgins was hitting up a storm and eckstein was on the team and glaus and erdstad
288538 the nationals have decided to release both felipe lopez and paul lo duca and replace them with emilio bonifacio and elijah dukes
288539 trisha pitching emergence saunders and santana good contact hitters torii hunter good defense great closer
288540 so surprising that the count and trisha would be in agreement huh
288541 it will take a few days for the dust to settle
288542 the government must force british energy to make available their sites in order that international consortiums can build the next generation of nuclear power stations
288543 we do not have the luxury of time failure to act now will result in huge problems over the next 10 years with the uk reliant on imported gas and oil a situation that would be an environmental economic and political disaster
288544 a push for more nuclear power would scupper the uk renewable energy industry and by doing so cancel out the prospect of creating hundreds of thousands of british green collar jobs
288545 it seems individuals have succeeded in reining in their spending and riding out the tough times longer than anticipated but its unlikely to last
288546 the trickle down effect of the credit crunch wont truly hit personal insolvency figures for the next six to 12 months
288547 had been overtaken by the consumer who has overspent in recent years
288548 the chancellor is looking at all of these options sensibly and fairly as he always does and he will come forward in due course with his proposals
288549 weve got to encourage very significant investment in our power generation system over the next 10 to 15 years
288550 we have got to have a fiscal regulatory climate that encourages all of that investment because quite simply it will go elsewhere if there is not confidence in the uk market
288551 they could offer another 50p a share and still find themselves in the same position
288552 a huge concentration of electricity generation in the hands of one supplier over a quarter of the market in one supplier
288553 the government does have to get on with creating the climate in which these new nuclear power stations are built
288554 levels of new business plummeted further and at the worst rate in over nine and a half years with manufacturers facing increasingly tough conditions abroad as well as at home
288555 pointed to a further marked reduction in uk manufacturing output
288556 a bleak picture for the uk economy despite the gloomy report from the cips the city believes a cut in interest rates from the bank of england is unlikely next week at a time when manufacturers are pushing up prices the cips index of factory gate prices rose from 62 6 in june to 63 1 in july
288557 we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
288558 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy
288559 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
288560 our commitment to nuclear power does not depend on one single deal
288561 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
288562 we are dedicated to preserving our objective to become a major player of nuclear in great britain
288563 i am disappointed we thought it was a good deal edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder it is now a matter for both boards to see how to proceed
288564 the future development of britains nuclear energy capability is at stake the public is reduced to bystanders witnessing the failure of the governments market led strategy for keeping the lights on
288565 he has got to get a grip and put the interest of the uk public who foot the bill before the self interest of the shareholders
288566 specifically we are examining what policies are in place and how firms ensure compliance with them whether and how rumours are verified whether traders are permitted to pass on or trade on rumours and how firms ensure staff do not initiate or spread false rumours
288567 there is no doubt false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on march 19 and these would have had some impact on the share price it is difficult to say how much as the share price was affected by other factors
288568 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
288569 you are going to see more airlines go bust if you look around there are a lot of airlines out there that have not been profitable in the past few years those guys will not survive
288570 airlines are going to have to reflect the higher oil price we will have to do something and its not just ba that will have to adjust prices the whole industry will have to
288571 we are not talking about grounding aircraft but the average utilisation will come down slightly
288572 it looks a bit odd to be shrinking on the one hand and calling for a third runway on the other
288573 weve been building shopping centres for 50 years and have opened in all sorts of economic circumstances
288574 the essential point is that we are long term investors
288575 we dont take a lot of notice of these short term fluctuations we like the fundamentals of london its one of the worlds great destinations it has above average growth in uk retail sales and like elsewhere in the uk it is under supplied by high quality retail space
288576 we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002
288577 were in for thinner volumes as summer holiday season continues and the heightened levels of volatility are unlikely to disappear any time soon
288578 its not just about foraging for free food at the back of su permarkets its also about giving back with our time to the wider community
288579 there is reason and logic behind what we do landfill sites emit harmful gases and toxins into the atmosphere such as methane and so if you can recycle some of this youll be reducing the environmental cost and also the cost to supermarkets who have to pay someone to dump their waste in landfills

288590 from my experience supermarkets have made sure you cannot get hold of their food by putting locks on their bins but with friends i tend to make it through festivals by getting food this way
288591 its really about packaging and subscription options for the consumer
288592 positive free cash flow before satellite capital expenditures for the full year 2009
288593 the really big question is how they will eventually accomplish merging the two technologies
288594 and then how do you stay ahead of the technology
288595 sound diversification strategy in different digital terrestrial television systems and its radio cinema and internet businesses
288596 the importance of this judgment is that it reinforced the value of a pardon
288597 it establishes a presumption that a persons rehabilitation restores their moral integrity
288598 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
288599 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
288600 frankly as rollouts go i so would have like to see this go way differently and way better
288601 human health in a changing climate a canadian assessment of vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity
288602 some problems persist with how individual policy measures are calculated and with their projected emission reductions
288603 individual policy measures continue to be presented without these sources of overestimation adequately being taken into account
288604 the modelling that the government of canada uses is just that modelling it changes year by year depending on the different data that we get
288605 if the cap is not a real hard cap but is an intensity cap so that it depends on growth rates of different sectors then you have to speculate on it
288606 we thought it was on the optimistic side in terms of how much reductions would actually happen
288607 i think having a cell phone is like nicotine for smokers
288608 i had to call edge wireless because i thought it was wrong
288609 i have to tape them because theyll fall off and theyll stop working
288610 all of my buttons are taped because they keep falling off
288611 i didnt know it was that many i just texted all the time
288612 she doesnt really like to help out around the house anymore because she cant because every two seconds her phone goes off
288613 its not like its every mothers dream to have a daughter that texts as much as she does but she still gets good grades
288614 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
288615 in real life she had never seen any woman arrive to breakfast in a silk satin and lace neglig e every one did on the films to see one of these lovely visions in the flesh was almost more than she could believe
288616 i knew it the minute i laid eyes on you i knew you were the kind of person to be relied on flattered bewildered excited miss pettigrew made for the door she knew that she was not a person to be relied upon
288617 a beechams powder very good i understand for nerves stomach and rheumatism
288618 i dont like to jump to conclusions but i think there was a little jew in him he wasnt quite english and well i do think when it comes to marriage its safer to stick to your own nationality
288619 ive seen them but i dont think well even show them at the games convention in leipzig
288620 growing up i loved comic books a lot of people did
288621 but i think we were afraid to express how we felt and yknow kept ourselves to this other world here youre not alone everybody shares your dream
288622 people want you to sign their skin but you dont know if they have an allergy to the ink
288623 i describe it to people as like the cannes film festival but for science fiction im a nerd myself so i enjoy this kind of stuff
288624 there are girls everywhere normally straight up this place used to be full of guys
288625 its a whole new comic con its like a frickin coldplay concert girls whooping the whole time
288626 a few years ago i experienced a bad time in my life and i thought about ending it all
288627 and the reason i didnt stan was you and your comics i experience rage like the hulk i get confused about my identity like the x men now i live for two things stab my six year old boy and your comics
288628 a lot of people were probably thinking hes not much of an underdog any more hes a rock star now so this is easy for him
288629 so i got to be an underdog all over again i didnt have it easy
288630 at first i would just go to comic conventions and just walk around now i make that difficult for myself because i write comics but its so good to have a book that was appreciated acceptance was optional i wanted the work to be appreciated
288631 a geek is somebody who bites the heads off chickens in a circus a nerd is just way cooler
288632 moscows toughest detective chicagos craziest cop theres only one thing worse than making them mad making them partners
288633 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
288634 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
288635 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
288636 because brachypodium is a model for all of these important crops this resource needs to be available and theres a big demand for it
288637 this is one of a series of deployments that we have had since the global war on terror began weve been deploying both army and guard resources thoughout all of this though weve been able to maintain our responsibilities to state support
288638 poderia incorrer em atrasos na divulga o das informa es
288639 eles reclamaram mas isso normal minha preocupa o nem o jogo de domingo mas como eles estar o para a partida da quarta feira 6 vamos procurar descansar os dois para saber as condi es
288640 you hate it then its over and you kind of dont hate it
288641 be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle
288642 enjoy the apples while you can soon there wont be any
288643 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments
288644 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
288645 i was looking at him on the news and just thinking what an amazing moment this is watching his speech in berlin and thinking what a critical moment this is for america and for attitudes towards what they can achieve amongst the black community if barack obama can do it it will be the most fantastic boost i think for black people everywhere around the world i think john mccain has many many wonderful qualities but i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world that they can win
288646 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
288647 spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
288648 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
288649 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
288650 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
288651 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
288652 i am going to china this time as the u s president who happens to be a sports fan
288653 in terms of foreign policy in the far east it is mistaken if someone were to say that my preoccupation was on the war on terror
288654 our relations with your country thailand south korea with japan and china have never been stronger and it took a lot of work to get bilateral relations as strong as they are
288655 india and china and the u s will provide great opportunities for entrepreneurs and businesses throughout the region
288656 itll provide opportunities to work collaboratively on strong strategic areas security areas on the environment
288657 our vision is once that issue gets solved if north korea verifiably gives up its weapons programs ambitions then the six party talks can serve as another multilateral mechanism
288658 i will also remind people that i will be sprinting to the finish that i will finish this job strong
288659 the legislatures decision represents a significant milestone in advancing this major natural gas pipeline project to connect stranded u s natural gas reserves to alaskan and lower 48 consumers
288660 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
288661 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
288662 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
288663 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
288664 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
288665 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy

288667 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal

288669 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic
288670 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic

288678 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
288679 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling

288682 the speaker wouldnt let us have the five minute speeches because she didnt want the day dominated on the floor by speeches pointing out she has not allowed a vote on a single measure to permit greater oil exploration for the past two months this is our answer to the orange revolution and our modern day boston tea party
288683 republicans are too scared to go home to face their constituents after voting against bills to force big oil companies to use it or lose it demand that the president free our oil from the government stockpile and crack down on speculators
288684 in a week where exxon mobil made the largest quarterly profits by a u s corporation republicans are staying in washington to argue that big oil deserves more taxpayer lands
288685 word spread that the speaker who was never actually here on the floor was going to shut down the house press gallery

288715 in reimagining church frank viola is at the top of his game showing a serene soaring mastery of the theology of church as organism rather than organization
288716 dissent is a gift to the church it is the imagination of the prophets that continually call us back to our identity as the peculiar people of god may violas words challenge us to become the change that we want to see in the church and not to settle for anything less than gods dream for her
288717 true to form this book contains a thoroughly consistent critique of prevailing forms of church however in reimagining church frank viola also presents a positive vision of what the church can become if we truly reembraced more organic and less institutional forms of church this is a no holds barred prophetic vision for the church in the twenty first century
288718 frank not only pulls fresh insights out of well known concepts but also keeps challenging us to go back to basics and focus on christ himself thank you frank this practical book will identify what church can look like when it is focused on jesus
288719 reimagining church is a valuable addition to the resources being produced on the subject of organic churches written from the perspective of a long time practitioner frank conveys these concepts with his usual clarity and insight and covers many of the practical aspects of starting a church i recommend this book to anyone interested in organic church
288720 reimagining church will be certain to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed at the same time frank viola cuts through the fog by putting his finger on the problems of man made churchianity while providing a solidly biblical practical and strategic vision for a powerful new testament expression of the body of christ
288721 reimagining church is a readable and livable description of organic new testament rooted church life for the twenty first century avoiding the weeds of both wooden fundamentalism and unreflective over contextualization frank viola paints a winsome and attractive portrait of a gospel people inhabited by the holy spirit with god in christ as their energetic center frank helps us learn from the peculiar genius of jesus and his earliest followers planting seeds for authentic deeply rooted life together
288722 for those who are not threatened by the idea that church must change reimagining church is an absolutely timely and much needed perspective delivering a solid biblical vision for the body of christ
288723 the body of christ has been stifled by human traditions for far too long reimagining church charts a fresh course for the church that recovers the simplicity of christ and listens seriously to what the voice of the great shepherd is saying to his people
288724 if pagan christianity exposes the reality that much of our current church practice has little basis in the bible reimagining church takes the next step to establish what truly biblical church life looks like with the inner life of the trinity as the starting point viola paints an amazing picture of organic church life
288725 if we are indeed at the cusp of the next major reformation of the church as many suggest then frank viola is one of the significant voices we all should lend our ears to franks humble heart and bold keyboard have once again delivered a book to be read by those who desire to take an honest look at the state of the contemporary church reimagining church calls us to first remember the church from the original blueprint of scripture
288726 what if the word church in ordinary conversation called to mind uncontrived joy or where god has his way instead of pews parking lots and preachers what if church people had no idea what a sinners prayer or tithing meant but were instead joyfully repentant generous without hesitation and innately compelled by love what if church were not a place to learn religion but the best tangible proof of gods existence reimagining church hazards a dream while pulling together the best rational arguments for church as it could be
288727 oh sure i can do that and itll look great itll look just like that really trendy movie thats getting all the buzz but only bigger and trendier and buzzier
288728 oh this guy is different he really will respect me in the morning

288880 before going on it is most important to state that if pets do go to heaven their owners will also have to go to heaven to see them the bible makes it clear that the majority of people will not go to heaven see matthew chapter 7 verses 13 and 14 mat 7 13 14 for one example therefore it is critical that we remind everyone that they need to get right with god themselves or their chances of seeing a departed pet again are zero
288881 obviously what god has prepared for us is wonderful beyond comprehension therefore love your pets as much as you can while they are here those of us who go to heaven will later understand that everything worked out perfectly regarding our pets

288902 in any new surrogacy law it is important that the first and foremost consideration should be the interests of the child

288940 for young people who want to take part in after school or pre school activities for young people who simply want to socialise without access to transport they cant do it
288941 for the whole community in terms of accessing jobs public services without transport its impossible
288942 people in rural wales already suffer huge amounts of additional costs in terms of transport and housing for example on wages that are on average lower than those in urban wales
288943 if the government is going to eradicate poverty across the face of wales they need to address issues about transport access to better paid jobs and at the same time housing for people in rural wales
288944 the recent rise in fuel prices combined with the scarcity of public transport results in an ever increasing difficulty in accessing crucial public services
288945 our rural communities suffer because of low levels of income and a shortage of jobs
288946 as a consequence there is a skills drain as experienced and knowledgeable citizens abandon rural wales in order to find work
288947 the welsh assembly government is very aware of the need to address poverty in rural areas
288948 alun cairns is hard working and cares deeply about the vale of glamorgan
288949 he made a terrible mistake and politicians have to be responsible for the words that come out of our mouths thats why he is suspended
288950 im very upset because i had this bike for about six years
288951 i was very sad to lose it im thinking of introducing sharia law for bicycle theft i will consult the mayor of london but im sure he will agree
288952 i think the fact that it is so very new that its meant that weve had to see how we can deal with it
288953 thats why i decided a month or two ago that i would look at the scrutiny arrangements well keep that under review over the next year as well
288954 some are more difficult and complex and sometimes more controversial than others and therefore require more debate and more scrutiny
288955 my committee has been working incredibly hard and catching up very quickly our workload has increased by 50 were not complaining about that
288956 they should not be asking what are we going to to do with them when weve got them
288957 that is a very worrying issue in relation to those powers coming to wales
288958 the change in the arrangements for home oxygen services was not well managed and the reasons why those arrangements failed were foreseeable
288959 it is disappointing that some of the intended benefits to patients have yet to emerge
288960 it is even more disappointing that previous lessons around contingency planning risk management and communication with those affected or responsible for delivering change were not applied in this case
288961 the whole unnecessary incident was managed chaotically and it was also extremely distressing for our patients
288962 we acknowledge that the transition was not as straightforward as we would have wished these difficulties were not unique to wales england experienced the same problems
288963 i can say i dont think it was marketed very well because if i had known about it it probably would have been at the top of my list
288964 i thought it was superb i couldnt believe id found this little facility in the heart of denbighshire
288965 there are only two young people living in hyfrydle only one of whom is from denbighshire
288966 on this basis the facility was losing the council 500 000 a year
288967 even if the three other young people for whom placements had been identified again only one of them is from denbighshire had taken them up the annual loss to the county council would still have been 300 000
288968 acted to stem such a significant financial drain on its resources
288969 intensive work is being taken forward both by our own officers and those of other authorities to find good alternative placements for the young people affected
288970 we are also doing our utmost to avoid redundancy for the staff involved
288971 the ministers attempt to link a decision on one facility to wider and systemic matters and the councils corporate governance
288972 i think it is absolutely disgraceful that taxpayers money is going to be spent on drumming up support for a yes vote in the planned referendum
288973 determined to build on the strong foundations laid by rhodri glyn thomas and to deliver on the commitments set out in labour plaid assembly government deal one wales
288974 through being an assembly member for arfon i also hope i can contribute to the objectives of this government of uniting our nation spreading prosperity and building confidence in our ability to take good decisions in the interest of wales
288975 we are fortunate that he bring such wide experience with him as well as his commitment as our deputy group leader to delivering one wales
288976 alun ffred jones will have a lot to deal with in his inbox given the sudden exit of rhodri glyn from office
288977 government departments should not normally object to proposals for legislative competence on the grounds that the welsh assembly government could pursue policies that differ from england
288978 uk government departments should maintain a clear distinction between the scope of legislative competence in the proposed order and the detail of any measures likely to be brought forward as a result of the order being made the contents of likely assembly measures are
288979 we dont want to raise peoples hopes too high that there is a legislative solution to every problem in society and the economy there isnt people will always be frustrated but that doesnt really worry me because we are still in year one going into year two
288980 we get the devolution issue right and we settle it
288981 including 2 tickets on the top table a thank you from a senior party figure a chance to address the dinner with a short speech and space for pop ups
288982 that enables us to honour our promises to the people of wales
288983 well i think they realise that without us they wouldnt be in power at all
288984 reduced hospital waiting times so that by march 2008 no one was waiting longer than 22 weeks for an outpatient appointment and only 5 people were waiting over 22 weeks for admission to hospital
288985 my deepest condolences go to mr jones im afraid this shows once again that the level of service is totally unacceptable
288986 i have raised this in the past few weeks and will be asking once again for a meeting with the ambulance trust
288987 the ambulance men and women do their level best but they are simply undermanned this we cannot accept
288988 when you consider that the nearest general hospital is about an hour from the blaenau ffestiniog area and you begin to think this is a very poor service and its certainly not the kind of service you expect as rate payers
288989 while extra resources are always welcome in this particular area of south gwynedd we have more crews per head of population than there are in urban areas of wales and traditional ambulances are backed up by a fleet of rapid response vehicles
288990 there are those inside and outside the labour party in wales who question the need for such a convention at this time
288991 as someone who is currently engaged in a backbench bid to devolve more powers to the assembly on buses and coaches using the new government of wales act i have some sympathy with that opinion
288992 we are after all talking about changing the welsh devolution settlement before weve really tested the new powers
288993 reasonable to ask if we are putting the cart before the horse
288994 have to involve some real examples of why further powers are needed to make wales a better place to live and do business only then will popular support be assured in any future referendum
288995 fundamental to stimulating meaningful public debate on the crucial issue of wales law making powers
288996 we have succeeded in forming an impressive committee of members made up of talented individuals who are well placed to reach out to people across wales
288997 they will ask the big questions about the legislative process in wales and spell out to the assembly government what the people of wales have to say about law making in wales now and in the future
288998 evidence shows a cull would not help eradicate bovine tb but could make matters worse
288999 continue to promote other effective sustainable measures to tackle boving tb such as better animal husbandry and tighter controls on cattle movements
289000 it is a comprehensive programme which deals with cattle surveillance and control change to the compensation regime identifying and removing all on farm sources of infection and supporting the development and trial of bovine tb vaccines
289001 daniel storey is going to be out in four years its absolutely disgusting
289002 theres no way he should have been given a reduction in sentence there was so much evidence against him there was no way he could have pleaded not guilty
289003 because of what he did i am serving a life sentence im the prisoner
289004 there are so many things ill never do because of him ill never be the mother of the bride but when he gets out hell just live his life as normal
289005 because he repeatedly disregarded the law an innocent person has died its an insult to law abiding citizens
289006 they are so dignified they are still coming to terms with their grief and they want something good to come from this
289007 i agreed to hand in the petition which is one of the biggest i have come across in my time as an mp
289008 there was no way that guy could have pleaded anything other than guilty i dont believe he should have been given a reduction in his sentence
289009 im calling on the government to look again at the sentencing rules
289010 we need to be telling them that if they keep offending theres a real risk they could kill someone
289011 and if they do kill someone we need to let them know they will face the full weight of the law
289012 we welcomed the opportunity to comment on this issue and are delighted that the minister has clearly listened to public opinion we applaud her decision
289013 the health minister has noted some opposition to the proposals and has therefore decided not to re name the trust at this time
289014 she has been saddened by the cheap political points which have been made by some on this issue
289015 we believed that it was fitting as we remember and celebrate the inception of the nhs that the trust which serves the people that inspired it should be named after aneurin bevan
289016 i find it incredible that the labour plaid government has the brass neck to award staff such whopping bonuses when it has been failing on so many fronts over the last 12 months
289017 year after year rhodri morgan has spent more taxpayers money on spin presentation advisers and bureaucracy
289018 this is money which should go on health education and local government not to fund an administration whose policies suffocate choice enterprise and innovation
289019 these very senior staff form part of the senior civil service and their pay and bonus policies are determined by the treasury and cabinet office not by the assembly government or other devolved administrations
289020 to attract and retain high calibre staff we need to reflect market values
289021 but recent senior staff review board findings show that senior civil service salaries have fallen behind those in other areas of the public sector notably nhs and local government
289022 bonus payments are not permanent and are non pensionable in effect base pay is being held down in favour of one off payments that do not affect future levels of pay or pension
289023 far from being a money for nothing culture those who do not achieve their objectives will not get any pay increases

289030 everywhere we go here we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their many events many seem to be supported by north american churches they are intent to push their agenda on us no other lobbying groups seem to enjoy similar access or be able to have their literature prominently displayed all over the campus and at the entrance to every residence they are determined that their way is the only right way and that everyone else should follow they are not at all open to listening to us or the historic church teaching yet it is surprising that they push all these sexuality issues so intensively into the conference and then blame us for talking about them too much
289031 so i think it s pretty obvious that at least they acknowledged that
289032 and that is what campaigns are going to be like that s what every campaign that i have been involved in
289033 the one we know hes not jesus christ oh yeah hes the anti christ if the mainstream media does not call mccain out on this one it will be shameful i too am practically speechless with dismay mccain is obviously in his second childhood but what is the excuse of his staff
289034 mccain is behaving like a child a particularly obtuse rather spoiled child i sincerely hope that people aren t stupid or blind enough to fall for these tactics again

289041 there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one

289044 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
289045 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
289046 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
289047 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
289048 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form

289050 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
289051 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
289052 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
289053 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
289054 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
289055 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
289056 i guess if everybody was like me the world would be perfect
289057 this is going to be sooo hard for you youll see who really cares about you

289066 americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face

289070 i was in the part of the building that hadnt collapsed with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from downstairs to the upper floors
289071 then the explosion occurred when we opened the door of our room we saw that more than half of the building was engulfed in flames we screamed and asked for help then a few men came and rescued us i was not taken to a hospital as my injuries were not that serious
289072 the exact cause will be clear after an inspection is carried out in the area
289073 there are 10 students three of whom are in critical condition in our hospital they sustained severe burns on their bodies and leg and skull fractures
289074 as the building is situated in a rugged area it was hard for rescue teams to reach there as locals we starting bringing the students out of the debris until rescue teams arrived there were many injured
289075 it is not easy to endure such pain i extend my condolences to the whole nation the injured are under medical attention rescue teams are continuing efforts to save those under the debris
289076 we now have two things to do firstly we should do our best to help the wounded and secondly console the families of the victims
289077 this dormitory is not affiliated with our directorate such dorms are not quran courses they serve as student dormitories our dormitories are opened only after being inspected by state officials
289078 it was opened in 2004 and has a capacity to accommodate 34 students it was inspected last on may 29 2008 such inspections are carried every two years

289080 i was in the part of the building that hadnt collapsed with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from downstairs to the upper floors
289081 then the explosion occurred when we opened the door of our room we saw that more than half of the building was engulfed in flames we screamed and asked for help then a few men came and rescued us i was not taken to a hospital as my injuries were not that serious
289082 the exact cause will be clear after an inspection is carried out in the area
289083 there are 10 students three of whom are in critical condition in our hospital they sustained severe burns on their bodies and leg and skull fractures
289084 as the building is situated in a rugged area it was hard for rescue teams to reach there as locals we starting bringing the students out of the debris until rescue teams arrived there were many injured

289091 a vast area is under a haze of heavy smoke it is estimated that the fire may burn 4 000 hectares of land yet it would not be right to say how many hectares have been consumed by the fire since intense smoke is preventing us from seeing the situation on the ground helicopters are operating somewhat in the dark when dumping water we announced that those in area villages should evacuate their homes

289111 and in order to explain this to his own people he put the story out then and he has embroidered it over 12 years but there is zero truth to it i have testified to that account
289112 if holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court i want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here

289124 one of the biggest reasons weve seen a slowdown in home sales is because buyers are having difficulty obtaining mortgage funds thats why this bill is significant it increases the access to affordable stable mortgages
289125 after almost a year of distraction and disarray ankara may now be able to focus on the most pressing problems facing the country europe and the united states may now be able to treat turkey as a normal country again much will depend on whether the courts decision ushers in a period of moderation or renewed polarization and whether the akp ak party government uses its renewed freedom of action to think strategically about external policy
289126 in the event the court stepped back from this nuclear option leaving the current political constellation in place some will spec ulate that a quiet deal may have been struck between prime minister recep tayyip erdo an top generals and others in the secular establishment akp left in power but with a promise of moderation on headscarves education policy and other critical issues in the secularism debate
289127 diverse sectors in turkey may have judged that the costs of a party closure were simply too high
289128 even for hard line kemalists eager to see erdo an out of power and akp political primacy brought to an end it was never clear that a party closure would bring the desired result akp would likely have reorganized under a different name and perhaps secured an even larger mandate in new general elections
289129 the trends that have put akp in power and polarized turkish society have been gathering for decades and the resulting tensions over the future of the country will not be resolved by the courts ruling
289130 as many observers have noted akps rise has been as much about class as about religion the current reality is not so much the struggle of embattled secular elites against a more religious mass of provincial origins but rather an ongoing competition between parallel elites secular and religious cosmopolitan and provincial in various sectors
289131 with akp controlling parliament and the presidency and increasingly prominent in the state bureaucracy and the economy the partys ascendancy in turkish society will be hard to reverse
289132 erdo an and akp will now face a key test on style and substance a somewhat chastened party leadership may opt for a period of consolidation and moderation avoiding hot button issues that might reopen the legal challenge less likely but quite possibly the akp leadership and erdo an in particular will see the courts decision as a vindication and an opportunity to renew the struggle for power across multiple issues including the highly symbolic ones
289133 a good place to start would be a cabinet revision almost none of the centrist liberal deputies who were recruited for the election last year made it to the cabinet the prime ministers inner circle as well is too restricted in terms of its political views
289134 the single most potent sign that the increasing civilianization of the turkish polity and the retreat of statist elites can be converted into full scale democratization will be an energetic reengagement with the european union
289135 after the constitutional court ruling whither tayyip erdo an and the akp
289136 some sources close to the akp leader predict that erdo an will make a fresh round of gestures to appease his pro secular opponents he may begin by reshuffling his cabinet
289137 they argue that erdo an is unlikely to be tamed by his latest run in with the pro secular establishment in this view the courts decision will have only reinforced the prime ministers sense of invincibility sources close to erdo an have long complained of an increasingly authoritarian streak the prime minister brooks no dissent they say and scolds associates who dare to express it he rules the akp with an iron fist
289138 despite occasional statements that call into question his commitment to secularism there is no real evidence that erdo an seeks to introduce shariah rule prime minister erdo ans excesses are best explained by the lack of a credible opposition secular or otherwise to the akp

289178 whats the correlation between desire to serve and growth in love and knowledge of jesus
289179 in our bringing new people into places of service within the church we must be sensitive to their needs people serve with different motivations obligation duty to please others to find test gifts or calling to glorify god etc we dont want to stifle their growth with an overload of responsibilities yet we dont want to keep them out of community by protecting them from service either i think we ought to be mindful of how those who are serving our being served really the question is are those who are serving being mentored and maturing as believers as they grow in their affections for christ serving him moves from being a duty to delight
289180 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics

289212 kozens has some really good speed at running back if i had those running backs and that line i think id run the ball and see what happens we know if we cant stop the run were going to get a heavy dose of that weve told our front seven that
289213 we could run 80 percent spread and 20 percent i or we could go 80 percent i and 20 percent spread we just dont know right now well see how they react to both sets
289214 size wise i do like the way we match up this year
289215 i really like our two big tight ends adam chicoine burlington and andrew baker rutland
289216 in practice we looked really polished were ready were game ready
289217 its so good to get this win at last it could not be better
289218 i had not win an event since newquay in 2007 and i gave everything i had to get this one despite the massive conditions it was really hard out there and testing with strong currents i want to thank all my family sponsor and my brother who shapes my boards
289219 the support here is amazing and i had some great time with all the girls
289220 people are so nice and supported me during these two hard days so stoked to take a win in portugal it is special for me
289221 i am going to go up in the ratings and it is a big relief before things get back on with the asp womens world tour in france i needed to get this confidence back and i did it i will enjoy a two week break at home to regroup before coming back to europe and hope for another big result
289222 i was just exhausted after two close heats in the quarters and semis
289223 the waves picked up every minute and these conditions were just so hard i am happy to be alive and jacqueline silva got that one wave right at the beginning and nothing better came through during the heat so there wasnt much i could do it was a bit scary out there
289224 i needed to stop thinking about points and i really want to enjoy my time on tour
289225 it is the first time i come to such a big event without pressure or thinking of points and if i do the maths it worked out perfectly my best result this year
289226 i got hammered pretty bad on that last wave and felt close to drowning so i am happy to be ok i almost got knocked out in my first heat so to end up 3rd is a good result i am cool with that
289227 some new girls are surfing really well but when it comes to chunky tough conditions the asp top 17 experience makes a big difference for sure cant wait to be back to europe in a few weeks
289228 it was really a tough day and the conditions were hard
289229 we could not hear anything out there and i was stoked to make the semifinals because my quarter was a very close one i had a perfect time in portugal
289230 there is not too much pressure on me because it is my first year on the wqs
289231 i have been thinking about the ratings a bit and i would really love to make it to the dream tour this year but the last two major events in hawaii will be crucial
289232 it was so close but rebecca woods got this last minute ride and made it
289233 we had some good fun out there and the waves were not too big yet so i enjoyed my time out i am still bummed with the loss
289234 when the convening authority reviewed those facts and circumstances they made the determination that they were such that they wanted to authorize they felt it appropriate that a panel have the death penalty as an available punishment
289235 while approving a sentence of death for a member of our armed services is a serious and difficult decision for a commander in chief the president believes the facts of this case leave no doubt that the sentence is just and warranted
289236 iraq and afghanistan remind us that military success alone is insufficient to achieve victory
289237 we must not forget our hard learned lessons or allow the important soft power capabilities developed because of them to atrophy or even disappear
289238 a whole of government approach is only possible when every government department and agency understands the core competencies roles missions and capabilities of its partners and works together to achieve common goals
289239 from our point of view such an agenda would be counterproductive wasteful and dysfunctional
289240 it would send exactly the wrong message to those nations who are striving to build democracies with civilian oversight and to be able to partner with us
289241 far too often we find our military assuming missions for which its not best placed
289242 and while weve filled these gaps admirably i believe theres no substitute for civilian expertise and experience whether its building schools advising city councils or engaging in other activities in complex operational environments
289243 broadly speaking when it comes to americas engagement with the rest of the world it is important that the military is and is clearly seen to be in a supporting role to civilian agencies
289244 is to adapt to new realities while preserving those core competencies and institutional traits that have made them so successful in the past
289245 the main objective there is the pursuit of al qaida to remove them from their hideouts there and continue to keep them off balance
289246 mosul is a piece of valuable real estate for al qaida
289247 they want to hold on to mosul because its their entryway to syria and it facilitates a lot of the flow of foreign fighters and money to finance al qaida
289248 in anbar theres still a viable lethal al qaida threat
289249 and that is really the focus of the security forces out there
289250 thats a key security issue that we cant take our eye off and that we have got to continue to focus on another one would be the structured continued process of turning over security for provinces to the iraqi government that would be a good thing to watch and were making good progress on that
289251 five hundred and sixty five voter registration centers are open people are registering to vote
289252 i am very encouraged by the fact that speaker mashadani has called them in
289253 theyre going to wrestle with it on sunday all parties really i think have an interest in solving this now because as they move forward with the elections and as they move forward with solving the kirkuk issue its going to be very beneficial to the country in terms of moving forward economic development
289254 the people are by and large rejecting the violence whether its al qaida or iranian backed special groups this indiscriminate violence thats killing innocent iraqis
289255 the iraqis have really out of hand rejected that and are not supporting any elements that really participated in that
289256 its very encouraging time now that were kind of shifting into the political and economical development phase of the counterinsurgency

289270 the thing that should save layoffs is that partner attorneys in all firms boutiques included are working 10 to 15 percent harder and longer
289271 we have three major transactions in the firm right now each larger than 250 million
289272 year over year im expecting that well be slightly up in the 3 to 6 percent range
289273 but revenues will overall be lower because we have fewer attorneys
289274 it has become approximately 20 percent of the firms home building related transactions and looks to grow into a much larger percentage

289299 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
289300 we are dedicated to preserving our objective to become a major player of nuclear in great britain
289301 i am disappointed we thought it was a good deal edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder it is now a matter for both boards to see how to proceed
289302 the future development of britains nuclear energy capability is at stake the public is reduced to bystanders witnessing the failure of the governments market led strategy for keeping the lights on
289303 he has got to get a grip and put the interest of the uk public who foot the bill before the self interest of the shareholders
289304 theyre marketing their services to not only foreign governments but to fortune 500 corporations
289305 this is a company that has been accused of murdering iraqi civilians
289306 of shooting the bodyguard to the iraqi vice president of causing blowback attacks on united states troops of hurting the morale of the united states military that has cost united states taxpayers over a billion dollars for its operations in iraq
289307 a private cia essentially called total intelligence solutions and the man running total intelligence solutions is j cofer black hes a thirty year veteran of the central intelligence agency he also was the guy who ran the cias extraordinary rendition program the government sanctioned kidnap and torture program
289308 his thirty year cia career his network of contacts his knowledge that was gained through his work in the most sensitive areas of the united states government is now on the open market for hire
289309 you have a lot of traditional conservatives who are outraged at what they see as the degradation of the united states armed forces this has everything to do with the future of war making and global stability
289310 gather your things we have a long journey ahead i will fill you in on the details at midnight meet me at the blackhorse pubb

289331 they are telling me theyd been led to believe they didnt have any choice about who they can treat
289332 some managers are interpreting the rules too restrictively and are saying unless someone is at deaths door you shouldnt treat them unless they pay
289333 three of my clients including a child have died after treatment was refused
289334 well never know whether they would have died anyway or not but they werent given the chance to survive
289335 escandaloso o espa o que est o dando para a liberta o de ingrid betancourt
289336 ela e sua assessora e companheira de aventuras clara rojas libertada em janeiro deste ano s o os nicos pol ticos que agiram para serem seq estrados
289337 na poca da captura ela tinha ido com a assessora intencionalmente para um local em que havia esse risco
289338 milhares j foram seq estrados ao longo dos anos agora v rias centenas est o sofrendo em poder da farc mas s se fala dela
289339 o povo colombiano t o ignorante que pode at eleg la mas ela francesa tem dupla cidadania por que escolheu fazer pol tica e concorrer a presidente da col mbia por que ela n o concorre na fran a com nicolas sarkozy
289340 a col mbia n o gosta da organiza o s o um bando de assassinos seq estradores e narcotraficantes
289341 depois da igreja cat lica e de uribe a maior praga da col mbia
289342 toda a classe pol tica na am rica latina s pensa em seus pr prios interesses quando n o est claramente envolvida com o crime e com a corrup o
289343 a col mbia o nico pa s que tem guerrilha e por isso estamos na extrema direita quem elegeu uribe foram as farc for as armadas revolucion rias da col mbia o grupo que a fez ref m se n o existissem as farc n o existiria uribe os colombianos votaram em uribe porque est o at o pesco o com as farc
289344 diverg ncia fundamental com ele a natureza da guerrilha uribe concebe o problema colombiano como uma crise de viol ncia de seguran a que cria um mal estar social eu penso o contr rio que porque h um mal estar social que h viol ncia
289345 os espa os t m que se abrir naturalmente se vejo em algum momento que bom para a col mbia que eu esteja a a estarei
289346 and not seen any evidence of it that weve reached the assumption that it is not a viable threat
289347 must come together to shape it or others will shape it for them
289348 who the f is this paging me at five forty six in the mornin crac
289349 bands who have crazed computer equipped teen girl squads as their fanbases
289350 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
289351 i think its accurate to say that iraqi and coalition forces control the vast majority of the country
289352 that is of course a major change from even just a year ago
289353 you talk to people iraqis and they just say never again we almost destroyed ourselves
289354 there is almost a kind of embarrassment over it how could we iraqis do that
289355 despite the challenges facing all banks today the current environment also presents opportunities for strong institutions like suntrust to expand our client base
289356 troubles in the subprime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
289357 i doubt were even a third of the way through it
289358 a real recovery wont happen until late 2010 or early 2011 a lot of the bills from the credit bubble havent come due yet
289359 we probably have at least another year to two years to go in this process
289360 were a very global firm operating in 120 countries our concern is that were beginning to see some of the same characteristics in europe as weve seen in the u s
289361 overall economic pressure is increasing that leads to tightness in credit and pressure on financial institutions we see it everyday with our clients
289362 the consumer is dealing with their homes going down in value and their stock portfolios falling theyre being hit on the asset side of their balance sheet
289363 theyre also suffering on the income side too with wages stagnating and food and energy prices climbing
289364 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being at heart
289365 i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
289366 i love you i miss you so much and remember youre always a princess
289367 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
289368 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
289369 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
289370 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
289371 it will take a few days for the dust to settle
289372 the government must force british energy to make available their sites in order that international consortiums can build the next generation of nuclear power stations
289373 we do not have the luxury of time failure to act now will result in huge problems over the next 10 years with the uk reliant on imported gas and oil a situation that would be an environmental economic and political disaster
289374 a push for more nuclear power would scupper the uk renewable energy industry and by doing so cancel out the prospect of creating hundreds of thousands of british green collar jobs
289375 in real life she had never seen any woman arrive to breakfast in a silk satin and lace neglig e every one did on the films to see one of these lovely visions in the flesh was almost more than she could believe
289376 i knew it the minute i laid eyes on you i knew you were the kind of person to be relied on flattered bewildered excited miss pettigrew made for the door she knew that she was not a person to be relied upon
289377 a beechams powder very good i understand for nerves stomach and rheumatism
289378 i dont like to jump to conclusions but i think there was a little jew in him he wasnt quite english and well i do think when it comes to marriage its safer to stick to your own nationality
289379 we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
289380 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy
289381 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
289382 no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal
289383 others from president clintons team are in a hurry to see me dead
289384 the offer was as follows i must withdraw not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena
289385 holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
289386 its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
289387 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
289388 mr holbrookes wish for my disappearance is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
289389 the clergy are like manure excellent when spread all over the country while doing their work but when gathered together in a heap they stink
289390 but it must be a matter of unimportance because i cannot recall the slightest offence that might be charged against me
289391 so i cant confirm if you are charged with an offence only that you are under arrest proclaiming your innocence does not redound well upon you now i suggest you go about your business at the bank
289392 but the warders are corrupt and this trial is unjust
289393 for in this dystopian world nothing is at it seems and even the gallery are court officials
289394 why have you come on a day when theres no one sitting
289395 how would it be if fra lein b rstner were to vanish as mysteriously as she appeared
289396 the great advantage of an unfinished novel stitched together after your death
289397 is that everything can seem far more symbolic than you intended and generations of critics can read almost anything they like into it
289398 if you hadnt spoken out against them in court i wouldnt have to punish them
289399 and i understand the futility of fighting the system if i wasnt in such a hurry to feel alienated by the deputy manager of the bank i would offer to be birched in their place
289400 and as im a woman i must find you so bewitching that i have to have sex with you immediately
289401 i was discussing your case with the examining magistrate and your failure to join us did not go unnoticed
289402 it is true that i too can go on for pages about the opacity of the law
289403 and i may be able to put in a good word with a lower judge but my real function is to discourse wryly on the three possible acquittal verdicts none of which will offer you satisfaction
289404 you too are a court official and every building is a court building
289405 as i have described for the best part of 30 pages the law is infinitely serpentine and you cannot hope to win without me and dont be disturbed by leni making eyes at that man pretending to be a dog hes a client of mine called block whose case has been going on for five years and leni adores the accused
289406 if you go to the cathedral to meet a client who is not going to turn up
289407 you can meet a priest instead who will deliver yet another tangential parable on the implacability of the law
289408 i know that i really ought to be drawing the whole thing out for another four years or so and that the legal process has barely got under way but i cant stand it a moment longer just allow me one last fleeting reference to fra lein b rstner and let the warders stab me through the heart let me feel the point of pointlessness
289409 the chancellor is looking at all of these options sensibly and fairly as he always does and he will come forward in due course with his proposals
289410 weve got to encourage very significant investment in our power generation system over the next 10 to 15 years
289411 we have got to have a fiscal regulatory climate that encourages all of that investment because quite simply it will go elsewhere if there is not confidence in the uk market
289412 they could offer another 50p a share and still find themselves in the same position
289413 a huge concentration of electricity generation in the hands of one supplier over a quarter of the market in one supplier
289414 the government does have to get on with creating the climate in which these new nuclear power stations are built
289415 this is the first time this species has been identified in the parisian region
289416 when its hot the river sides are very busy especially around the ile saint louis and the ile de la cit
289417 lots of passers by throw themselves in without realising they are exposing themselves to strong currents and a significant amount of traffic with more than 500 boats every day
289418 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
289419 fantastic news this trial has gone on for an extremely long time and it has built up the pressure on them they are very very happy indeed to have been found innocent
289420 we extend our sympathies to those affected by this incident the conclusion of this civilian case means that the army can now consider whether any internal administrative action should follow
289421 as most new yorkers have done i have given serious and generous thought to the state of my apartment should i get killed during the day
289422 number of sloane square and or sloane ranger jokes made by acutely observant british people 457
289423 she also wrote the cover story for the worst selling issue of maxim in the magazines history
289424 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
289425 at least forty quid a night for special branch officers to risk their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa
289426 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
289427 he is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
289428 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened
289429 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
289430 it is like a bad comedy my relations with the protection officers were cordial and i am still friendly with a few of them at the end of my nine years of protection they held a reception for me i had a lot of sympathy and understanding from the police our relationship was the exact opposite of what has been written i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
289431 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
289432 i dont even want to dignify that with a response
289433 it is extraordinary to have had to go through an experience as unpleasant as that period of sequestration to have somebody to try to cash in giving a false portrait to a publisher a very senior member of the scotland yard protection service telephoned me to apologise and said the police force felt humiliated and embarrassed
289434 police officers thought if i was incurring costs it would be fair to contribute to that that was an offer made to me by senior officers of special branch it was never a request of mine to say that i was trying to extort money from them for my protection is an obscene distortion of the truth
289435 your conduct serves to increase the risk to him rushdie and to his publisher without the slightest public interest justification i invite you to mitigate the damage you have already done by withdrawing the book and removing the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
289436 apart from anything else what he has written makes the police look bad the idea that the police would treat somebody they are supposed to protect in this way is very disturbing the idea that i was so unpleasant to them they locked me up is totally made up
289437 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
289438 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
289439 probably acting on their own and going against official policy
289440 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
289441 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
289442 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organisation on pakistani soil
289443 bibi is likely to be prime minister after the next elections
289444 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
289445 but its impossible to predict whats going to happen there are too many variables
289446 has a prime ministerial aura and experience in executive positions precisely what livni lacks
289447 who the fuck does he think he is whos the fucking superpower here
289448 as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated until a new israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace
289449 savvy politician mindful of the sound bite and always ready to use it he tended to impress and befriend his interlocutors often by stretching or hiding part of the truth
289450 netanyahu believes that the economic sphere is one where we can make quick tangible progress create more jobs and generate growth
289451 that may yield the kind of political payoffs that could further political negotiations
289452 but bibi may in fact be more sane on this issue than mofaz or barak
289453 they dont believe in it any more people will vote for bibi because they say if there is no peace we might as well have a strong leader
289454 a sweet explosion of all the sugars off me off him
289455 released a stampede of wildebeest like a load of extras told to charge or kids out of school
289456 nothing in this book should be considered accurate or reliable
289457 at the turn of the century when opium and cocaine were outlawed yeah both used to be legal woohoo woohoo and alcohol and prostitution became the areas primary business
289458 we want the nobodies the same nobodies who gave the order to the other nobodies with the machine guns to kill the nobodies kneeling in the snow and mud
289459 but perhaps a man will always be a nobody to the man pointing a pistol at the back of his head
289460 approaching ivor gurney in fictional form is a clever way of sidestepping the complex problems that await his biographers
289461 he has been variously diagnosed as bipolar manic depressive schizophrenic and shell shocked
289462 a work of fiction is not to be held to historical account but it is a pity in a novel to present a gurney who could not possibly have written as in reality he did at that time
289463 the narrative turns on the readers hopes for gurney once a writer and musician of concentrated subtlety now a flickering simulacrum of his earlier self
289464 the most hopeful sections are all concerned with bee keeping and you gradually sense the emergence of a metaphor
289465 edric takes this powerful metaphor and spins it into a fiction of extraordinary resonance
289466 robert gildea is an accomplished interpreter of this convulsive era
289467 yet at times his scholarly book becomes a rather unconvincing mix of analysis and narrative
289468 is in the sections on social and cultural history his method is to zoom in on an anecdote and then zoom out again to the broader picture
289469 although it bulges with certifiable fact it also gives a face to many neglected individuals and makes wonderful use of fictional characters
289470 a triumph there are however moments when gildeas diligence is his own worst enemy and sometimes i felt as though i was at risk of being crushed under a tottering edifice of fact
289471 as an essay in group biography her book presents an authoritative portrait of a genuinely revolutionary era
289472 we owe rather more to those goggle eyed periwig wearers in charing cross road than we care to imagine
289473 field has a native gift for historical retrieval so that we see the past in close up as it were as well as in wide view
289474 one of the most important productions the club generated was the literary magazine
289475 addison and steele evolved an easy conversational style of writing and perhaps more significantly invented a distinctive mode of manners which they marketed as peculiarly english
289476 suns dying on a string of sweat glistening backs stumbling all over cane piece track passing distant mountain ridges
289477 in england the victorian poet elizabeth barrett struggles to meet her fathers conditions for his love and approval
289478 i am black i am black and yet god made me they say
289479 cyaan wipe we past away cyaan wipe we past away
289480 only you isaac and warmth of you arm round me shoulder lying lip to lip you body warmth salt of you breath
289481 forced to wear an iron muzzle in the kitchen to prevent her eating on the job her lips cracked her mouth dehydrated her tongue swelled her gums bled
289482 but oh how i longed for those cloudy grey skies how i longed for the incessant drizzle and harsh wind slapping my ears how i longed for my snug winter woollies and sturdy wooden clogs how i longed for england how i longed for home
289483 even though i was quite far away then i was terrified
289484 afterwards there were terrible downpours but no one wanted to stay in the buildings i can imagine the fear in sichuan
289485 to write even in secret was to risk ones life
289486 it was only during this period when literature became utterly impossible that i came to comprehend why it was so essential
289487 i heard the news on the radio that people were gunned down and right then i knew i was looking at exile
289488 immortalised the memories of a nation suffering from forced amnesia my own memories flooded back reading him
289489 both a linguistic innovator and a writer of integrity whose work constantly reaffirms the importance of the individual over the collective he was one of the first writers of the post mao era to absorb developments in western literature and philosophy and meld them with chinese classical traditions to create a new kind of drama and fiction
289490 sprawling self indulgent take on the horrors of political oppression
289491 fragile man who has managed not to be crushed by authority and to speak to the world in his own voice
289492 tranquil yet engaged presence a very composed mild mannered man but a passionate reader and artist
289493 whirlwind i was carried away and it was difficult to organise my life very soon after i fell ill and had two big heart operations one after the other it was because of the fatigue and pressure i became an ornament on the political scene
289494 used for political purposes and thus has lost its authority
289495 campaigned for years for the nobel prize to be awarded to one of their state sanctioned writers so they were furious when it went to a political exile
289496 it was criticised by the pro democracy activists because it failed to show the students in a heroic light
289497 many intellectuals feel themselves to be supermen who are spokesmen for the people
289498 but in my opinion theyre to be pitied under maos dictatorship these poor sheep suffered the same fate as everyone else i dont want to be a strong hero who can save society i just want to save myself
289499 well to do protected childhood and my parents were very open minded which was rare its like a lost paradise
289500 even though she wasnt really an intellectual she was sent away for re education just like all the others who were not from communist red families
289501 children of high up party executives who felt like mowing down and killing old people like their parents other youths reacted and set up a rebellious red guard faction all young people to protect themselves had to join one or the other but once i got in i saw it wasnt really a way out experience has taught me that any kind of political grouping is oppressive its the blind mass that crushes the individual
289502 influenced a generation of writers by introducing them to the concepts of stream of consciousness surrealism and black humour
289503 the elder brother of the small band of dissident beijing artists and writers that i belonged to he could speak foreign languages and had travelled abroad we all looked up to him
289504 in a nuanced way the psychology of a bad individual it heralded a new kind of drama in opposition to the one dimensional propaganda of the cultural revolution
289505 then i was censored by others thats when i decided to write just for myself
289506 after bus stop they threatened to send me back to work camp then this shadow was found on my lungs i went back to my hometown and had more tests and by a miracle it had disappeared
289507 if you want to do anything do it now without compromise or concession because you have only one life
289508 i was looking for a place of refuge it was also a spiritual and cultural quest to find the origin of chinese culture the source that had not yet been polluted by politics
289509 the novel in chinese sensibility is 2 000 years old
289510 its the language of real people from the streets the non official version
289511 tiny history of a few individuals in a novel cant be revised or manipulated it goes to the heart of human nature if its still read its still valuable
289512 literature cant merely be an expression of self that would be unbearable
289513 you have to be critical not just of society and others but of yourself each subject has three pronouns i you and he or she
289514 if youre not perfectly conscious of yourself that self can be tyrannical in relationship to others anyone can become a tyrant thats why no one can be a superman you have to go beyond yourself with a third eye self awareness because the one thing you cannot flee is yourself thats why greek tragedy is still the tragedy of human beings today
289515 when the company asked me to change the text i understood what they wanted there was no american style hero
289516 i said no even the chinese communist party couldnt make me change a play why should i accept correction from america
289517 cinepoem or modern fable neither fiction nor autobiography nor documentary
289518 since childhood id dreamed of making a film but producers in france and germany wanted to make commercial films with chinoiserie i refused
289519 or even weekends because freedom of expression is so precious to me
289520 i could make a living so i could write books that didnt sell much i always understood that literature cant be a trade its a choice
289521 infused with the still reflective quality of zen buddhism that i think he strives to achieve in his writing
289522 burden of painful memories and how they corrupt the present and destroy oneself and those around one
289523 tragedy that a writer of such calibre is condemned in his own homeland
289524 stubborn personal view of our history the kids born after the 1980s know nothing about the past the tragedy and sorrow of my fathers generation and how society dedicated to a collective dream ruined people and invaded their lives
289525 impossible to say freely what you thought even in your family
289526 everything people say in those circumstances is false everybody is wearing a mask its in literature that true life can be found its under the mask of fiction that you can tell the truth
289527 without isms is neither nihilism nor eclecticism nor is it egotism or solipsism it opposes totalitarian dictatorship but also opposes the inflation of the self to god or superman it hates seeing other people trampled on like dog shit without isms detests politics and does not take part in politics but is not opposed to other people who do if people want to get involved in politics let them go right ahead what without isms opposes is the foisting of a particular brand of politics on to the individual by means of abstract collective names such as the people the race or the nation
289528 the only child who is not an orphan a fact that has disfigured my family
289529 i dont seem to have any reason to be here at all i just sit and look at juns wet body
289530 i wanted to savour every one of ries tears to run my tongue over the damp festering vulnerable places in her heart and open the wounds even wider
289531 yoko ogawa is able to give expression to the most subtle workings of human psychology
289532 why not try to save that tax when taxes in florence are about 8 percent
289533 its a great opportunity to do a lot of shopping and get a lot of stuff that you typically wouldnt buy
289534 were driving value in the store theres a lot of stuff that shoppers can get for a good buy so not only do you save a little bit as far as sale and price cut items but they get to save that tax
289535 the cool thing about it is if they apply for a target red card and get approved they save on taxes 10 percent from being approved and the store gives 1 percent of the total sales to a school of their choice
289536 i guess they shoppers might buy some just to get a head start on them but well really start to see those things sell really quickly around the 22 or 23 of august
289537 e coli may seem like an odd choice as a guide to life if the only place youve heard about it is in news reports of food poisoning
289538 it is just a matter of time before i am killed
289539 i dont like to let the warders out of my sight i feel there is a contract out on my head and one of the prisoners is just waiting for the right time to strike a few come up to me in the dinner queue and say watch your back mate they are after you lots of the prisoners liked jill and blamed me for murdering her
289540 lots have come up to me and said we know you didnt do it murder jill
289541 we dont know why he has placed himself on the list
289542 i would be very surprised if theres not a claim for compensation for the eight years of suffering he has had to endure
289543 the secretary of state decides whether compensation is payable at present there is no limit to the amount of compensation the assessor can award but when section 61 of the criminal justice act 2008 is commenced the limits will be 500 000 for less than 10 years in jail previous convictions are not taken into account when deciding eligibility but once eligibility has been confirmed the independent assessor may make a reduction in the compensation award
289544 fantastic news this trial has gone on for an extremely long time and it has built up the pressure on them they are very very happy indeed to have been found innocent
289545 we extend our sympathies to those affected by this incident the conclusion of this civilian case means that the army can now consider whether any internal administrative action should follow
289546 it was in fact no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by george than that it had come from some other source
289547 if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial there is no certainty that they would have found barry george guilty for this reason his conviction had to be quashed
289548 he described to me that he can be aware of whats going on around him but he just cant respond
289549 i am sure mr george has inherited a gene or genes which pre dispose him to epilepsy or cognitive impairment
289550 measures of his ability to plan and organise himself and to carry out or execute various things
289551 its not good for us the fact the jury took 13 hours to acquit means they were utterly convinced he was not guilty
289552 the fact he has previous bad character will help protect the organistaion and weather the storm
289553 are they really going to say to hamish campbell were going to disembowel your investigation and see where it went wrong it probably needs an external force to reinvestigate
289554 the clergy are like manure excellent when spread all over the country while doing their work but when gathered together in a heap they stink
289555 quando as pessoas podem registrar um evento que est acontecendo isso ajuda nas investiga es
289556 it could have come from the suits or trousers in miss dandos wardrobe or from her fiance alan farthings wardrobe
289557 it could have been contaminated by people walking past on the path
289558 i would not be confident in putting any weight on the fibre
289559 the television station was owned and run by the milosevic family and was deliberately targeted by nato using a cruise missile because it was seen as the main purveyor of serbian state propaganda jill dando by this stage had become one of the if not the face s of the bbc
289560 the murder certainly hadnt been planned and carried out in just three days
289561 the first one you had yesterday the next one will be tony hall chief executive for bbc news and responsible for coverage of the kosovo conflict
289562 in 60 years there has not once been a claim of responsibility for an assassination carried out by east european secret services
289563 clinging to its hill like a tipsy man to a lamp post
289564 the road is extremely narrow and if you have to reverse down this is potentially an accident waiting to happen
289565 this is a basic service it is unbelievable that we are just being cut off
289566 i dont see how i can continue to work from home what business is going to come and set up here if they cant be sure theyll get their post
289567 this is the thin end of the wedge for remote communities everywhere and it must be stopped it raises real concerns for all our rural services
289568 he should have rollled up his sleeves and laid into the tories instead we got a lecture on oil prices and how difficult everything is
289569 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
289570 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
289571 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance
289572 why did you never come and see me before magellan how long have i known you
289573 im sorry lawrence i was afraid to come i thought i could handle it myself
289574 you didnt want my friendship you didnt want to acknowledge me
289575 im sorry but now i need your help lawrence please help me those animals are running wild saying whatever they want insulting each other in the comments section help me lawrence
289576 you want me to delete them that is not justice let them batter each other senseless that will be justice enough
289577 when we first dreamed up the idea of building tornado in 1990
289578 we entertained the notion that a whole generation of locospotters about a third of boys in any school class in the 60s and a few of their sisters were grown up and many with decent jobs all the a1s had been scrapped so we reckoned we could tempt mature enthusiasts into shelling out for one
289579 is that the project has involved people from all walks of life old and new technologies and its nurtured tremendous affection bordering on love

289582 if id have asked he would have given him to me
289583 he would be great in italy because he is always interested in different types of football
289584 he loves knowing about football and thats why he wouldnt have much of a problem adapting
289585 everything was well and i got on very well with him
289586 he had a huge enthusiasm for chelsea and a great desire to take chelsea right to the top
289587 but now its four years on and i dont know how much enthusiasm he still has for football and how much money he still wants to spend
289588 i know he wants to take chelsea to the top but it depends if hes still willing to spend more money
289589 im very proud of my third season where we did well without spending a single pound
289590 that year we came fourth in the premier league and also got into the champions league
289591 and you have to remember chelsea were a failing team before
289592 but the following year was something that will stay with me all my life my last year was something that will never be repeated
289593 i was like ill take this one and that one and that one it was amazing
289594 because now what matters is that you win not that you are rebuilding
289595 now you dont have time to rebuild anymore new overseas owners come in and they want to win immediately
289596 if hes here saturday morning i guess hes with us
289597 the big thing is weve got so many guys who have worked so hard
289598 i talked with shawns family it was a family decision that he move back home with his mom i support that 100 percent and wish shawn the best the big thing for us is weve got so many guys here who have worked hard in the summer to step up in so many different spots
289599 everybodys concerned about what the project is going to cost and were trying to do everything we can to build a good system but minimize the cost to property owners
289600 i will work from the assumption that there might be a retrial and that it is likely to be in the new year
289601 an essential preparatory step in the plan to bring death and destruction to the heart of the uk
289602 there is insufficient evidence and a fatal weakness in the crowns case
289603 i have never seen jill dando in the flesh in any shape or form
289604 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
289605 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
289606 at the first appeal the court of appeal considered it to be a sound identification case whilst at the second appeal the court allowed the appeal on a very narrow point concerning the firearms discharge residue which was not used this time but ordered that a retrial should take place
289607 if david is so interested in the domestic agenda and attacking the tories then this is the perfect job for him
289608 we have got to stop sounding miserable about ourselves and sounding as if we have been treated unfairly we have not been treated unfairly we are not doing well enough and thats what the voters have said
289609 its the right decision for the whale unfortunately its not the outcome people would want but its the right decision for the animal
289610 its sick and distressed and it has come in for a second time it has chosen to strand both times
289611 we now know its not a navigational error but it has stranded for a reason it is sick
289612 the fire brigade turned up with several appliances they went down with loads of hoses and connected them from the mill pond and started pumping water over the whale
289613 its very very unusual we have had seals before but never a whale
289614 you can see it from a distance stuck on the flats i just hope they manage to get it back into the water
289615 luckily we dont get many things like this happening on the south coast
289616 a lot of people cannot quite believe that we have a whale down here
289617 they are willing it to survive theres a certain empathy with wild animals particularly whales and dolphins we have a special relationship with them
289618 the blood test results indicate thats why it was stranded in the first place
289619 its pure snobbery however good a horsewoman i may be im also a glamour model that embarrassed the organisers
289620 eliza doolittle went to the races with henry higgins after a few elocution lessons in pretty woman julia roberts went to the polo straight from sunset boulevard but in the 21st century we have become even more class ridden unless you are a toff or an aspiring actress they dont want you
289621 polo should be for people who love horses not a media charade it should be about the sport horses are a wonderful hobby one that gets you outside and keeps you fit they should be for everyone little girls glamour girls working class girls like me no one should be excluded
289622 there are some facts that have been misrepresented chinawhite didnt ever receive any money from katie the claim that we took her money and then decided she wasnt good enough just isnt true
289623 shes also saying she gave us 6 000 but tables only cost 5 000 she gave the money to a third party to book a table for her and they were unsuccessful because the tables were already sold out theyre clearly going to rip her off a grand so i hope she gets a refund
289624 im the one whos been visiting him we can tell just by talking to him that he has had nothing to do with this also there is no evidence to link him to any of this nobody is able to say the person who i saw leaving the scene was barry george
289625 it is most unlikely that we will be able to get lugovoi but we can try to make sure that we dont have another litvinenko
289626 send a strong message that this kind of thing will not be tolerated
289627 litvinenko was a former member of the fsb and he became a very unpopular man i assume as a result of that his death was either officially sanctioned or that some faction or other of the fsb tried to get him
289628 if he litvinenko had drunk the whole cup of tea he would have died instantly it is only because he sipped it that he lingered and polonium was detected
289629 i have been here 44 years and i have never seen an accident
289630 there are tracks like these everywhere in the dales its really a money saving operation because the postman has to work overtime to get all the way round his round
289631 where are the health and safety issues it is a council road so if it is too dangerous for the postman then surely it is too dangerous for the people that live here
289632 if we send off for something off the internet how can we sign for things if they are in a box in richmond how do we know they will be secure
289633 if we had been consulted we might have been a bit more amenable but the high handed way we have been treated is appalling
289634 you will only ever hear kind things about jill because there were only ever kind things to say about her
289635 getting married this autumn was certainly an additional incentive to spend rather more time in england
289636 just because ive got blonde hair and havent been to bosnia doesnt mean im a bimbo i am still a serious journalist
289637 you were drawn to this conspiracy out of greed and a desire for street cred and glory you have not brought glory to your family which is well respected here and in pakistan you have brought shame and disgrace
289638 we are experiencing an increase in bookings as people are choosing to boycott the continent for many reasons such as the strong euro and the fuel surcharges that are significantly affecting air and sea travel
289639 why would a family subject themselves to what is typically an awful experience at our airports with long queues delays and excess luggage charges they can simply fill up the car with everything they need for a family break and arrive feeling relaxed and ready for a fun holiday holidaying in the uk can offer an irresistible combination of convenience value for money and flexibility
289640 we are really delighted we finally have justice i want to thank everybody who has supported us throughout these years
289641 we have been fighting for many years and now we need to get back together as a family we hope that the police will look again into the murder of jill dando
289642 i am overwhelmed i want to thank my family my legal team my medical team and all the people who have supported me at belmarsh whitemoor and manchester prisons and all my supporters across the uk
289643 throughout the trial he did not dare to get his hopes up and continually said to me in the dock he believed he would be convicted
289644 his eyes filled with tears and he took a very deep breath
289645 i would be surprised if there was not a claim for compensation for the eight years of suffering plans are already afoot
289646 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered we would like to thank the members of public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those that gave evidence in court
289647 will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
289648 where else was he to go he had no discernable interests anyone knew of and his dad had made more than god its not as if he was going to make any more
289649 they would be out quite a lot and then before you know it theyd drop completely off the radar and not resurface for months
289650 one law for the rich and another for the poor
289651 when i heard about the law lords ruling that was the first time in six years that i actually cried
289652 id pretty much managed to keep it together all these years but when i saw my girlfriend and mother crying i just couldnt any more
289653 i genuinely believe that we are the 51st state you see it everywhere you go not just our foreign policy but in our schools our hospitals and now our courts the british government simply bends over backwards for america
289654 it was more like probing snooping around and leaving messages what hackers call hactivism attack suggests some sort of malicious intent which there simply wasnt
289655 its a classic case of america using a sledgehammer to crack a nut
289656 there was a british hacker like me in the 1990s called matthew bevan and america labelled him the greatest threat to national security since adolf hitler i think they were hugely embarrassed that i got in i remember one reporter in the states telling me that the only major damage i had done was to egos of the top military brass
289657 i think about what i did every day if only i could build a time machine i would when i look back at my hacking days i was a completely different person i hardly slept washed or changed my clothes
289658 seeing what this has done to my family is the hardest part
289659 like any woman lucy wants to settle down and have kids but we can hardly do that with the threat of prison hanging over me
289660 i think if it came down to it and i had to spend time in a us jail i would survive but it would be really tough all the time you hear about the rapes and beatings just the other month i read an amnesty international report about how prison guards were using their stuns guns too much as someone accused of supposedly attacking their country i cant imagine id be too welcome either
289661 resposta s a es agressivas de tbilisi ser muito dura
289662 even accepting all of his allegations as true neither on the law asserted nor on the facts alleged can it be established that justice butler was disqualified by law from participating in this case
289663 the motion should not come as a surprise however given the predicament in which the movant finds himself and the frequency of similar attacks on other members of the court
289664 sometimes these well publicized demands have caused a justice to withdraw from a case because the justice is not in a position to answer false allegations without appearing to comment on pending litigation
289665 this was not a little whimper whimper pay attention to me cry
289666 she has colic i can give you some antacids to try but you should know that nothing really helps
289667 i took the prenatal birthing classes with my husband and no mention was made of colic let alone what to do about it
289668 my obstetrician didnt talk about colic i like my pediatrician but i went home with the message that my baby has colic and i just have to live with it
289669 one said my son is like a buddha he just sits there and smiles i wanted to chop her head off
289670 id had this fantasy that during my maternity leave i would be socializing with people and showing off my cooing baby but by the time i got twenty minutes from home sally would be screaming i became so self conscious that i just stopped going out
289671 none of us could perform them for more than a couple of minutes at a time
289672 at night we would just keep doing these maneuvers swinging the car seats moving the babies up and down trading them off between us
289673 ive often thought its amazing that there are not more abused babies who have colic frankly its much harder than taking care of psychiatric patients
289674 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
289675 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
289676 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
289677 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
289678 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
289679 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
289680 dont forget just as 48 has risen theres someone else whos going to rise before chase time
289681 the decision to resort to the use of force was a careless blunder to say the least made over cautionary advice of the u n secretariat here in new york
289682 with cyanide gerber the company he names in his threats says its found no evidence that any food has been tampered with

289687 you always try to be faithful to the origins of the story and you always make sure you honour the tone
289688 usually you want to keep the creator involved as much as possible and thats what we did with the author stephenie meyer
289689 there was something about star wars that has always stayed with me
289690 theres so much they can do with the story thats one of the things that makes it stay interesting
289691 they brought out a line of books that was pretty lame so i stopped buying those
289692 id always loved stars wars and after my wife passed away 15 years ago i threw myself into it and the community became my family i meet some of my best friends at these events i have a day job and a mortgage and car but this is my real life i couldnt say what id do if i didnt have star wars and the community
289693 people will tell you how much star wars means to them fan culture is all sorts of things it can be geeks in costumes who havent showered for two weeks or ordinary looking people who received their love of star wars from their parents and have in turn passed it on to their children
289694 the live action movies were really centred on the skywalker family and weve never gotten to see the full breadth of the conflict
289695 we grew up with star wars we really believe in it
289696 you have to handle fans as a fellow fan and you cant talk down to them fans are smart if they smell bullshit theyre not going to jump into it
289697 ive been called a geek an anorak and even a nutter in australia i dont care none of us cares you take the word people are calling you and you desensitise it if thats what we are then thats what we are and well keep on going
289698 you dont make an artists studio out of any old room so you dont make a battlefield out of any old piece of ground
289699 since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and and theyre going to send out nasty emails
289700 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
289701 he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills

289721 the iraqi government calls upon all parties and groups in kirkuk province to refrain from carrying out any actions that might harm the national unity
289722 the iraqi government is stressing its opposition to any unilateral measure to change the status of kirkuk
289723 the decision will cause problems inside of the city and its illegal
289724 its become seriously more difficult over the last week to reach some kind of political agreement
289725 reflects understandable impatience at the failure of the iraqi government to implement article 140
289726 the iraqi government calls upon all parties and factions to be calm wise and to resort to the constitution
289727 individuals or groups in kirkuk should avoid any sort of unilateral or provocative action and what is needed is passage of a provincial election law
289728 the progress in iraq has allowed us to continue our policy of return on success
289729 this time horizon is a planning tool not a definitive schedule
289730 before it was a status of forces agreement presented as a long term agreement with some hope one day foreign troops will end their mandate
289731 now we are talking about when foreign forces are going to cease their operations
289732 i think we have to wait until those negotiations finish to really know the details
289733 we have been registering for years a loss of police authority and a rapid sinking of a lack of restraint
289734 kick old ladies demand sexual intercourse from women throw water filled balloons against business windows and deliberately cross streets at red lights to create traffic jams
289735 the unity and the authority of the state would be the guiding principle of all government decisions and actions
289736 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land in the shebaa farms kfarshuba hill and ghajar
289737 after the battles there is blood on the ground things will get worse
289738 this struggle calms down for a while then it opens up again
289739 we were able to salvage some of the goods people came in and smashed up the place
289740 id had absolutely no problems before there was none of this sectarianism
289741 if they try to get through the army they will die immediately
289742 we are talking about the existence of a sect if things slip out of control everything would be permitted
289743 what happened here in tripoli is definitely a reaction to what happened in beirut
289744 there is someone igniting this fighting political forces are exploiting this old state of fear
289745 its a battle between states yes there is a syrian saudi struggle
289746 i dream that there will be a settlement in lebanon for that you need a settlement abroad
289747 peculiar to christs sacrifice are the infinite value of victim which give the sacrifice an infinite value of expiation and as merit
289748 i interpret piagets contructivism as more a theory of how people learn where seymours constructionism is more of an approach to learning its a strategy for education i see them as somewhat different its not that one replaces the other constructivism is more about the way people learn and constructionism is more a suggested strategy an educational approach to help people learn
289749 i should add that although i feel im very influenced by and a strong believer of this constructivist approach to learning and seymours constructionist strategies for education its important to be up front about the fact that its not easy to carry out a constructionists approach to learning or to set up an educational approach taking seriously constructivist ideas

289753 its about a month before we normally do our first competition and about 2 or 3 weeks before we normally do our first football game here at warren central
289754 to be able to perform somewhere like this we actually have to work really hard
289755 and i know that everyones going to do their best so im not scared at all because we are here as a group and were going to do it together
289756 of course i would thankfully accept an autograph so peyton if youre watching please
289757 siempre supimos que no habr a problemas y que lionel estar a con su selecci n todo el tiempo estuvimos tranquilos dese bamos que pronto se incorporara al equipo lo dem s se olvida pronto
289758 aunque he tenido pocas oportunidades de ver partidos de santos s que es un equipo de mucho respeto cuando juega en casa pues su estadio corona es muy chico y provoca que uno como rival sienta a la afici n encima sin embargo si hacemos un buen partido la presi n ser para ellos tambi n tengo el conocimiento del gran calor que hace all pero eso es un factor que nos afectar a ambos equipos
289759 no podemos pensar que ser f cil traernos la victoria pues muy independiente de que en su juego anterior contra el am rica no logr quedarse con los tres puntos mostr que tienen un buen ataque que tarde o temprano les dar buenos resultados como en la temporada anterior mientras tanto debemos preocuparnos en ratificar lo que hicimos el domingo pasado para seguir por el mismo camino y sobre todo estar al cien por ciento lo antes posible
289760 con la lesi n de palencia y el problema del pase de bravo tengo muchas posibilidades de que sea titular pero a n no s si iniciar este domingo eso lo decidir el t cnico minutos antes del partido durante estos d as se trabaj con un gran planteamiento pero se pueden hacer algunas modificaciones de ltimo momento
289761 si nos aplicamos a lo que nos pide el profesor reyes creo que podemos sacar el resultado respetamos al puebla pero tenemos que aprovechar la local a y sumar los primeros tres puntos
289762 ser a un error confiarnos hay que recordar que puebla est peleando por cada punto as que vamos a hacer lo nuestro a tener la posesi n del bal n y a poner en pr ctica lo que hemos trabajado ojal que la gente apoye al equipo no los vamos a defraudar
289763 no importa quien anote lo que cuenta es el sacrificio de todos en la cancha si me toca hacer un gol que bueno pero igual lo festejar con quien lo consiga lo importante es lograr el resultado y ojal sea para nosotros
289764 este torneo es uno de los m s importantes del verano llevamos quince d as entrenando y va a ser un torneo que va a decir el nivel en el que estamos
289765 los equipos a los que nos vamos a enfrentar est n m s rodados pero venimos con la intenci n de ganar el torneo dando una buena imagen sobre todo prepararnos para la supercopa donde nos jugamos el primer t tulo para llegar en las mejores condiciones
289766 me gusta jugar con los mejores jugadores y villa es uno de ellos
289767 fue una noche mala porque nos eliminaros pero llegamos con mucha ilusi n de jugar este torneo importante para nosotros porque vamos a jugar contra dos rivales muy importantes
289768 veo muy bien a la plantilla creo que hay un gran grupo futbol stico y humano con l se puede aspirar a conseguir los objetivos
289769 a ellos tampoco les va a asustar ah viene pumas
289770 es el actual campe n y no creo que lo que haya pasado en el juego contra am rica haya sido producto del poco tiempo que le qued en relaci n a los dem s pienso que hicieron inclusive un muy buen partido fue un buen partido el am rica santos pero esto muchas veces no es de justicia es de meter los goles y ya despu s ver qu es lo que hacemos para mejorar
289771 yo creo que es bueno para el espect culo para los dos equipos pensando que en esa parte del pa s el calor es muy intenso en esta etapa del a o y yo creo que una hora m s a la habitual puede mejorar en algo el espect culo y hacer que los dos equipos se puedan brindar y tener un derroche f sico con m s intensidad
289772 guzm n debe estar tranquilo su capacidad no tiene discusi n y no creo que va a ser ni m s o menos porque le den un trofeo l va a seguir siendo lo que es independientemente de si gana o no gana un trofeo dado por equis organismo
289773 no me interesa mucho el tema de verdad la selecci n ahorita es una cosa que yo la dejo a un lado brindo mi apoyo pero no me interesa mucho lo que me interesa es este torneo o este a o completo es mi grupo necesitamos que el equipo vaya adelante que saque resultados que busque los objetivos que logremos ir avanzando en todos los aspectos porque luego muchas veces dedicamos mucho tiempo a otros asuntos que no nos incumbe no quiero distraerme ni perder mi tiempo en temas que no valen la pena en hablar de si convoc a fulano o a sutano no voy a perder mi tiempo en esto
289774 no se va por el empate vamos a buscar ganar
289775 hemos practicado sabemos c mo jug rayados contra puebla quiz ellos tienen que recomponer al igual que nosotros una de las cosas que tratar n de recomponer ser la defensiva esperamos ganar en monterrey

289778 el tjce ha decidido que el acuerdo de asociaci n entre la cee y turqu a debe interpretarse
289779 en el sentido de que se opone a la aplicaci n a un deportista profesional de nacionalidad turca contratado de manera regular por un club establecido en un estado miembro de una norma adoptada por una federaci n deportiva del mismo estado
289780 en virtud de la cual contin a el escrito los clubes s lo pueden alinear en las competiciones de mbito estatal un n mero limitado de jugadores procedentes de estados terceros que no sean parte en el acuerdo sobre el espacio econ mico europeo
289781 el deportivo es favorito pero no lo tememos en absoluto tenemos nuestras bazas y conf o en un resultado favorable all en la ida
289782 estoy contento porque un rival f cil no nos pudo tocar el deportivo es un buen equipo pero nuestra ventaja podr a ser su inicio tard o del campeonato por lo dem s ya no son el equipo que fueron
289783 ellos son para nosotros un rival atractivo y nosotros para ellos no tanto esto tambi n podr a ser un punto positivo para nosotros espero que en la ida logremos un buen resultado para intentar clasificarnos ante un estadio poljud repleto
289784 creo que el deportivo tiene problemas econ micos y que no invierten mucho si se nos da una coyuntura positiva y los jugadores lo dan todo creo que podemos pasar
289785 in a statement issued to the enquirer through her attorney rielle said the fact that i am expecting a child is my personal and private business

289790 there is more to life than simply increasing its speed
289791 we wanted it to be in the ball park of lanois duane lundy the producer has a great thing going on himself so we were not trying to copy lanois just make something that sounds like we have been influenced by his work so we tried to create a tone with the album we wanted to take the listener somewhere else when they listened
289792 the album is kind of sacramental it transports the listener we did this with very little overdubs most of it is live recording duane has a big warehouse that we recorded in in lexington kentucky it was big enough that we could have our own space but all play together this allowed just enough mic bleed in the room with out being too muddy so the vibe was accomplished by choice of mic mic placement and having such a great room
289793 tenebrae involved a band the last album my brother tom and i did all the instrumentation so it was very one dimensional more of a narrow expression after that album we formed a band and we brought them into the studio as a result tenebrae feels a little more open and deeper there is a broader view in the song arrangement and i think it makes a huge difference the instrumentation of the band is what really defines the sound now we have upright bass cello violin acoustic and electric guitar with a trap kit tom plays a fender strat through a blues jr he plays all color and tone he paints over what everyone else puts down the strings too are a huge factor in the music now i call the strings my kryptonite i am now useless without them editors note mike mangione did not make callback when he auditioned for the part of superman we write their parts more in the vein of classical rather than folk they are the melody makers which frees up a lot of space for my vocals
289794 i run it through a avalon u5 i get a warm medium tone which sits nicely under the strings and toms guitar and just above the bass and drums
289795 there is a very small space where my guitar belongs in the music and that set up helps me slide it right in there
289796 it is a great guitar and i spent a lot of time with it on the road but it was just too bright for how i am writing now and the instrumentation we use
289797 my brothers 808 tube screamers i think he uses two of them also his analog delay anyone interested in guitar tone check out my brother on the album and definitely live he has become a wizard of tone in the past few years
289798 my drummer has wood rims that brings more much appreciated warmth the cello and violin both go through a california blond more warmth the cello is electric and through the blond it sounds amazing the bass is electric up right and uses a barbera pick up and that emulates an actual upright better than any other

289834 some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next

289860 who is it that provided such a poor meal or rather such a feast and why are you so proud
289861 and then well all sit around the table drinking little glasses of tea as its customary to do such a man

289878 now youre a wise sage as people say arent you suddenly so smart its always this way
289879 that youre an honest man even though youre a jew a rat a canker
289880 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
289881 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
289882 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine
289883 the gospel portrait implies that jesus would be found guilty by the self conscious religious majority of any age and background

289888 im sure theyll be inside playing some stupid ass elvis music
289889 regardless of how one views the merits of the complaint against comcast the fcc today has shown that its national internet policies work and that they are more than sufficient for handling any net neutrality concerns that may arise
289890 we have argued repeatedly that there is no need for federal legislation in this area and todays fcc action proves that point
289891 without making a judgment on the substance of todays ruling it is clear that the federal communication commission is prepared to uphold its broadband principles
289892 with both the fcc and the federal trade commission ftc engaged in oversight of internet usage and practices new legislation and more regulation with all their unintended consequences are not needed
289893 the once felt urgency for congressional action obviously subsided once fcc chairman kevin martin emerged as a consumers rights advocate
289894 i intend to continue monitoring practices in the industry and pressing for passage of my legislative framework for addressing these issues in the months ahead
289895 the vast majority of network management practices that are being used today will be permissible under the fccs framework
289896 the ones that are problems are ones that are too expansive they target specific protocols and applications even when theres no network congestion but techniques used to identify heavy users and reduce their traffic during peak loads is in principle permissible
289897 were always evaluating our broadband plans and services but have nothing new to announce today regarding our pricing structure
289898 with that said given the usage trends were seeing usage based pricing is one way to deal fairly with internet usage which is very uneven among broadband users
289899 when people make the argument that isps will have to meter traffic its a false choice
289900 going to a tiered model is an economic approach some operators are choosing to go in that direction but there are plenty that can use reasonable network management methods to manage their networks
289901 in my mind the idea of a giant congestion crisis strikes me as fear mongering
289902 it is certainly true that there is great demand for bandwidth and firms will have to build more capacity if they want to meet demand and or begin pricing differently but im not certain it reflects the reality that most internet users are experiencing
289903 im sorry to inform you sir that you have pancreatic cancer
289904 you stupid jerk you broke my heart you are worthless human being how dare you hurt me like that
289905 firewire is for big data and usb is for peripherals
289906 thats not to say they dont exist but firewire 400 is easier to find than firewire 800 except on macs and the number of available ports is typically limited to 1 2 even on a high end motherboard usb 2 0 ports on the other hand are plentiful with most boards offering 8 12 in some combination of included ports and onboard headers

289912 it seemed like they were more interested in going to lunch than hearing from shareholders
289913 at no point did this board or management in any way ever resist microsofts proposal
289914 we proactively engaged with them and tried to reach a positive conclusion for shareholders
289915 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
289916 i thought it would it have been around 40 percent withheld i thought it would be more than last year
289917 i have no problem with yahoo as a company i have a problem with the board
289918 there was never a deal put on the table that was compelling enough that we as the board could look the shareholders in the eyes and say this is a good deal for you
289919 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
289920 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
289921 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
289922 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the
289923 that led to the arrest of a chinese journalist said patrick doherty who presented the proposal for the new york office of the comptroller which holds yahoo stock
289924 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest
289925 he is as some would say a good guy despite the bad things written about him we look forward to him being a productive member of the board
289926 you have to think about whats going to be good for the company in the longer term
289927 we could have less debt and more fun and this material world could get a whole lot brighter

289933 the unemployment rate is giving you a misleading impression of some of the adjustments that are taking place
289934 hours cut is a big deal people still have a job but they are losing income
289935 the change in working hours is the canary in the coal mine
289936 first you see hours get short and eventually more people will get laid off
289937 companies today would rather not go through the process of dumping someone and hiring them back
289938 firms are going to short shifts rather than just laying people off
289939 theres a lot of people at risk in the economy when they keep the headcount high and they only have so many hours to distribute
