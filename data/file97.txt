970035 it was freezing and we had a laugh but it wouldnt have been funny if someone had died
970036 we were waiting for the official boat when we saw this old guy with a rowing boat and decided to take that instead it was more fun
970037 halfway to shore we lost an oar so the boat was drifting to the other side but we didnt really mind
970038 i would like to have wishful thinking and say yes only time will tell our plan is to maintain a friendship and who knows what will happen when we get older
970039 for the next three years were both extremely busy people so its tough
970040 i cant comment when im ready ill issue a statement its because of the children
970041 she thinks the bond she has with him and their kids is stronger than anything sienna can offer despite reports to the contrary the door is still wide open for a reconciliation
970042 when amys working she gets loads of caribbean food delivered to the studio it can get a bit messy sometimes but thats where amy gets her soul from good old fashioned soul food
970043 i can cook chicken soup meatballs a good chicken jerk and fried
970044 the lyrical content is a little off the wall but amy writes about whats on her mind and she goes all out
970045 its only in its early stages but amy is really excited about getting back to what she does best making great music
970046 pamela still looks fantastic but is clearly determined to look as great as possible on the show
970047 producers have been informed she has to appear in only flattering lighting and close ups on her face are apparently a no no
970048 pamela has been around this game long enough to know the pitfalls of a bad camera angle
970049 christina applegate was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening
970050 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery no further statement will be issued at this time
970051 i dare to say that vivienne is proving to resemble angelina in spirit attitude and physicality she is quite elegant like her mother and knox hes a bit of me he likes music like his dad but when he was born he looked like vladimir putin
970052 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time shiloh calls the twins her babies she and zahara pick out their clothes help change and hold them its sweet they are like little mommies
970053 you know what guillermo thinks that i should go to amsterdam and take an acid trip and it would fix my head i think he could be right you know
970054 ive done some things to excess but i hate pot and ive never done acid or ecstasy
970055 being around water and in water makes you feel so good the ocean is really sexy and the wilder and wavier the better
970056 i think its the job of your lover to adorn you my boyfriend gives me jewelry and it always looks great think about it this person adores you this is how he wants to see you
970057 they had to fight to get to me to get to me is like getting to the wizard of oz they had to prove themselves they had to walk down the yellow brick road
970058 but the show isnt about just seeing if i could find someone to work for me its about people chasing their dreams i dont say it in a cocky way but i take pride in being one of the best at doing what i do
970059 youve got your superstars youve got your celebrities and then youve got your people who i call infamous like paris hilton who i know
970060 shes got a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied but she has no talent im sure paris would tell you that herself the timing was right for her a lot of younger women looked up to her
970061 shes a very sweet nice girl but thats it then you put a full stop its over
970062 the number of reality shows is terrible isnt it do you know what its like i said to ozzy people will just have go get over it i havent seen most of them ill watch maybe five minutes of something and check it out
970063 im totally amazed at how shameless people are they will repeat something thats been done over and over again and act as if its unique
970064 i think that the younger generation thinks all they have to do is get on tv and act a bit crazy and things will happen for them
970065 i think the issue for developers is theyre really being hit from all quarters
970066 costs have been going up for some time and many will have bought sites with estimated building costs and will now be facing much higher building costs
970067 yields have moved as well and the straw that broke the camels back now is that companies are not able to get the lending from the banks
970068 i think there will be many other companies in the same position
970069 the best buildings in the best locations will still be able to attract funding but it is slightly different for those in other areas
970070 i would think that debt funding is very difficult without some form of pre let
970071 were back to where we were 17 years ago theres a lack of liquidity from the banks now
970072 at least 17 years ago there was liquidity but there is a banking crisis in terms of funding development work
970073 there is no potential at all for caltongate to fall it has been four years in the making and subject to planning legislation for three years
970074 we have worked hard to make sure it is right for the city
970075 it must have cost a fair bit for them to do this because it wasnt just posted through the door it was actually sent in the post
970076 theyre really well done in the shape of a bin then you lift the lid off to reveal information that weve all known for years that our bins will be collected on a friday as they always are
970077 i phoned the council to let them know and they were a bit surprised this had happened
970078 leaflet distribution for the council is done on a street by street basis we therefore have to deliver to whole streets including those whose collection days will be staying the same as before
970079 i hope the residents of calder road are able to cope with and adjust to this drastic change of service
970080 it is unfortunate if the communications exercise hasnt been as good as it should be but the council does have to communicate these things to the public
970081 we thought a while ago we wanted to raise money for the teenage cancer trust but we wanted to do something different that would inspire people to sponsor us something a bit out of the box
970082 were both into water sports but were not seasoned kayakers by any means yet we thought it would be a good idea to kayak across the irish sea
970083 out in the sea youre only one wee boat and a big wave can knock you over if you capsize its a lot harder to get back in the boat
970084 the fact that were doing it in two boats should work to our advantage as the other person can carry out a rescue if something happens
970085 its still over a week until we sail so the weather forecast will never be too accurate but were expecting to have a headwind of around force two or three heading over which is going to be tough
970086 we wont be able to make it there and back in a single day so we will be staying in ireland overnight but by the time were ready to sail back the headwind will become a tailwind
970087 were hoping to break some speed records on the way back
970088 were absolutely thrilled theyre doing this in support of the trust
970089 angus and gordon used to have great fun together doing water sports up at loch ard
970090 cancer is a tough thing for anyone to go through but teenagers have their own unique problems
970091 gordon was diagnosed when he was 15 and at that age you want to be independent but you suddenly find yourself dependent on a whole host of people
970092 theres very little support because you dont find a great deal of affinity in either adult or childrens wards
970093 its imperative we find a committed ward for teenagers to help them cope with their illness
970094 parents who have two children there in particular will be really really pushed
970095 parents are now faced with having to disrupt their childs nursery provision in order to find more affordable care
970096 i know of one family for which this has already proven to be the case i think we were informed too late they made this decision back in february but didnt tell us until a point where we had no choice
970097 to me it seems like privatising a local council service
970098 i dont think we are doing the private nursery sector out of business but why should that be the first concern
970099 labours big idea is to try to provide affordable care for families the idea that this local authority is putting up fees to be the same as the private sector is outrageous
970100 cowgate under 5s centre is a subsidised service and this increase in the fees will bring it into line with similar facilities in the private sector
970101 lauriston place church is a prominent victorian building which has sadly been allowed to fall into disrepair by the owners
970102 the council has made many efforts to halt its decline and it is essential that any further deterioration is stopped as soon as possible
970103 it is beginning to become an eyesore and this is made worse by the fact it occupies such a high profile location
970104 it is good if we as a council can do something pro active like this to try and move the situation on and find some sort of positive outcome for the building
970105 this building is a fairly significant structure of its time and we are obviously concerned at its neglect in recent years
970106 there has been a quite dramatic fall in heart disease in the last few years the problem is with the future generation
970107 the risk is the reduction in heart attacks we have experienced in recent years will actually go back up again
970108 that will have an impact on individuals levels of ill health on increased health service costs and increased disability
970109 weve definitely seen a drop less people are having heart attacks and those that do are more likely to survive them
970110 but there certainly is this timebomb building up because of obesity and everything else that goes with it such as not getting a lot of exercise not eating fast food
970111 i doubt it incidents of heart disease will get back to the levels it was at when smoking was more common that was such a major factor and it has definitely tailed off the smoking ban has helped a lot
970112 coronary heart disease and stroke remain two of scotlands biggest killers
970113 i welcome the progress that has been made but theres no doubt that we need a long term action plan to further drive down rates of chd and stroke
970114 this government is already taking bold action to cut levels of obesity smoking and alcohol misuse which all contribute to chd and stroke prevalence
970115 as well as taking into account preventative measures like encouraging healthy lifestyles we want to eradicate as far as possible the health inequalities that still exist and ensure that patients receive the best quality of care
970116 and through our health action plan better health better care were committed to providing patients with the best possible treatment and care
970117 this consultation seeks to gather a range of views on how we can further improve services and make them more responsive to patient needs and wishes
970118 we will then draw on these to produce an action plan that will form the core of the revised strategy which well publish before the end of this year
970119 well at least g d doesnt think hes a surgeon
970120 bushes grow and grass grows every year so it shouldnt be a surprise that paths need cut back
970121 its doubly important right now because the use of these paths is growing both with cyclists and pedestrians
970122 its inconvenient if the paths are overgrown but also risks unnecessary conflict between pedestrians and cyclists trying to pass each other
970123 this should be treated in the same way that the council would cut back vegetation overhanging a road or bus lane
970124 cleaned and cut back by the task force as and when they have any spare capacity
970125 a constituent raised concerns with me and said the paths were becoming difficult to use
970126 i assumed that if i reported this the work would be carried out but the response i received was unsatisfactory
970127 the council needs to ensure that cyclists and pedestrians have accessible and clean paths
970128 its never been this bad you have to duck to avoid the hedges and theres a lot of metal poking out from the sides
970129 they only need to tend it once year im not a gardener but i dont think thats too much to ask
970130 we are keen to see common sense and common courtesy prevail and do not understand how lothian buses reaches the conclusion that the dda requires a total ban on prams being taken on the bus
970131 i dont think anyone in a wheelchair wants people thrown off buses for them it should be left up to the drivers discretion
970132 i am worried this is being framed as a wheelchair users versus mothers battle and it is not like that
970133 the public service vehicle accessibility regulations 2000 psvar requires new full size buses to be wheelchair accessible this means that there needs to be a designated wheelchair space
970134 it is acceptable for this space to be used by other passengers when it is not required by a wheelchair user but it should be vacated if at all possible when a wheelchair user requires it
970135 i think the majority of people would agree with ecas on this it just needs a bit of common sense
970136 the number of prams and wheelchair users on the buses compared to how many services there are must be tiny
970137 i dont see why they are making such a fuss
970138 the worry now is that if you have some drivers letting you on the bus on your way into town but you might not get back home
970139 in order to ensure that as far as possible wheelchairs can be accommodated on our vehicles we are unable to carry prams as they cannot be folded
970140 we can however carry one unfolded buggy if the wheelchair space is unoccupied
970141 we are well aware that we have no legal right to enforce non co operation of a drivers request to vacate wheelchair spaces
970142 however our conditions of carriage require other occupants to vacate the space if needed by the wheelchair user
970143 i wasnt there i didnt do it and its not my fault
970144 what i said was that a company has the right to inform the workers of the stark reality of the effect the election may have on their business i wasnt endorsing voter intimidation a company doesnt have any obligation to maintain a particular number of employees or production output if a company feels that the political climate is going to add weight or cost to doing business a company is free to cut staff or production if that is not the case then who is going to force a company to maintain said levels of production and staff or stay in business at all for that matter

970184 for the last year hes said on a number of occasions hed like a fresh challenge
970185 we had a little bit of interest for nicky last week but i didnt feel it was an acceptable market valuation
970186 its an unsatisfactory situation first and foremost id love nicky to be happy to play here and really to feel his future is with us
970187 he wants to go we have an asset so whats the value ive said to players if they dont want to be here as long as we get an acceptable market value they can go
970188 just to make people happy im not going to sell people cheaply we dont have to sell players for financial reasons
970189 its unsatisfactory now because it could well be that hes still here next week and we cant spend a lot of money in the market just in case he is still here
970190 signing a left back has been one of our primary targets all pre season because weve been anticipating this situation
970191 there are certain players wed like but they cost an awful lot of money do we spend the money and then find nicky shoreys still here

970270 describe our lived experiences and the open and honest discussions we have had together
970271 the mission of the church in the world was a really major focus particularly in the first half of the conference
970272 we talked about everything from evangelism to our work with other churches to things like the millennium development goals
970273 a church very much engaged with the suffering and hope of the world
970274 the top priority for some provinces and must be a high priority for all of us
970275 safeguarding creation is a day to day activity not an intellectual exercise
970276 should take a leading role by example modeling a simpler lifestyle using a carbon offset for meeting travel or traveling less
970277 a symbol for ecological commitment to sustaining and renewing gods creation
970278 the violence meted out to women and children within the body of christ is violence done to the body of christ
970279 at this stage of the ecumenical movement we have to recognize that what affects one affects all and that it behoves each church to live in accountability to the rest of the oikumene ecumenical movement
970280 current divisions between anglicans and the action by certain provinces that have provoked them have inevitably disrupted not only the internal life of the communion but also ecumenical dialogues and co operation
970281 sometimes bewildered by apparent anglican inconsistency especially where issues of authority and ecclesiology are concerned
970282 one of the keys to ecumenism is relationships especially among christian leaders
970283 in some situations christians are faced with hostility and even persecution and entering into dialogue with people of other faiths can be difficult and dangerous if not impossible
970284 we recognize that our fractured communion is at times impairing dialogue and sometimes making it impossible
970285 to stop harassing the bishops and the faithful of our church
970286 which is leading a peace movement for protecting the peace constitution for settlement of peace in northeast asia
970287 we applaud the apology made by prime minister kevin rudd to the stolen generations and acknowledge that the journey towards reconciliation has only just begun particularly in relation to remote aboriginal communities in australia
970288 the six million currently hungry in ethiopia with christians in somalia who live daily in fear for their lives
970289 we definitely see spikes around live events but its a total viewer experience
970290 we see mobitv as a continuation of the home viewing experience because its on a mobile device when there is something important going on and youre away from home mobile tv is the natural place to go were very big believers in streaming live video and we believe its critical to building usage habits but its only part of the whole system

970301 we have a fear that israel will do something here to sabotage the trip
970302 the only thing being kept a secret is the location of the boats because of what israel has done in the past they dont want us to go
970303 thats what goes with the territory of non violent resistance it means a willingness to be put in harms way
970304 the fact that ordinary people have to get on two boats is an indictment of the international community
970305 i hope to go to gaza there is no reason why not whether israel will let it happen is another question
970306 these two ships are the beginning of a genuine break the blockade movement if anything happens to these two boats there will be others
970307 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today

970314 there are many more of those mothers who had children with japanese men who came back to the philippines
970315 constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life
970316 we had a good quarter across all our lines of business
970317 bolsters the companys argument that its earnings issue in 2008 has been limited
970318 owens letter states that as the current shareholder issues remain unresolved he feels it is difficult for him to continue working independently as his role demands
970319 the directors have considered the proposal and believe it undervalues the business
970320 in our opinion the indicative proposal of a 4 40 a share is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano
970321 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
970322 the board of imperial confirms that it has received another approach in relation to a possible cash offer for the company
970323 there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made for the company or as to the terms on which any such offer might be made
970324 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry
970325 the continuing strength in the retail businesses in the developing markets
970326 im expecting this to strengthen as it makes landfall either as a strong tropical storm or possibly as a category 1 hurricane
970327 you never want to see a tropical system strengthen right before it makes landfall
970328 i think we can take it to the bank that its going to hit somewhere in southeast texas port oconnor all the way out to sabine pass
970329 it really looks like the center of this wants to be a lot closer to galveston
970330 with tropical storms with category 1 hurricanes the danger isnt when they make landfall
970331 the danger is afterwards with those downed power lines and also the weak trees that are uprooted a lot of those branches get weak and you go outside to pick up your yard and have a branch fall on you thats very dangerous even though its making landfall tuesday morning i want everyone to be careful the entire day just because of those leftover problems
970332 we do expect to have some power outages some flooding on the west end and some wind
970333 were going to have a lot of rip currents and deep holes thats going to be our trouble areas
970334 in my opinion i dont think theres anything to worry about
970335 paine who is the main person doing the testing told us he would have no problem with any of his five children walking down 770 and going to our school and hes the expert
970336 the commission felt everything is ok but they cant guarantee it everybody is saying this is just the best information they have but we want more
970337 lord you are going to have to give me strength
970338 youre going to have this stealth pressure on bank balance sheets until you start to see the ratio of downgrades to upgrades change
970339 the consumers ability to refinance his way out of trouble has diminished greatly
970340 citibank has lost 50 of its book value since last year
970341 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
970342 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
970343 mcdonalds fortune 500 burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
970344 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
970345 the only reason for referring to research is to make a point you were going to make anyway
970346 why should mum and dad have to fight all the time just to try to get the school to teach me properly
970347 ive learned a new word catastrophic and i love that thing you gave me the oup talking dictionary love it
970348 yes weve had a couple like that too but im not saying that here
970349 id heard about this but didnt do anything about it thank goodness you followed it up
970350 we use what the letters tell us but we dont believe the letters tell us everything
970351 her visit to you has had much more than reading benefits it has unlocked her little world and she has joined the rest of us
970352 an ideal speaker listener in a totally homogeneous speech community who knows its language perfectly
970353 language is an epiphenomenon on the world as language users perceive it and that therefore a study of language that seeks to be explanatory will need to take into account the knowledge beliefs expectations and purposes of those language users
970354 there are probably as many similarities between intervention in health care and education as differences
970355 i was so committed to girl scouting it was part of my life and it happened all year for me
970356 girl scouting gave us great memories it was a happy satisfying time and it was a special connection for us

970359 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
970360 badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off
970361 this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
970362 the exact number of climbers affected remains unclear but he was aware of 17 who were involved
970363 i was terrified he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
970364 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
970365 the suspect slaughtered their dog and threw it out of their home and on to the street and proceeded to kill the woman totally severing her head
970366 the attacker walked around the village carrying the head of the victim in one hand and the cleaver in the other
970367 its hard to believe that people like this circulate among us
970368 the attacker must have had some presence of mind because he pretended to surrender and then attacked the police
970369 my thoughts are with the two doctors who were caught up in the middle of this terrible situation
970370 they are both making a good recovery after suffering leg injuries
970371 a lot of feedback that users wanted a way to take street view images on the road
970372 we were expecting the prime minister of canada to do the right thing the right thing was like the chinese head tax
970373 the apology has been given and it wont be repeated
970374 an important evolution in canadas relationship with our first peoples
970375 gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart
970376 we had a good quarter across all our lines of business
970377 bolsters the companys argument that its earnings issue in 2008 has been limited
970378 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
970379 we are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service
970380 today it is a cab driver but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner

970397 are there still areas of the behavioural map marked unknown if so book my passage at once for it is on these mysteriously familiar journeys that i feel most alive in these dark worlds i sense no limits in these forbidden worlds i taste the infinite
970398 charles gatewoods photography transcends fashion expectation and prejudice his genre defies description it is both anthropological documentation and visual documentary both raw imagery and erotic photography
970399 gatewood is the direct photographic descendant of weegee his images are pure photography unfettered by the mock majesty of contemporary elitist art
970400 gatewood shows the kind of post arbus imagery which in hindsight was both logical and essential following diane arbus death

970402 the whole reason we went out and acquired the license and that we now own fallout is that we clearly intended to make more than one
970403 this is not something were going to do once and then go away and never do it again
970404 when that will be or how long that will be god only knows but we acquired it specifically because we wanted to own it and develop it and work on it like we do with the elder scrolls
970405 we once again ask that the press respect his privacy and that of his family

970451 i just want the stuff taken out of which he knows to be untrue
970452 i am definitely looking forward to the challenge i have been here for most of the pre season campaign it is a good squad here at maidstone i am confident that we will have a very good season if the boys continue to work hard
970453 for the first half we looked very strong it would have been hard to differentiate between which was the blue square premier side and which was a ryman league side
970454 i have been shot before when i have said how positive i am about our chances but if we can stay injury free for most of the season and keep our suspensions down then we can compete for one of the top five places
970455 we have been following him for a while and hopefully we will sign him he is what we are looking for he is big strong and powerful and runs in behind teams that is very important at our level
970456 the thing we need is an architecture that combines the full programmability of the cpu with the kinds of parallelism and other special capabilities of graphics processors and that architecture is larrabee

970464 en ocasiones se aduce que del mismo modo que un embri n deviene en lo que ahora somos un espermatozoide y un vulo pueden engendrar un embri n y as la interrupci n del proceso evolutivo del embri n es an loga a la destrucci n de espermatozoides y vulos por ejemplo mediante el uso del preservativo

970469 see i already know x amount of people who loyally read and would buy my book in hardcover even
970470 the governments approach to the closure of post offices with its narrow emphasis on economic costs without regard to social benefits is an erosion of community resilience the determination to push ahead with the closure of small gp practices and their replacement by polyclinics is another move in the direction of narrow cost efficiency over enriching personal intimacy more broadly the web of autonomous institutions which help bind communities together have found their lives made more difficult in the last ten years from scouting to child minding regulation has driven adults out of roles where they served their communities school governance and charitable engagement have become much more time consuming legally fraught and bureaucratically complex
970471 frustrated by government bureaucracies which treat them as just a number dismayed by automated helplines and unresponsive websites which deprive them of human contact and a sympathetic ear they come to the surgery in search of someone who will listen who will value them as humans not cases and yet even as i like almost all mps witness this growing demand for a more personal responsive human face to government this government is making public services more distant
970472 the principle at the heart of our schools reform programme is changing the way we make schools accountable so that community relationships are strengthened we will make schools accountable to parents by allowing parents to choose the school they want for their child well give every parent the right to take the money currently allocated to their childs education and then deploy it in accordance with their priorities not the governments well make it easier for new providers to enter the state system reforming planning and other laws to increase choice and diversity parents will be empowered to choose the school with the pedagogy the disciplinary approach the ethos and the philosophy they believe in whether its the philosophy of rudolph steiner or thomas arnold it will be parents who decide whats right for their children
970473 my colleague greg clark has previously outlined how important it is for us to see society as a caravan moving through the desert as we all make progress its important that none are left too far behind the relationship between those at societys head and those less fortunately placed is important to us all and there is a duty to ensure that the relationship between those at the top and bottom of society does not become too distant we must not become strangers to each other in the same country
970474 now im a huge fan of open market economies growth dynamism entrepeneurship and success i would never want to impede economic growth indeed im anxious to remove many of the barriers which currently stand in the way of dynamism and ambition but i do believe that we need to ensure that with a culture which encourages facilitates and celebrates success theres also a parallel culture of responsibility reciprocity and respect of those to whom much is given much is expected thats why we as a party have devoted so much time to exploring how we can encourage philanthropy in every area from investment in education to culture and environmental enhancement thats why david cameron has emphasised the vital importance of corporate social responsibility thats why our social policy is so explicitly redistributive
970475 citizens want a more personal form of interaction with government
970476 la copertura pi ampia e massiccia di unolimpiade che la rai ricordi
970477 i think were prepared for the worst if i can say that
970478 you know what im saying we dont know what to expect
970479 we went through coach petrinos spring and it was very difficult obviously so you go ahead and throw another 30 degrees on top of that temperature and go out there
970480 weve worked out theres been enough talking going on its time to practice fans got a glimpse of petrinos offensive system in the spring now the honing begins for the razorbacks brutal 12 game slate which opens aug 30 against western illinois
970481 everybody has kind of seen the gist of it that we did in the spring game and what we had in the spring
970482 weve just got to continue to grow on that and let everybody be on the same page and keep going from where we were arkansas players werent immune from the eager discussions about the opening of the petrino era
970483 a lot of people are looking forward to this season
970484 the average person spends 2 weeks of their life waiting at stoplights
970485 he would not allow her to leave for several hours arkansas coach bobby petrino dismissed fairchild from the razorbacks football team in june he had been suspended from the team since his arrest
970486 if i had one of those in the backyard i wouldnt be game to hang out the washing
970487 i was hoping to give myself birdie opportunities i wanted to stick to my game plan not think about the scores
970488 im not usually in that position and i try to chase a person i wanted to play it like i was behind and try to attack the course i was trying to put more pressure on julie
970489 i wanted to get that first birdie out of the way to show that i was here to stay
970490 i made a good solid putt and figured it was going to be a good day
970491 im just not the caliber of golfer she is shes used to playing under par golf
970492 pars are good to me i guess competing with her im going to have to have a different mentality about birdies are what you need but im not disappointed i hoped she wouldnt be on her game today and it would be a match
970493 you know you are going to get 100 percent from malcolm on every down
970494 hes got a motor that doesnt stop and that really sets a tone for the rest of our linemen and the defense as a whole
970495 in the spring arkansas missed the push that senior ernest mitchell 6 2 305 of newnan ga could provide at nose guard because of his knee injury and the depth that senior marcus shavers 6 3 280 of lucas texas could give because of shoulder rehab
970496 i think he sees the light that hes got an opportunity as a senior to step up and play
970497 gray opened spring drills second team to jones but moved ahead once the hogs got into pads at the third practice
970498 at the point of attack he read his blocks well he held his gap and in the run game he was a good anchor point for us hes putting himself in position to go and make plays
970499 cord still has a ways to go especially in the pass rush part
970500 though arkansas is stout up front petrino said the there is room for a freshman lavunce askew 6 2 288 from camden brian christopher 6 2 245 alfred davis 6 2 305 of college park ga and zac stradther 6 1 285 of north little rock to work themselves into the rotation
970501 you look at our receiver corps no doubt well have a lot of competition
970502 joe adams and darius wright are two who can play outside and really have good quickness and change of direction and are playmakers
970503 its not as hard as it used to be because they have been here all summer
970504 coach brooks is always out there on the field running around and showing a lot of energy
970505 sometimes when he gets fired up in practice hell put his hands on guys to show them thats not the way you block and hell fire out on somebody thats 200 pounds heavier than he is just to show that he can still do it
970506 no way is coach brooks getting old in our opinion brooks also demonstrated his physical fitness during a vacation trip to oregon in late june a boat he was in with his son and a friend turned over in a river but all three men swam safely to a sand bar
970507 you cant sink coach brooks hes going to stay a afloat
970508 nobody else could have done the job hes done here
970509 i dont have a timetable for retiring im not sure
970510 im completely healthy im fine but if im not a year from now i want to have something in place and its in place
970511 im very encouraged by that brooks said hes also confident the wildcats will continue to build on their recent success rather than fall back
970512 i think we became a viable team in the sec east
970513 i believe well be a viable team again this year the wildcats return eight starters on defense led by jarmon and cornerback trevard lindley
970514 we should be the best defensive team that ive had at kentucky
970515 the offense has carried us a lot the last two years
970516 now its our turn on defense to step up and carry more of the load and weve got a lot of guys back to make sure thats going to happen
970517 its not flat dead even like i said previously hes got some ground to make up with his teammates and coaches phillips has said while hes excited about his chance to be kentuckys coach hes in no rush to replace brooks
970518 i would love for rich to be here as long as he wants
970519 we price in us dollars and i dont have to tell you about whats happened in the last few years
970520 the cost of doing business outside the us has dramatically changed its reasonably likely well have some sort of price hike the pressure has built in the last few years
970521 said schulte who through two rounds led oxendine by four strokes
970522 im not usually in that position and i try to chase a person
970523 i wanted to get that first birdie out of the way to show that i was here to stay
970524 i made a good solid putt and figured it was going to be a good day
970525 im just not the caliber of golfer she is shes used to playing under par golf
970526 and it was very difficult obviously so you go ahead and throw another 30 degrees on top of that temperature and then stay out there
970527 like a little kid about to ride a roller coaster
970528 youve got to block it out and go with it
970529 i think its something weve all been wanting for a little while gives us a chance to make plays and see what happens
970530 a lot of the routes and concepts are different but i am definitely getting used to that
970531 i graduated from greenwood high on saturday night and moved in on a sunday
970532 so may 18 or may 19 was the day i came up
970533 no splint and a shave during sundays dinner it was observed there was no splint or bandage on the hand that junior linebacker wendel davis injured during an altercation earlier this summer
970534 yeah theres no way you knowwho would have said that
970535 today i woke up at the sound of gunfire fireworks and car horns was it yet another stupid wedding at 8 am no maybe it was it world war 3 maybe it was some drunks drug addicts in happy hour
970536 i have decided that i do not want to do a shot at love season 3 because i feel like this show doesnt fully represent who i am as a regular person
970537 it was fun while it lasted but as life moves on i feel that it is important that i move on as well
970538 i think that defensive line should plan on being dominant they should plan on playing better than they played last season
970539 that offensive line should be and look to be the more physical line in our conference maybe in our country
970540 if theyre seeing it as im going to go play like i played last year thats not good enough
970541 i wish life were like spooks the tv series where everything is a knowable and b solvable by six people
970542 ive been saying as you know for several years that this terrorist threat is very real its been building up over a long period of time
970543 its not just in this country as weve seen recently from incidents in india france other parts of the world this is a threat that has grown up over a generation
970544 over 1 000 arrests have been made under anti terrorism since 9 11 and out of those 27 have been found guilty out of those 27 only nine have been muslims
970545 today my officers and the police are working to contend with some 200 groupings or networks totalling over 1 600 identified individuals and there will be many we dont know who are actively engaged in plotting or facilitating terrorist acts here and overseas
970546 today we see the use of home made improvised explosive devices
970547 tomorrows threat may i suggest will include the use of chemicals bacteriological agents radioactive materials and even nuclear technology

970551 samir a is kennelijk al jaren geobsedeerd om zijn leven te geven voor de in zin ogen goede zaak wij twijfelen niet aan zijn intenties
970552 zij vormden een bedreiging voor de democratische rechtsstaat aldus de officieren
970553 hun ideologie was zo radicaal en de voorbereiding zo ver dat aanslagen een kwestie van tijd waren

970556 ik ken de as soennah moskee als mijn broekzak ik weet wie fawaz om zich heen heeft

970561 we can eclipse cuba as the leading boxing nation but first we have to do the business in beijing
970562 our disconnection from business or technology limitations makes us focus 1st on what the audience wants 2nd on how they will use it then we manage back the technical and business issues from there
970563 het moest erop lijken en dat is ook wel gelukt
970564 ik wilde daarmee de frustraties van me af filmen ik wilde weten hoe ik er zelf op zou staan
970565 ik dacht wat zij kunnen kan ik ook sommige woorden heb ik exact gekopieerd van de jongens die de aanslagen in londen hebben gepleegd
970566 ik verwerp het systeem maar niet met daden pas als minister verdonk mijn paspoort afpakt kan ik iets doen
970567 ik moest hem zo vaak tegenhouden daarvoor had ik eigenlijk een lintje van koningin beatrix moeten krijgen
970568 maar we denken ook aan mensen in de kennissenkring van de dader die moeten wat hebben gemerkt
970569 wij hebben goede hoop dat de dader alsnog wordt gepakt

970574 tijdens de verhoren gebruikte de mivd hard geluid ze gooide met water en gebruikte afgeplakte skibrillen volgens de commissie werden de gevangenen hiermee niet onder druk gezet maar ging de behandeling wel te ver
970575 de nederlandse militaire missie in irak was slecht voorbereid zowel ambtelijk militair als organisatorisch de status van de nederlandse troepen die geen deel uitmaakten van de bezettende militaire macht was onhelder ter plaatse zijn fouten gemaakt militaire ondervragers bleken niet competent er waren communicatiestoornissen en competentiekwesties waardoor op een cruciaal moment een eenhoofdige leiding en dus toezicht ontbrak gedetineerden zijn niet behandeld zoals dat met krijgsgevangenen behoort te gebeuren
970576 de nctb zorgt voor de ontwikkeling van een helder en eenduidig beleid op het vlak van terrorismebestrijding dit geldt zowel voor strategische en internationale beleidsontwikkeling als voor de communicatiestrategie
970577 usama bin laden is wanted in connection with the august 7 1998 bombings of the united states embassies in dar es salaam tanzania and nairobi kenya these attacks killed over 200 people in addition bin laden is a suspect in other terrorist attacks throughout the world
970578 reason should we acknowledge that organized religion has sometimes sparked precisely the kinds of emancipation movements that could lift islam into modern times
970579 het salafisme hier en in saoedi arabi moet met wortel en tak worden uitgeroeid dat is ook wat onze soldaten doen in afghanistan de strijd voor vrijheid en veiligheid in afghanistan is van wezenlijk belang voor onze veiligheid

970581 70 ontstond een nieuw filmgenre genaamd blaxploitation afro amerikanen waren het zat dat hollywood voor blanken was en dat de zwarte acteurs geen serieuze rollen kregen ze waren altijd het hulpje de slechterik of de uncle tom

970583 er is iets misgegaan we cre ren nog een instantie zodat het wel goed gaat

970587 wij noemden het binnen het bedrijf het materiaal van de moslimextremist
970588 ik was bang voor hun vuurwapens en hun gevaarlijke ideologie
970589 ik heb geen contact met mijn familie ik kan mijn vrienden niet bellen
970590 meneer koppe u zei dat ik een leugenaar was toen ik vertelde dat er nog twee vuurwapens waren
970591 die wapens zijn later gevonden in de kelder van mohammed c
970592 als dit klopt dan is het de eerste keer in groot brittanni
970593 er zijn honderden bankovervallen gepleegd door mannen met vrouwenkousen over hun hoofd maar niemand praat over het verbieden van kousen
970594 het meeste van dit materiaal is nog niet bij ze aangekomen zo wordt het moeilijk de zaak inhoudelijk te kunnen behandelen we kunnen ons nu niet goed voorbereiden
970595 ook wij vinden het heel vervelend dat dit nog niet is gebeurd
970596 ook valt steeds meer op dat be nvloedbare tieners in de omgeving van jihadistische netwerken verkeren onder wie steeds meer nederlandse jongeren van turkse afkomst waren in het verleden incidenteel personen die opdoken in deze lokale jihadistische netwerken nu lijken kleine groepen jongeren als geheel te jihadiseren
970597 opmerkelijk is verder de jihadisering van een steeds groter wordende groep radicale nederlandse jongeren van turkse afkomst waar in het verleden incidenteel personen met een turkse achtergrond opdoken in lokale jihadistische netwerken met vooral een noord afrikaans karakter duiken nu kleine groepen jongeren op die als geheel lijken te jihadiseren onder deze jongeren is in toenemende mate sprake van vereenzelviging met de islamitische gemeenschap welke de plaats in is gaan nemen van de turksnationale identiteit frustratie over de positie van moslims in nederland en woede over de gebeurtenissen in conflictgebieden geven voeding aan het gevoel iets te moeten ondernemen
970598 de ontwikkeling van een radicaal islamitisch gedachtegoed in een relatief beperkt deel van de turkse gemeenschap in nederland zet zich voort onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat er een multi etnisch netwerk van radicaal islamitische personen bestaat waarvan turkse jongeren deel uitmaken ook in sommige turkse moskee n wordt een radicaalislamitische boodschap verspreid zij het niet in de vrij toegankelijke preken maar in besloten sessies op internet zijn op turkse websites berichten waargenomen die duiden op radicaal islamitische geloofsopvattingen in sommige gevallen richt de aandacht zich daarbij op politici en opiniemakers als mevrouw hirsi ali of de heer wilders die vanwege hun stellingname in het debat over de islam in nederland mikpunt zijn van scheldpartijen en verwensingen hoewel het tot op heden gaat om een relatief gering aantal turkse jongeren dat zich tot de radicale islam voelt aangetrokken constateert de aivd dat er sprake is van een stijgende lijn
970599 op internet zijn op turkse websites berichten waargenomen die duiden op radicaal islamitische geloofsopvattingen in sommige gevallen richt de aandacht zich daarbij op politici en opiniemakers als mevrouw hirsi ali of de heer wilders die vanwege hun stellingname in het debat over de islam in nederland mikpunt zijn van scheldpartijen en verwensingen
970600 de terroristische dreiging voor nederland blijft substantieel hoewel een combinatie van sommige elementen in het dreigingsbeeld neigen naar een afname van de dreiging
970601 de afgelopen periode ging er van de bekende terroristische netwerken geen concrete dreiging uit en is er geen opvallende interesse voor nederland vanuit internationale jihadistische netwerken geconstateerd
970602 redenen om het dreigingsniveau te handhaven zijn de verzwarende factoren als de aanzienlijke dreiging tegen andere europese landen transatlantische bondgenootschappen en het westen in het algemeen
970603 nederland blijft als onderdeel van het westen een potentieel doelwit van terroristen tevens blijken kleine kringen van radicale moslims bijzonder licht ontvlambaar die lichte ontvlambaarheid kan leiden tot spontane uitbarstingen van individuen en groepjes

970613 you may have the added task of getting a fresh hearing for reasoning that considers ends more than means that discerns more than it calculates that more often questions
970614 a post intellectual society is one where public relations substitutes for public policy where one mass media image can wipe out many careful arguments where sound moral character means feeling good about yourself and the increase of freedom means more consumer choices it is finally a society where intellectuals are very comfortably kept thinking about what they are told to think about i suppose the biggest difference in the past 30 years is that the intellectually gifted now have so many more places to sell out

970623 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
970624 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
970625 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
970626 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
970627 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
970628 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
970629 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
970630 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well

970644 florida is going to face a very different racial and cultural gap as the older boomers age and the younger immigrants come with competing demands on public services

970692 my own mother used to call me and id tell her about the kids rarely would i put them on the phone because it was so expensive
970693 that one sunday call was all my mom got when i think about ichat today she could have seen them daily
970694 more likely to spend the money on diapers than gas
970695 for older people its the real answer what more can a grandparent ask for other than to live across the street
970696 im using e mail just as i might have used snail mail 10 years ago
970697 and im using skype just as i might use the phone
970698 they could see the environment of it something beyond just a postcard
970699 with quick little videos instead of static images of where i was they got to really be there with me
970700 if they dont put anything up there for a while you wonder whats going on and how come
970701 we are in touch all the time like i am with my internet friends
970702 to her thats great she feels connected to what im doing and now she has a circle of bloggers that she reads and who read her my mom loves that community thats formed around her blog

970714 families work very hard over the course of a lifetime to accumulate assets with a hope that they can pass them on to the next generation
970715 i knew we had to do something to protect what we do have
970716 i have to grapple every day with the fact that i had to do all of this finagling and essentially make the country pay for my husbands care
970717 i didnt have a choice having an ill husband wasnt what i signed up for
970718 new york has by far the most elaborate medicaid program of anyone in the country because they have been willing to spend more money
970719 if you can establish a pattern of gift making and you were in good health when you made the gift for example you could argue that gift should not be considered a sanctionable transfer
970720 according to the law there was nothing that could be done
970721 we dont always have the luxury to pick right now we have more medicaid residents than we budgeted for
970722 whether its 100 percent accurate or not is always debatable
970723 these senior citizens have worked 50 60 years paying taxes to this government and now this government is not going to take care of them
970724 you go over to china or japan and they worship their senior citizens but not this country
970725 it seems to me that the country cant afford to have more and more entitlements
970726 whenever you set up a program like this you create a situation where people on the fringes take advantage of it
970727 i can see why they tried to close the door
970728 people have opinions they have perspective one of the things that create expertise is your perspective
970729 theres a distinction between total subjectivity and context that you can provide because you have experience and you speak with authority because of that experience i think journalists shy away from speaking with authority and that they ought to speak with it
970730 its like obscenity you know it when you see it and you rarely do

970801 it costs 88 cents more per payment to make a check payment versus an electronic payment

970803 we already have over 52 000 people who have signed up for the card
970804 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
970805 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
970806 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
970807 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
970808 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come

970833 where i fall to the ground like im fainting and i cant move or talk and then afterwards im very weak
970834 the thesis of the book is that when we think about democracy we should really think about not simply the electoral process but the inner stuffing of democracy which is the institutions that produce liberty separation of powers the rule of law courts and constitutions and that that inner stuffing is in many ways more important than elections anyone can hold an election its very difficult to produce institutions that preserve liberty
970835 well if we look at russia after the fall of communism its a very interesting and somewhat tragic tale there was an enormous emphasis put on elections on political freedom and what happens is boris yeltsin and putin after him winning free and fair elections begin to severely undermine the independence of the courts severely undermine the local autonomy of government they fire regional governors they dont like appoint super governors sacked people of the upper house of parliament of the duma and intimidate a once free russian media into being entirely coward and almost totally silent and subservient to the state so what youve seen in russia is the flourishing of democracy but the withering of liberty and that process that dynamic is true in venezuela its true in iran its true in russia its true in most of central asia forty two of forty eight african countries have held elections but i dont think any of us would really call what has happened there democracy
970836 what i found looking at it historically was that in order to get genuine liberal democracy you needed to have created this background of constitutionalism separation of powers and such and that the surest path to it was the introduction of capitalism because capitalism requires the rule of law it requires contracts in commercial law capitalism is also the surest path to economic growth so it produces a middle class now historically it is the middle class that has always been at the forefront of the demand for democracy karl marx understood this marx always argued that democracy was the product of the bourgeoisie it was something that the bourgeoisie wanted and he was right i mean he didnt like that much but in fact in most societies where youve had lasting genuine democracy you have needed as a kind of bulwark and base a middle class that demands the rule of law that demands a political voice when you dont have that democracy can flourish of course there are exceptions but by and large it will be weak
970837 what i say is that theres a range of about three thousand to six thousand dollars per capita gdp at which point which is the zone of transition in which democracies make it that is to say if youre below that line if your per capita gdp is under three thousand dollars per capita gdp historically countries that have gone democratic have failed and when you get to the higher range of that if youre over six thousand dollars per capita gdp there is not a single example of a failed transition to democracy and i use these numbers simply as a simple rule of thumb what the numbers tell you is that the society has been able to modernize itself you see its easy to go from being a very very poor country to you know i dont know a thousand dollars per capita gdp the government just has to stop doing stupid things but to really get to that middle income level five six thousand dollars per capita gdp the whole society has to modernize you have to develop a sense of the rule of law you have to develop other institutions you have to develop a modern civic culture and so the numbers four or five thousand dollars per capita gdp are a proxy for that process of modernization and my fundamental point i suppose is that you cant get democracy you cant get a modern democratic form of government if you dont have a modern democratic society the two are in an organic relationship with one another
970838 no ill admit to it i mean look theyve done some terrible things particularly in tienanmen but for the most part this has been a regime that is trying to modernize its country and is succeeding for the most part the average chinese today has more economic freedom more freedom of travel more freedom of religion than theyve ever had and this is something its important to understand these are not trivial freedoms john locke when thinking about freedom the definition of freedom put economic liberty at the heart of liberty in general james madison adam smith all these people understood that the right of private property the right of ownership the rights that we today call capitalism are a very significant part of what liberty means so the chinese government has been moving on that dimension they have not been moving on the political dimension and i regret that i think they should be doing more on that front but eventually they will face a dilemma ten fifteen years down the road i believe the chinese government will find they have had forty years of economic growth they have produced a middle class and that that middle class wants a greater say in the management of its government and they will have produced a rule of law which requires that kind of thing now they may not choose to do that but then china will face a real crisis
970839 when i began thinking about the subject i realized you look around the world in the 1990s there were lots of countries holding elections

971080 its been fascinating to get involved with the fiesta love factory love report and find out how the nation really loves to love i certainly wouldnt have banked on men topping the tables in believing in both soulmates and love at first sight by all accounts men looking for love should move to london and start making more trips across the channel
971081 in celebration of our fiesta love factory and having produced the new ford fiesta with real passion we wanted to delve into europes romantic sensibilities and really find out what else makes people tick our suspicions have certainly be confirmed that our nation is one that loves to love so we certainly hope people fall for the new fiesta too

971094 its great because it works across all time zones so everybody can see the proposed times within their own schedule and respond accordingly it now takes at most 24 hours to schedule a meeting that used to take six or seven days it was a nightmare these projects would really not be possible without timebridge because we would not be able to get together to plan and strategize
971095 we all have tiny windows of time before between and after classes so our availability is really limited using timebridge to schedule our meetings allows all of us to make the most of our time
971096 ive been able to meet with students who i could never get to come see me before
971097 students would much rather communicate via email or some other digital means than receiving a phone call to schedule a meeting
971098 so now when i receive an email from a student asking to meet with me i simply respond with a timebridge invite offering a few times for them to pick from it gets the meeting scheduled much more quickly and everyone is more comfortable with the process it has allowed me to strengthen and build new relationships with students

971120 jews and israelis in muslim majority countries are like canaries in coal mines as are women in muslim majority countries you can tell a lot about a place by observing how each are treated the taliban impose an oppressive dress code on women at gunpoint for instance and the hamas charter is explicitly genocidal its possible to take the radical islamist temperature of a muslim society simply by measuring the misogyny and anti semitism at both the government level and among the general population the only country in the entire middle east that isnt anti semitic at the government level the popular level or both is the state of israel

971170 she thinks the bond she has with him and their kids is stronger than anything sienna can offer despite reports to the contrary the door is still wide open for a reconciliation
971171 the breakdown of a marriage is a very difficult and painful experience especially when children are involved in light of the fact that many pictures have surfaced in print and on the internet which has caused myself and my family great embarrassment i felt it necessary to at least acknowledge publicly that yes indeed my wife and i have separated and i will not be commenting any further

971216 there has been high level engagement between the chinese and indian governments to facilitate co operation between the two countries when investing acquiring overseas oil assets as far as we understand this never resulted in a formal agreement but rather an informal memorandum of understanding of sorts both companies have a declared appetite for oil assets especially those that offer good production growth in many ways imperials portfolio is tailor made for either or both so it is not inconceivable that ongc majority government owned and sinopec an arm of the government team up to avoid competing against each other we note that neither company has ever consummated a foreign corporate takeover of a listed entity

971278 s lo una semana antes de la suspensi n de pagos pas por la promotora para saber si escriturar amos antes o despu s del verano y me aseguraron que en tres semanas la vivienda ser a m a
971279 lo m s gracioso es que hay casas terminadas como la m a pero sin la c dula de habitabilidad que tiene que gestionar martinsa fadesa por tanto no tienen suministro de luz ni de agua ni de gas
971280 yo quiero la casa pero si no al menos que me devuelvan mi dinero
971281 el ayuntamiento de la pobla nos ha dicho que nos facilitar las c dulas de habitabilidad pero habr que esperar a ver si es cierto
971282 el primer paso es revisar el contrato y comprobar si la promotora incluy los datos de alg n avalista en cuyo caso se podr reclamar el dinero a este ltimo y que fadesa se arregle con ellos
971283 es importante que no se deje de pagar para no incurrir en incumplimiento de contrato y poner el piso y el dinero en bandeja a martinsa fadesa
971284 the fact that no republican has ever won the presidency without winning ohio more than any other speaks to the importance and the uncertainty of winning that state
971285 brand development policies and procedures and updating c i hosts current service portfolio
971286 hosting has always held a special place in my interests and ive continued to read whitepapers on emerging technologies and blogs and forums
971287 virtualization piqued my interest a couple of years ago it was easy to recognize the significance and an offering has been in development for some time now were excited to unveil it in the near future
971288 the biggest challenge for a hosting company is remaining relevant and being heard above the noise
971289 differentiation and reaching a customer with a solid developed service offering is key
971290 this is just the first of many new offerings were hoping to launch this year as we renew our focus on service and technology
971291 the service gap was the main reason chris faulkner and i got into the hosting business
971292 we drew from our previous business experiences and agreed that we could do it better my plan is to return our services to that model recognizing the needs of our customers getting them involved in voicing their needs and priorities training our staff and delivering superior offerings
971293 i cant think of a better person to collaborate in this next phase of our business than a founder particularly as we develop goals and strategies for the next ten years
971294 web hosting has changed over the years weve been doing business
971295 weve got 11 years of experience to back us up as we move forward to this next phase as trailblazers weve had to learn from our mistakes but were excited about our future and we look forward to offering our customers improved products and services in the months and years to come
971296 i was in gap a few weeks ago and there was some sort of generic indie music playing i was with a friend whos a promoter and a bit younger than me after about three or four tracks i asked him whose lp is this and he said no its a compilation every track sounded identical the guitars the production all these bands sound like theyre made in the same studio with the same producer its such a ball less soulless generic whitewashed indie sound you could probably take a member from each band and throw them together in a new group and no one would be able to tell the difference theyre completely interchangeable scouting for girls are like the sound of satans scrotum emptying theyre abysmal
971297 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
971298 you dont want to mess up the other three teams but were still working on it and i think well get it done in the next couple of weeks
971299 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
971300 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
971301 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul collingwood and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
971302 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday
971303 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
971304 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
971305 it doesnt matter where the 2020 olympic games are held
971306 but many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the games
971307 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
971308 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations
971309 so that our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
971310 with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
971311 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport

971316 great eh seen a better description of the leftard malaise i mean lately a classic
971317 nathanael west was well practiced in the arts of revelation and cruelty that go way beyond what we normally think of as satire
971318 now heres the thing i have a rather good sense of darkness being a researched empirical and humorous kinda guy and thus i tend not to turn away from er unpleasantness just because they may be a drag or lack a laugh track like the truth of hamas air aka emirates tariq ali al gore sean penn and macram etc a problem for sadly many that i meet is that they can believe utterly in useless and poisonous clich s that make them seemingly incapable of appreciating what we have how essential it is and how very fragile that its not permanent and can be taken away and it is being taken away but mostly by increments the remorseless unnoticed ratchets and one way slide rules of the pc left and our gradual islamisation for example never mind an economically resurgent totalitarian communism via china rebranded by putin in russia and in the madhouse of north korea chavez and hamas the rotten sources of support from the saudi dump iran pakistan africa indonesia north thailand and many many more never mind the global socialism of global warming and the hideous blocking in of the rotten un by 57 islamist shit piles african cannibal kingdoms and other dangerous and insidious garbage so many folks i meet lack any realistic understanding perspective or learning regards the mechanisms and evil swirling about them and yet the same folks have no real interest in learning the subjects on which have they have merely second hand opinions on and thus strongly held still its a larf init
971319 nathanael west had a brief barely noticed career before his sudden death in 1940
971320 seemed to enjoy their suffering the sort that was self inflicted
971321 youll probably never see this jonathan but a comprehensible plot has always been important to people who do a lot of reading
971322 wow much like paul bowles this author takes no prisoners may i suggest that you be in a stable frame of mind before reading this novel lest it prove to be one unsettling factor too many for you i found myself to be none too comfortable to be counted as a member of the human race at the end of this book written at about the same time as raymond chandlers early novels and set in the same real estate the day of the locust is about five times as sordid it is totally original and totally unpredictable except for the scent of doom that pervades it from the opening page you know that the author was writing about what he saw los angeles and hollywood were rotten seventy years ago what must they be like now west covers so much ground with such economy and its all so readable this devastating work is a remarkable achievement what a staggering loss that nathanael west died so young and what a surprise to find homer simpson hiding out in such a fine novel highly recommended
971323 so dig were not these reviews groovy and perceptive with some great lines bravo and kudos to em all says i these are two very cool books being dark satire one of my favourite styles its not just an english thing
971324 the moment i know what your blog address is yes i am that lame
971325 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
971326 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
971327 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
971328 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
971329 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
971330 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
971331 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
971332 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team
971333 that pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult
971334 i always had faith in my team we knew we could come back as we have done it in the past there is no doubt there is enough quality in the team
971335 the 90 run start given by openers virender sehwag and gautam gambhir in the second innings was crucial then sharma and zaheer bowled brilliantly today
971336 i think 307 was a good total to chase but the loss of early wickets put us under pressure sharma has shown that questions can be asked from batsmen if you bowl in right areas
971337 they india played really good cricket as they knew it was a crucial game for them our bowlers kept us in the game but batting let us down we now need to come back strongly in the final test

971347 there is a general malaise about economies slowing down around the world
971348 as in china airlines and refiners in hong kong lost ground as oil rose cathay pacific dropped 1 9 percent to hk 14 68 and china southern tumbled 4 8 percent to hk 3 38
971349 the market still looks firm although it is down from highs
971350 iran and edouard are the main points to keep an eye on
971351 their remit is to tackle inflation and not really to look after the economy as such as a first port of call it seems that the remit is shifting somewhat and there is external pressure being placed on them in order to keep the economy afloat
971352 while the ecb thus far have been entirely inflation focused we do not believe they will be immune to the weakening of growth
971353 this is especially true as our analysis suggests the inflation peak may well have been achieved barring of course any dramatic upside reversal to oil food prices

971369 that shows the wcha you look at how many games a team like us has played against teams that are in the rankings were going be playing close to 30 games by the time the seasons over
971370 other teams are going to be playing eight or 10 a strong schedule helps you and thats the way it should be
971371 were kind of lurking around right now weve got four games to try and continue to get points and climb up the standings
971372 that first round theres no question there will be some elimination the team that wins will have a chance to go to the ncaas and the team that loses probably will be out
971373 its a lot more exciting thats the loudest ive heard this building all season there in the second period saturday

971431 in 1988 the fifa congress made the decision that the olympic tournament should be open to players under 23
971432 since then we have not had a single complaint or problem with the release of players

971492 o kl ber n o vive um momento bom como ele mesmo diz o forte dele sempre foi o passe e n o est conseguindo encaixar isso um momento ruim e vamos ter uma conversa com ele at quarta feira mas n o s ele o culpado
971493 mesmo que seja uma al quota de 0 0001 para a receita importante mas como instrumento de controle
971494 feliciano um personagem que representa o que mais detesto politicamente
971495 detesto todo esse conservadorismo mercantiliza o e falta de ideais o que quero representar aqui um pouco do que acontece agora com o m xico h classes pol ticas que para conseguir se manter no poder s o capazes de fazer qualquer coisa e isso algo que acontece em toda a am rica latina
971496 ele considerado o melhor prosador em l ngua espanhola de sua poca tinha um espanhol impec vel era um intelectual e foi secret rio particular de pancho villa portanto um participante muito ativo da pr pria revolu o
971497 com esquadr o guilhotina quis fazer uma reflex o sobre a hist ria a partir da perspectiva da fic o e da mentira para colocar um espelho novo na hist ria que a ilumine de outra maneira de uma perspectiva contempor nea
971498 agora mais do que nunca depois de ter sido produtor de um filme e diretor de outro al m de escritor defendo a import ncia que tem um roteirista sobretudo se uma obra original
971499 acredito que no escritor se manifesta o mundo interno do filme seus temas sua vida sumamente importante quem escreve o filme e isso digo tamb m agora depois da experi ncia como diretor
971500 n o h honra maior do que ser lido em outro pa s
971501 recebi outro dia uma carta de um pres dio no estado de s o paulo dizendo que o b falo da noite era um dos livros favoritos da biblioteca de l mas que s havia um perguntaram se eu n o podia mandar outros esse tipo de carta me motiva muito foi escrita em portunhol quero ver direito de onde veio para mandar uns 50 exemplares
971502 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
971503 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
971504 this time bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse
971505 today it is a cab driver but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner
971506 es devastador ver a la gente enfermar y morir mientras esperan semanas e incluso meses para empezar un tratamiento simplemente por el hecho de que no hay suficientes profesionales sanitarios para proporcion rselos
971507 la excesiva carga de trabajo los infrasalarios y la infravaloraci n que reciben los m dicos en el continente m s afectado por la epidemia de sida hacen que la escasez de ellos crezca al mismo ritmo que los nuevos contagios por vih
971508 en el distrito de thyolo en malawi una enfermera se hace cargo de 400 pacientes que necesitan los medicamentos antirretrovirales para seguir vivos el salario de esta mujer de quien dependen tantas vidas no llega a los 3 d lares diarios
971509 es intolerable escuchar a los gobiernos de los pa ses ricos decir que no hay fondos para subirle el sueldo
971510 con el entrenamiento y apoyo adecuado las enfermeras y sanitarios podr an alcanzar a muchos m s pacientes y evitar que muchos de ellos abandonen la terapia
971511 la frustraci n tanto de los especialistas que se quedan como de los pacientes que atienden es cada vez mayor esperar d as y d as en una cl nica para que te vea un m dico o simplemente para que te hagan una prueba es demasiado
971512 men trots irritationen kommer jag inte ifr n att tematiken b rjar leva sitt eget liv i mitt huvud med den p f ljd att jag dagen efter lyssnar till vinden p ett nytt s tt

971522 you are an insightful and engaging presenter and your program far exceeded my expectations
971523 those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must like men undergo the fatigue of supporting it
971524 men fight for liberty and win it with hard knocks their children brought up easy let it slip away again poor fools and their grandchildren are once more slaves
971525 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
971526 liberty is always dangerous but it is the safest thing we have
971527 it is easy to take liberty for granted when you have never had it taken from you
971528 my god how little do my countrymen know what precious blessings they are in possession of and which no other people on earth enjoy
971529 liberty means responsibility that is why most men dread it
971530 this nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave
971531 we will always remember we will always be proud we will always be prepared so we may always be free
971532 you are an insightful and engaging presenter and your program far exceeded my expectations
971533 this contribution will be credited to knitters for obama fundraising goal
971534 many are unconvinced that either presidential candidate would be better than the other at fixing the ailing economy or improving the health care system
971535 incorrigibly fond of perhaps the least conservative and therefore the most absurd proposition ever penned by a political philosopher thomas paines we have it in our power to begin the world over again no we dont
971536 sweeping changes are almost always calamitous consequences of calamities wise voters hanker for candidates whose principal promise is that they will do their best to muddle through without breaking too much crockery
971537 the only way were going to get action to cut carbon emissions id suggest is if those who stand in the way of action come to be perceived as not just wrong but immoral
971538 harm the rights of international federations to set qualification criteria
971539 the cas panel found that schuettler was among the top players eligible for the olympics according to the itf criteria set up in their rules and that there was a discretion in the german noc to enter the players of its choice from among such eligible players
971540 the german noc did enter nicolas kiefer and schuettler but chose not to enter gremelmayr and michael berrer although both were ranked higher than rainer schuettler in the itf ranking list
971541 the itf is very disappointed with the decision and feels that the precedent set today could ultimately harm the rights of international federations to set qualification criteria and puts the role of the international federation in the olympic games into discussion
971542 it is very disturbing for the itf and should be for the ioc olympic organising committee when players who do not meet the itf qualification criteria approved by the ioc are entered at the expense of players who qualified and deserve to represent their countries at the 2008 olympic games
971543 every tennis event around the world uses the world ranking as the basis for entry and the itf finds it difficult to accept that criteria can be changed from country to country depending on the views of particular nocs
971544 while recognising that the german noc may not understand how professional tennis works there is no excuse for schuettler who is prepared to take a place that was earned by his compatriot gremelmayr and of next alternate berrer the itf wishes him the best of luck even if he was not eligible for beijing
971545 olympic gold is the only one missing from the set
971546 were better primed than weve ever been its going to be really tough everybody wants the gold medal but thats the level were aiming at
971547 the womens quad seem to represent our best chance of gold the first ever by gb women katherine is a fine ambassador for that crew and her commitment and longevity speak volumes about her
971548 im hugely proud of them both and everything that theyve meant to me
971549 i underestimated the importance of this flight in public opinion
971550 i have asked the supervisory boards administration to bill me in full for the flight
971551 you want to get closer to the top management and belong instead of having your ear tuned to the base
971552 there was a deep roaring sound like a bomb raid
971553 my wife was watching television then suddenly my daughter cried out my shutters exploded and part of our roof flew off
971554 the windows of my apartment suddenly blew up i lay down on the ground i just thought i was going to die
971555 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
971556 following meetings held throughout the day by the israel defence forces army and the security establishment the idf is preparing to transfer the rescued fatah operatives
971557 israel and the idf both of whom operate according to humanitarian values in order to save lives took action both on sunday and again today when a danger to the mens lives became apparent
971558 he worked yesterday just like any other day then in the evening death came quickly i am in mourning but i also express gratitude to everyone who will remember this moment remember solzhenitsyn
971559 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
971560 like millions of citizens solzhenitsyn lived through tough times he was one of the first to talk about the inhumane stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
971561 changed the consciousness of millions of people forcing them to think more about the past and the present
971562 we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity
971563 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history
971564 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
971565 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
971566 one of the things i think people forget in the midst of some of this is how firmly and strongly the south korean people believe in the american relationship
971567 ive told the president i make no promises except ill push as hard as i possibly can to get it done before i leave the presidency
971568 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do

971581 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture
971582 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
971583 he was responsible for all the issues related to the armed forces and the baath party the syrian ruling party all the reports regarding the baath party released by the syrian army went through his office and were presented to assad by him
971584 there is no doubt that the syrian regime is in a bad and complex situation there is no doubt that muhammed suleiman was one of the closest people to president bashar assad and his right hand in the armed forces
971585 he knew everything and all issues were open to him including the security economic and armament issues
971586 suleimans status exceeded his military rank and therefore he had no political aspirations his status was even more important than that of the defense minister
971587 in the meantime however it is hard to determine the reasons behind the assassination we must wait three or four more days for things to become clear particularly when we are talking about an accurate assassination which was carried out by a sniper firing from the sea
971588 camp david invitation is a plum for world leaders so the friendly treatment for an oil rich persian gulf nation sends a signal about just how important the united states considers the tiny emirates
971589 the ruler of dubai is an important figure in the emirates and an influential figure around the world
971590 el desarrollo del estatuto catal n y del esquema de financiaci n auton mica en l dise ado es un asunto
971591 typically the candidates cabin is like business class roomier and less chaotic than the staff and press areas but still short of the accoutrements of a pro teams charter
971592 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
971593 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
971594 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
971595 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
971596 though president bush and other backers of new drilling acknowledge it wouldnt directly affect gas prices for years
971597 would a president obama get congressional republicans to make deals on his major initiatives in his first year
971598 would president mccain meet stiff opposition from democrats on capitol hill
971599 do you get ptsd because you have a small hippocampus or does a small hippocampus mean youll develop ptsd that we still dont know
971600 they want to know these answers now which is the right approach we want the answers now people are still going off to the war coming back and a lot of them are suffering for a long time
971601 were using this opportunity to also see why some people are able to walk away from these situations and live healthy lives
971602 theyll have fewer nightmares and feel better during the day
971603 the healthier their personnel the better off the army is
971604 its hard for me to understand sen mccains argument he was telling me i was supposed to take this trip he suggested it thought it was a good idea
971605 john mccain has visited every one of these countries post primary that i have he has given speeches in canada in colombia mexico
971606 so it doesnt strike me that weve done anything different than the mccain campaign has done which is to recognize that part of the job of the next president and commander in chief is to forge effective relationships with our allies
971607 zo zo op vakantie waar gaat de reis naar toe
971608 i thought dan was an owner we all did because he passed himself off as one
971609 i never met the real owners until all of this came to light i think that was by dans design so wed have no one higher up to talk to about his behavior

971644 certainly we have opened the door for the immense attention that we have received some fair some unfair maybe
971645 the bottom line is that we opened the door for it and it comes with the territory anytime you do that you can expect negative reporting because they were reporting on things that were negative i think that is only fair the only thing that i would include there is that i dont think any coach on our staff myself included or any player offered any excuses and we will remain consistent on that front
971646 this stuff cant keep happening if guys dont start getting the point then they dont deserve to be part of the iowa football team
971647 we finished up 1 5 in the 06 season and started out 2 4 this past season and you throw in a loss to a very talented texas team somewhere in between there
971648 if you want to look at the 12 game period or the 13 game period including the bowl i think it is fair to say that our production was less than we had hoped
971649 i think changes need to be made on the offensive side of the ball
971650 i havent been that impressed with them on offense and its a highly paid staff that doesnt want to leave i think ferentz has surrounded himself with a lot of buddies on that staff and thats sometimes not a good thing
971651 you have heard me make this observation you look at all the time and money the pros get and you look at the mistakes that are made
971652 it happens in college recruiting everywhere in every sport that is just the nature of the beast it has gotten tougher because the exposures to players is less than it has ever been with players committing earlier than they ever have
971653 the earlier a player commits the less information you have the other aspect is the litigious nature of our society and people are less likely to be forthcoming with information in the recruiting process that is one of the realities that we deal with and it is a challenge then again there are a lot of challenges and i am not sitting here complaining about it but it is a reality
971654 our goals are really to help our players particularly our younger players i think thats been a constant that a lot of the bad decisions have been made by players in their first and second years on campus
971655 so our goal with the position is going to be better supplement the coaching staff better help our players with the transition just another person for them to have to meet with and visit with perhaps offer a little bit more accountability for our young people the overall goal is to help educate them a little bit more to the environment that they walk into
971656 anytime you go through turbulence as we have for change to happen people have to think smarter and we need more proactive behavior from players on our football team
971657 again i am not offering up excuses we were a young immature football team on the football field last year and i think it showed in many instances and i think that is part of the problem why we struggled off the field
971658 ive been losing lots of keys lately dont know what that means but maybe id be better off with things that cant be locked at all
971659 it is time for blacks to begin the shift from a wartime to a peacetime identity from fighting for opportunity to the seizing of it

971661 it is time for blacks to begin the shift from a wartime to a peacetime identity from fighting for opportunity to the seizing of it
971662 racism is simply an ugly form of collectivism the mindset that views humans only as members of groups and never as individuals

971665 it is time for blacks to begin the shift from a wartime to a peacetime identity from fighting for opportunity to the seizing of it
971666 while some conservatives would like to write off the nations african american community as a hopeless arm of the democrats an energized growing independent segment within the community is independently and stubbornly cracking that false monolithic image

971676 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
971677 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
971678 because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain
971679 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
971680 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
971681 what we want to see is these 3 500 pipes reviewed quickly so that if any of them are causing serious environmental problems it can be dealt with
971682 what we would like to see from the courts are greater fines handed out to water companies for pollution offences
971683 we have identified around 3 500 remaining temporary consents for cso discharges
971684 these are mainly for storm overflows that are operating without causing problems
971685 as youd expect our priority has always been to focus on those consents that are a problem
971686 we expect companies to be proactive in identifying intermittent discharges such as cso and emergency overflows from pumping stations that are at risk of becoming unsatisfactory
971687 we used absolutely the minimum force necessary to ensure safe access and entry routes to and from the site
971688 the police are claiming the vehicles were blocking the emergency exit and were abandoned both of which are lies

971700 the costs being incurred by organic producers are rising much faster than for conventional production
971701 the price we get currently for organic milk is not high enough to cover the cost of production there will have to be an increase in the price that producers receive
971702 in this context it is no longer attractive for conventional farms to convert and we are seeing producers undergoing conversion exiting that process the concern is that the relatively small number of leavers becomes a mass exit among existing producers
971703 there is a real danger that a supply shortage could take hold rather quickly if just 30 of our larger organic farms revert to non organic production we will lose 10 per cent of our supplies
971704 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers
971705 it is a bitter irony for us but after so many years of talking about the virtues of growing your own and british produce people are doing it and it is resulting in a fall in trade

971812 you have to have more contact than just like grabbing a handle to see a burn injury from a piece of equipment on the hottest days of the year when those pieces of equipment are too hot the kids tend to not even want to be on the playground for a long period momentary grabbing of something thats hot shouldnt be enough time for exposure its not like touching a flame or something that would burn more quickly
971813 the north east sector is an area which has been identified as an area for planned and managed growth and rackheath is a part of this we would want any houses planned to be as carbon neutral as possible for environmental reasons and also to keep fuel bills affordable for the generations of families we hope will live in them the most important next step now is to talk to local residents about how they would like to see their community grow and develop we are looking forward and planning for the long term needs of our communities managed growth needs to be sustainable and well thought through with jobs and infrastructure to support any growth
971814 rackheath is a much better option than coltishall for meeting the governments eco town objectives it is better prepared to shoulder new infrastructure and the local landowners are ready for development most importantly the plans are already going through a comprehensive rigorous and democratic planning process so local people will be fully involved along the way
971815 if the government wants to see an eco town and rackheath is considered suitable then it must fund the infrastructure to provide it and that includes the northern distributor road thats the deal norfolk people would expect us to agree and which they would support they should not be short changed on this
971816 i cannot put into words how angry we all feel at the time wasted on pursuing the ill thought out option 1 the independent panel report was damming and demonstrated how that the decision made by the former guildford and waverley pct to go ahead with option 1 was flawed and did not serve to improve services for local people surrey pct have continued on the same path for the last 18 months and although a relief to all to see option 1 formally bite the dust we now start yet down the road of yet another process many of the points raised by the panel were exactly those that i and many others made 2 years ago i have written to both the pct and the health and scrutiny committee voicing my concerns whilst we welcomed the chairmans decision to take questions at the board meeting we got few answers and information given to the board prior to their decision to continue with the closures at cranleigh were simply inaccurate we will all be watching the next steps of the pct with some care and caution i hope they dont underestimate the strength of feeling that exists in milford and cranleigh

971880 although judicial elections and contributions to elected judges are a well established means of selecting a state judiciary there will be rare cases where campaign expenditures by a litigant create a constitutionally unacceptable appearance of impropriety this is such a case

971894 at several of the public meetings i have held on the post offices proposed closures constituents have complained about the poor service at w h smiths with long queues can you imagine how much worse that would be if a large proportion of the customers who currently use forehill or newtonhead post offices go into the town for post office services
971895 when the move to w h smiths was first announced last summer i met with post office ltd and was given assurances that the high street post office would be able to cope with demand
971896 the uk drug crime commission has reported that drug crime is up 68 and we now have the worst record in europe the cost to the criminal justice system paid for by the taxpayer is 4billion a year

971901 the government has recognised the case for giving blind people access to the higher rate of mobility component of disability living allowance
971902 over the past year the government has been in discussion with the organisations involved on the precise detail and implementation of changes required to bring about a practical and robust solution but we now need confirmation of what action it will take to change the current entitlement criteria
971903 we need a prompt resolution to this matter and to end the exclusion of blind people from this very important extra cost benefit especially as they face some of the greatest barriers to independent mobility
971904 with the volume of work we are getting there needs to be someone to make sure people are orderly
971905 court filings were down drastically here prior to my arrival now they have drastically gone up

971916 i believe that beijings olympics are now facing real threats from terrorist attacks
971917 i think the olympics are the most important international sports event in four years
971918 and its the biggest focus of the international media in four years so this might draw some attention from terrorist groups
971919 the threat remains moderate but slightly elevated because of the olympics
971920 they local residents were exposed to cattle rustling after security was withdrawn to deal with the post election violence
971921 there were also high levels of poverty in the area after the conflict
971922 we thought the best way of getting effective aid to these people was cash
971923 if the markets work there is no point in us buying goods taking them to the area and distributing them we might not get the type of goods required right and there are also issues to do with trucking food cash made much more sense
971924 these people are mobile so they can go wherever they can get cheap food and the mobiles reduced their isolation
971925 if there is money the food will come merchants will come people suffer because they cant buy
971926 we found that one mobile phone per large group of people is not enough we will need to get more phones
971927 most of the projects that have used the mobile phone technology have been small in scale and preliminary probably due the high costs of developing and deploying mobile technologies
971928 provided the difference between wholesale and retail prices is within a certain range local food markets are actually functioning and that the cash transfer programme is long enough to justify the costs of the equipment phones chargers etc

971939 we are tired of staying in an idp camp many of us are not used to just sitting idle and living in tents such as these
971940 i had lived in kiambaa for 40 years i had a thriving bee keeping business and managed a tree nursery with my family
971941 but i am not going back because the people who burnt the church are still there the people who killed my child and my father are still there
971942 the idps are in dire need of food medical services sanitation and firewood for cooking
971943 water facilities at the church camp are overstretched we have had at least two deaths recently
971944 despite earlier forms of assistance such as tents from the un and food and medical aid from the kenya red cross the idps feel abandoned
971945 it is a bit over the top they had consulted cowes town council and we knew nothing about it what are you going to do about children wanting to go to the loo if they are penned in i just believe the whole situation is ridiculous
971946 it will create more problems than it solves it is excessive and demeaning to pen mums dads and their children in is just outrageous
971947 people are going to be put off by the fences it is going to halt passing trade it is completely unnecessary
971948 though we do not foresee difficulties we would nevertheless repeat our advice to revellers to avoid using the bridge unless absolutely necessary and to use instead other excellent vantage points such as east cowes seafront to watch the display
971949 it was the best experience ever you could never top it
971950 we jumped from above the clouds into free fall for about 7 000ft before our chutes opened at 6 000ft it was amazing

971956 by 2001 this intergovernmental panel on climate change managed to establish a consensus phrased so cautiously that scarcely any expert dissented
971957 some republicans think that all mr mccain has to do is disqualify mr obama
971958 according to this view as a long serving senator with a military record he seems safe next to a young and inexperienced senator
971959 mccain and his team have run a barrage of negative television ads and made personal attacks that have had political commentators suddenly staring jaws agape at the republican in other ads mr mccains attacks make substantial charges that are false or wildly exaggerated
971960 mccain has joined the attack but his grim repetitions of these assaults which suggest that mr obama does not care for his country risk turning off those independent voters he needs focusing relentlessly on mr obamas negatives cannot help but damage what was once most endearing about the republican
971961 if mr mccain keeps up his full assault he risks souring not only the press but those voters drawn to his old independent streak

971968 op de laatste drie albums van soulfly hoor je bijvoorbeeld ook veel flamenco en akoestische stukken allemaal door mij bedacht en ingespeeld ze waren natuurlijk altijd al erg experimenteel en vernieuwend ik heb ze enkel wat over de drempel geholpen
971969 we hebben het hier altijd erg naar onze zin en amsterdam is een leuke stad zo heb ik net wat shirts gekocht bij independent outlet dat we hier zo vaak staan is echter puur toeval onze toer concentreert zich vooral op de grote festivals de lege plekken ertussen hebben we zoveel mogelijk proberen op te vullen met zalen
971970 een erg mooie zaal eigenlijk niet erg vergelijkbaar met de andere zalen waarin we spelen ze zijn allemaal verschillend en hebben andere grootten
971971 wanneer ik weer solo ga toeren dan kom ik trouwens zeker weer terug naar amsterdam jullie zijn hier altijd erg supportive nederland is altijd erg goed geweest voor ill ni o en soulfly
971972 samen met mijn broer luke heb ik de platenmaatschappij we zijn van plan om hier binnenkort weer wat bands bij te tekenen ook heb ik een gitaarboek dvd uitgebracht die erg metalgericht is die is on line te bestellen
971973 ik ben nog erg jong en houd me voor alles open de toekomst ligt nog helemaal voor me
971974 ik ben erg blij dat ik het druk heb stilzitten is namelijk niks voor mij nadat soulfly klaar is met toeren duik ik gelijk weer de studio in voor mijn derde soloplaat die erg cool gaat worden

971984 about the time you think youve seen it all but you havent seen it all i dont know how to describe it really its almost indescribable its such a tragic thing
971985 looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled
971986 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you says the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you a future and a hope

972092 as a batsmen he has been one of the finest cricketers this country has seen and he took the england captaincy to new heights since assuming the role in 2003
972093 michael has been the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the type of character he has instilled in the england dressing room over the past six years
972094 as a leader he has proved to be a team player in every sense of the word with a ruthless edge that has led to england

972118 we went on a day that was too cold to go swimming there were a lot of homeless people on the boardwalk which was kind of run down the only beach i had ever been to was myrtle beach and this was nothing like that
972119 we took a class before we went down there and were told what to expect the cooks are guys who used to be homeless and ate there themselves and have come out of it and are now in culinary school
972120 one of the guys we talked to said he ended up homeless because of drugs and his family didnt want anything to do with him
972121 we saw one homeless guy come in talking on a blue tooth so maybe his house or apartment burned down and he didnt have anywhere to go the majority of the homeless people we talked to were very grateful and upbeat about life i dont know if id be like that if i were living on the street
972122 one day we went and handed out flyers to kids when they got out of school then we set up in a park and did a puppet show to teach the kids about god

972132 every city has a single word that defines it that identifies most people who live there if you could read peoples thoughts as they were passing you on the streets of any given place you would discover that most of them are thinking the same thought whatever that majority thought might be that is the word of the city and if your personal word does not match the word of the city then you dont really belong there
972133 what was the word in your family when you were growing up
972134 the taoist view of the transformation of emotional energy differs radically from the cathartic practices of either eastern kundalini or western group therapy in the shaktipat kundalini practice catharsis is sometimes called kriya or action here the idea in the early developmental stages is to discharge emotional energy by various actions such as screaming yelling crying curling into the fetal position moving through blocked emotional states until they are freed up in group therapy from primal scream to encounter bioenergetics and psychodrama the idea is to emote your pain and agony externally the louder the better heaping verbal and physical abuse on a pillow or a person as the case may be though these approaches are sometimes successful the ancient taoists detected an inherent problem with such techniques
972135 when pressure builds up in a pressure cooker there are within the cathartic model only three options you have to handle the situation 1 turn the heat off i e deny repress 2 let some steam out at intervals or 3 let all the steam out at once turning the heat off leaves the basic emotional situation unchanged if you only let steam partially out after a period the pressure will build to again reach a critical level all the steam can be let out of a trapped emotion at one blow but the reality is that this particular event rarely occurs far more common for people with emotional blockages is that they let some but not all of the emotional pressure out and then as mentioned the pressure rebuilds until they have to cathart again
972136 the cathartic release of violent emotions irritates and exhausts the system and can sometimes foster an addictive need to feel those violent emotions in ever stranger forms cathartic methods may easily turn practitioners into therapy junkies angry people become angrier still for instance or depressed people sink deeper into depression while deluding themselves into thinking that they are working on self improvement

972138 effective working of the partnership relies on there being trust respect and confidence between the two groups
972139 because of the recent unilateral actions by the conservative leadership these no longer exist and are not likely to in the near future
972140 its simply that the events of the last two weeks have led to a breakdown in trust between the groups
972141 the liberal democrat group cannot see how we can continue to work with the current conservative leadership

972143 if you had invested 10 000 rupees in the sensex or the nifty stock index one year back
972144 your investment would have shrunk to about rs 8 800
972145 however a similar amount invested in gold would have grown to over rs 15 000
972146 its the uncertainty in the financial markets that is propelling gold upwards
972147 the rural poor account for two thirds of annual gold purchases small scale farmers have traditionally used spare cash to invest in small pieces of gold jewelry because in the face of economic and political uncertainty they favor gold above paper assets
972148 practically its portability makes it easier to keep safe and secure than cash
972149 and even if they overcame their suspicions of paper assets such as equities or government bonds most of indias rural population either lack sufficient capital or access to banks to make that feasible
972150 much of indias informal credit system is backed by gold and of course religious and cultural attachments not least the idea that gold given to women as a wedding gift remains her own property are strong
972151 india is a market well known for its price sensitivity

972165 each individual brings a uniques light into the world however often that light remains buried below the surface of the person others see in us discovering that light and letting it shine is one of the fundamental steps each individual must take to become a more whole person
972166 god loves you because you are perfect just the way that you are
972167 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we are all meant to shine as children do we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us its not just in some of us its in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

972173 blame and resentment are the toxic emotions that keep us stuck inside the smallness of our stories woven throughout our personal dramas is an underlying conversation that might sound like this look what you did to me you screwed up my life im a nothing just like you or im never going to amount to anything just like you told me we hold others responsible for our deficiencies and then set out to prove that we have in fact been ill treated and wronged our poor me story becomes our evidence proving that weve been mistreated neglected or abused and every time we fall short of doing our best we have the perfect alibi we get to say if i hadnt had that angry father lousy girlfriend alcoholic mother or been raped molested beaten ignored abandoned called names i wouldnt be like this then we use every failure every disappointment every broken relationship or botched business deal to support our conviction that we have been victimized we continually sabotage our efforts toward success and happiness in order to hold on to our resentment and keep our stories intact our continued failures and misery prove to us that we are right and those we blame are wrong
972174 the people we blame offer a perfect excuse for our self sabotage
972175 they are not engaged getting married or any of the reports
972176 thats why we need a strong partnership between indigenous leadership our major companies as well as the government itself supporting this plan on the way through
972177 i remember being on the set of the second bridget jones with hugh grant one day and one of us asked the other do you remember saying yes to this no never did
972178 then once the process was in motion it had that kind of air of inevitability and then you would have had to be the one to unglue it all so if there was a third one it might be like that we might all come back as a kind of dysfunctional family again
972179 it would have to be pretty damn good i think
972180 pat how is life better for you when you face your fears
972181 tom how is life better for me when i face my fears life is better in so many ways the first time that i even realized that i had lived most of my childhood in fear i was 19 years old running down a dark country road to get away from my drunk abusive dad my sister was running right beside me we were running and i suddenly ralized that we had no where to go so we stopped running and walked back home i rmember thinking that i had never felt the fear before that night i had denied that i felt it or stuffed it deep inside me at that age i didnt know how to handle it i made the decision that night that i had to leave that home or i would go crazy or die that was when i found courage for the first time a few weeks later i had made arrangements with an older friend you will find my article about my friend althea at http patriciasingleton blogspot com 2007 06 most influencial person 2 survival html to live with her and get a summer job before going away for my junior year of college the next time that i actively started to look at all of the fears that i carried around was when i was 38 years old and in adult children of alcoholics aca and al anon meetings and a few months later in an incest survivor counseling group i remember sitting in an aca meeting and telling everyone that my fears were big enough to fill the entire room that we were sitting in that is the night that i started looking at my fears and whiddling away at those fears one fear at a time most of them were needless and unrealistic courage has become my constant companion instead of fear
972182 until we stop blaming ourself i think that this dynamic can keep the cycle of abuse going
972183 if someone loves me then they must abuse me and if they dont i need to find someone who will so i can be loved
972184 the blame cycle is often connected to the words we use to describe the event
972185 i do know that the judgments that we make about others are really about us

972209 as a foster mum i always got the kids that had a hard time i could understand their anger and frustration and the sense of being let down i often told them my own story
972210 it was something i could do at home while my own children were growing up and it was giving another child a normal home life
972211 as a foster parent you have to have sticking power i actually had people say to me i dont know how you can love them

972498 three years ago it would take us 50 to fill up a tank for a big 15 passenger van with a trailer now it takes that much to fill up my car
972499 i cant imagine what its costing some of the hardworking hustling bands that are on warped tour this year that are doing it in a van
972500 its definitely way more expensive to be in a bus than it is to be in a van
972501 you dont want to go back to the van but a lot of bands are having to go back
972502 im committed to what were doing this year i had an accountant saying maybe we should drop a stage i said no what were going to make someone stay home now hopefully were working every angle so a band doesnt have to drop off the tour
972503 im traveling with a lot of broke bands right now were a hard working tour this year in the long run there are some positives to it

972508 we only took note of the dead body when we saw people rushing to the scene thereby creating a traffic hold up honestly i cant say what possibly killed him because there are no indications of either gunshot or knife on the body maybe he passed on in his sleep anyway god knows best

972515 we expect that in this modern world automobiles should do it but not animals
972516 there is an endless squabble between us and vehicle drivers who accuse us of blocking the roads with our animals making them move at a very slow speed
972517 jigawa needs to make a giant stride towards providing efficient transport system in the state especially in the state capital
972518 we admonish them against maltreating the animals most especially starving them or allowing them to work without water and where an operator refuses to change we take stringent measures against him
972519 it is indeed unfortunate that since the creation of jigawa state over a decade ago the state is yet to have a town service transportation system
972520 it is high time that indigenes began to show their patriotism to their state by investing in the transportation business capable of solving the states transportation needs
972521 some government officials have visited us and organised an interactive session with us at the village heads house where they warned us against using any chicken that was destroyed in the process of preventing the disease from spreading to other farms

972526 looked in disgust at his fathers naked drunken sleeping body
972527 because hes been ill for quite a while like they say when a man is about 80 years and there have been symptoms of ill health he is expected to hear the call no matter how much we wish hed stayed longer
972528 he was not in pains though he was just indisposed
972529 i cant make that sharp distinction because he was always everything he influenced us in many ways careers religion and every sphere of our lives he was everything to us and we were so close to him well miss everything about him
972530 hes already immortalised himself he lived a good life and built a good name for himself and the family
972531 jose lived a full and exemplary life he was an institution in journalism politics and leadership in islam our hearts are broken allah will bless his soul
972532 the death of alhaji jose has robbed nigeria of a media icon a statesman and a nationalist par excellence
972533 though at 82 one would want to admit that alhaji jose was old it is a shock to learn that he has passed on giving that he has remained a reference point for media practice in nigeria
972534 his death is a minus to journalism in nigeria and indeed in africa
972535 jose remains the father of modern day journalism there is no medium that youll not find a product of jose in charge he exhibited courage and was a stickler to the best of ethics of journalism in the country so in death he is a fulfilled man because he lived to see many of his products rise to the highest level in all aspects of life
972536 jose was a devoted muslim leader who stood very strongly for the unity of the country and promoted decency in every sphere of life he was also a true patriot what was remarkable about him is the way he mentored the young especially in journalism
972537 jose was an outstanding leader in journalism he set standards in professional journalism which would be difficult for anybody to match
972538 he lived a good life and the legacy he left behind will be cherished by all journalists he trained many journalists and i am one of his products
972539 anybody who is a journalist will be proud of his accomplishments
972540 many nigerian journalists will miss him but we will emulate his ideals
972541 then he remains one individual whose ideals are worth emulating he would not only be missed by journalists but everyone who truly seeks to live uprightly
972542 while we received the news of his death with shock we are consoled by his legacies especially the path of honour truth and courage he laid for the nigerian press
972543 he meant everything to everyone in the journalism profession i myself am a product of joses training school
972544 jose had the chieftaincy title of bobatolu of ikare and by that he and myself shared the responsibility of ensuring the development of our birth place and by extension the nigerian society
972545 all journalists should learn to work very hard like him we have learnt from him that with hard work dedication and commitment the sky is the limit for every conscientious journalist
972546 whereas the openness of rational expressions to criticism and to grounding merely points to the possibility of argumentation learning processes through which we acquire theoretical knowledge and moral insight extend and renew our evaluative language and overcome self deceptions and difficulties in comprehension themselves rely on argumentation

972687 the light protest invites people to perform a simple task on a certain moment for a specific cause
972688 its a global tool for the unification of millions of people worldwide and it increases the power each of us has for the expression of our own stance a light protest will always stand for a higher cause such as human rights freedom thought or faith and will be pro bono and non violent
972689 we will also send letters to the chinese government and the un chief about the level of global participation
972690 were not against the olympics were just working towards freedom
972691 we hope your candle for tibet campaign will inspire the chinese authorities to appreciate the value of freedom of all mankind and the importance of the tibetan buddhist culture that is benefiting millions of people and has the potential to serve humanity as a whole including the chinese people
972692 like you his holiness the dalai lama and the tibetan government in exile is not against the olympics we are also not against the chinese people who also do not enjoy genuine human rights and freedom that the people in the free world take for granted

972696 al qaeda is not an outside enemy its not a question of whether there was foreknowledge of the attacks it has to do with the fact that al qaeda is a creature of the cia and has remained a creature of the cia right up until the present
972697 the commission found that comcast monitors its customers connections using deep packet inspection and then determines how it will route some connections based not on their destinations but on their contents
972698 in essence comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein the commission also found that comcasts conduct affected internet users on a widespread basis indeed comcast may have interfered with up to three quarters of all peer to peer connections in certain communities
972699 provide internet users with the opportunity to view high quality video that they might otherwise watch and pay for on cable television such video distribution poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand vod service
972700 we set a precedent on what isps can expect moving forward and we would consider fines in the future where we find violations but because this is the first action we took we are giving comcast an opportunity to say how and when they will stop these practices
972701 the company initially claimed that it did so interfered with attempts by customers to share files online using peer to peer applications only during periods of peak network congestion and of heavy network traffic
972702 later confronted with yet more evidence suggesting that interference was not limited in this manner comcast recast its position yet again and admitted that it interferes with peer to peer traffic regardless of the level of overall network congestion at the time and regardless of the time of day
972703 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
972704 we also believe that the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
972705 in a perfect world we would give free bandwidth to everyone in the current environment it comes down to who will pay for supporting the content online the user or the isp
972706 the key is to know how and what resources to utilize to gather the best information
972707 new users should know that there is a great community of linux users that are willingly dedicated to helping people with technical problems for absolutely nothing and those resources are available in a few different ways forums irc chat rooms mailing lists local linux user groups and a plethora of web sites dedicated to providing the community with linux how tos
972708 if i had to write a linux starters kit it would be along these lines
972709 windows users switching to linux need to understand packages and repositories
972710 repositories whether yum are the killer app for linux they provide the greatest single advantage over windows from an end user perspective
972711 but in reality installing linux software especially if its in your repositories is one of the easiest things you can do
972712 i recently read comments about someone who gave up on linux because they couldnt install family tree maker when a perfectly good alternative gramps was only an apt get away
972713 customization new linux users should be encouraged to customize their desktop
972714 not only will this show off the power of xfce compared to windows but it will get the user accustomed to the idea that they can and should make changes to their computer to make it look and feel and act the way they want it to every time i see a default ubuntu desktop i see a failure to teach someone about linux
972715 windows users are afraid of the command line and rightfully so its a scary place in windows if they think that they need the command line in linux then linux will scare them
972716 i think they should be exposed to the terminal told what the command line equivalent is of any gui action a gui focused how to or help guide tells them to do and again encourage them to play around in it
972717 making software free is what makes it work for them so it is important that they understand it
972718 once the users understand the philosophy of open source they can understand the open source community and why support forums are often better than an 800 number
972719 i think by far the easiest way to learn linux is to get together with others who know how to use linux
972720 after the user is started its much easier to use help pages to get the rest of the way
972721 seriously if one is technical and wants to learn linux i recommend buying one of many linux magazines they almost always have some distro cd with them in the stores then find an old machine around the house and install linux
972722 i tend to favor the oreilly books consider starting with linux in a nutshell
972723 start in the etc directory look at files ending in conf cfg rc look in the directory etc rc d init look at the startup scripts look in sbin and do man xxx on commands found there those are sysadmin commands youll learn about how to manage the system also look in usr sbin for some less pedantic admin commands
972724 start ls ing in bin usr bin and usr local bin do man xxx on anything that piques your curiosity
972725 if by now your curiosity isnt piqued stop youre not interested in linux
972726 if this got you started i apologize in advance for taking up the next few years of your life
972727 the first thing you need when learning linux is a solution
972728 for me windows was bloated and the switch to linux served a purpose
972729 id say the best way for a new user to get familiar with linux is to play with or install if a hard drives free one of the many excellent live cds available
972730 you no longer need to understand your system to pick which distro would work the best since just about every distro works the same todays installers will not only set up a working system but actually migrate your settings from your former operating system so that you dont really even need to configure it
972731 back in the day obtaining ice cream was a bit harder
972732 you made a decision on what flavor you wanted gathered the ingredients for that flavor made the ice cream and picked how you wanted to serve it
972733 some missing iphone features are bound to show up in future software updates
972734 with the launch of iphone 3g iphone os 2 0 with enterprise integration and app store iphone arguably has more functionality now than any other mobile platform
972735 while the app store has almost 1 000 applications for download right now theres still plenty of innovation to occur on this platform we are only a few weeks into the launch of a platform that will have a lifespan of a decade perhaps longer
972736 apple doesnt think its critical but im sick of remembering long urls uniform resource locators or phone numbers since theres not a frackin cut n paste feature
972737 crackberry has it ms windows ce devices windows mobile have it even free clam shell phones have it
972738 it always cracks me up when the super phone doesnt has have standard phone features
972739 i look at the n95 and drool over its camera the iphone takes worse pictures than my silly isight on my macbook pro
972740 lignite and hard coal energy suppliers for world needs until the year 2100 an outlook
972741 i t is important to estimate expected atmospheric co 2 levels for realistic estimates of fossil fuel reserves and to determine how the co 2 level depends upon possible constraints on coal use
972742 implications of peak oil for atmospheric co 2 and climate
972743 peak oil emission occurs in 2016 2 yr peak gas in 2026 2 yr and peak coal in 2077 2 yr
972744 is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their co 2 emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions
972745 e ven if coal reserves are much lower than historically assumed there is surely enough coal to take the world past 450 ppm co 2 without mitigation efforts such as those described here
972746 our producer limited profile has future fossil fuel production that is lower than all 40 of the ipcc scenarios so it seems that producer limitations could provide useful constraints in climate modeling
972747 the producer limited profile gives a peak of 460 ppm in 2070

972756 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
972757 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
972758 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
972759 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
972760 all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players
972761 if you want honest advice about your home dont listen to the people who are trying to make a living selling them
972762 granted lugo the loss of the clerical state with all the obligations as a priest and bishop of the society of the divine word
972763 his clerical state is not compatible with the presidency of the republic
972764 having examined all the circumstances carefully his holiness benedict xvi has granted him the loss of his clerical state with the consequent loss of its inherent rights
972765 to be faithful to the catholic faith in which he was baptized and to lead a life that is consistent with the gospel
972766 one of the most severe human rights violations and is a breach of israeli law and human morality
972767 they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
972768 everybody that comes into israel we have to question them about the reason they are coming especially if they are in a terror organization
972769 i think once a person decides to join a terror organization we do not have to bring them into israel for treatment hamas took over they should take care of these people
972770 we dont question that israel has to protect itself and that maybe it needs to find out something about a person who wants to enter our problem is that they are questioning patients about other people
972771 you are not allowed to use civilians as part of the conflict
972772 its too late now ive got other things to do
972773 st paul was the model of true conversion which is giving your life over to the lord in a radical and complete way in that way paul is a true convert and an example for all of us
972774 this book can change people it can bring catholics and protestants together pope benedict xvi emphasized that the pauline year is an ecumenical event thats why he invited so many other faiths to his declaration of the year of st paul
972775 because of the amazing grace that he received paul was able to spread the message of christ to many people
972776 we cant have any evangelization when people do not think that they are sick with sin and need help this is why paul uses the bad news to show that all people are sinful and then the good news with the faithfulness of god and promise to all his people is fulfilled in jesus christ
972777 benedict xvi said its not just a question of who was paul but who is paul and how he can speak to us today especially during this year
972778 by studying pauls letters and the acts of the apostles where we learn about pauls life we can appreciate what paul says because he was writing under the inspiration of the holy spirit and he continues to talk to us today
972779 catholics dont know gods words and how hes revealed himself in salvation history as well as not completely understanding the traditions of the catholic church as a result of not knowing gods word and the church they cant bridge the gap between faith and everyday life
972780 but scripture is filled with hope and truth studying the bible is about regaining our story and realizing who we are
972781 there is one thing we find in pauls writings and that is the knowledge of our god and father and of his son our lord jesus christ
972782 i know that many of you are worried some deeply worried by the threat of fragmentation at the heart of the anglican communion
972783 our great desire is that the anglican communion be united rooted in this historical faith which our dialogue and relationships over the course of four decades have brought us to believe is widely shared
972784 in light of the tensions of past years in regard to questions on human sexuality a clear declaration from the anglican communion would offer us greater possibilities to provide a common testimony on human sexuality and matrimony a testimony painfully necessary for the world of today
972785 i have to be clear concerning the new situation that has been created in our ecumenical relations if our dialogue has produced a significant accord on the idea of the priesthood the ordination of women to the episcopate substantially and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
972786 we desire the continuation of theological dialogue between the anglican communion and the catholic church
972787 but this last step undermines our objective and alters the level that we are seeking in dialogue now it seems that full visible communion as the objective of our dialogue has taken a step backward that our dialogue will have less defined objectives and therefore its nature will be changed
972788 to join in a day of prayer and fasting that such offenses never happen again
972789 reprehensible inexcusable and unconstitutional his flagrant display of irreverence by profaning a consecrated host from a catholic church goes beyond the limit of academic freedom and free speech
972790 attacking the most sacred elements of a religion is not free speech anymore than would be perjury in a court or libel in a newspaper
972791 expo zaragoza 2008 an international exposition being held in the spanish city of zaragoza from 14 june to 14 september on the theme

972795 it was amazing i thought with the economy down the fuel and everything we might be down but everyones come out to celebrate which is a good thing
972796 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
972797 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
972798 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
972799 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
972800 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now

972838 within all of the cluttered chaos and the unknown that i seem to be surrounded by here for some reason i feel more myself than i have in a long time more grounded in knowing how ungrounded i really am
972839 as it is i wake up at 5 am to do yoga eat breakfast either go on a field trip farm sit in class all day or hop on a 20 hour train ride and by the time the day is over there is absolutely no part of me at can do anything other than eat dinner shoot the shit and read about 2 pages and then fall asleep i havent written in my journal i havent written on my blog and i know i have not emailed
972840 well mt trip was certianly tremendous and wonderful it is 2 20 am and i just got back where exactly we went well i am not quite sure we went to the forest a beautiful forest the first day we drove for three hours on a bus and then got to this little run down hostel type deal and met with some village women and learned about self help groups and what they were doing in terms of tribal womens daily confrontations contradictions and problems then we went to a village and met with a man whose family was displaced by the construction of a large dam in the 60s we got to look at his crops and see how difficult it was for him to farm in such an arid region talked about how the government fucked him over and how he went from having 32 acres of land to 7000 rupees equivlent to about 160 dollars right across the fence was a large factory being constructed for the building of steel tractor parts then we went like fifteen minutes away and visited a woman in another village that had started a watershed forest restoration project and we got to hike into the hills learn about her trees and then have a question and answer session with her and some of the others in her village about livlihood challenges life and the likes we asked questions she askedquestions the sun set over the mountains and it was dark we went back to the fugi hostel place and had to meet with a guy from the conservative that works on convseration projects and forest managment one of the rangers who happen to have his most official training in the military not an uncommon phenomena finally dinner and beautiful sleep i slept outside under this little gazebo and convinced some others to sleep outside with me with out heads all facing the center making on flower like spiral woke up at the crack of dawn and did yoga i have been loving my early morning yoga and 6 am has become my favorite part of the day we are usually done by then then we went into the forest into the forest and got to lay off of the academics a little bit which was much well needed and i feel much ligher as a result we were all about to go nutz so we hiked to this little hut like cabin structure split into groups and went on a forest walk with a medicine man at night we sang christmas carols at the moon and ate roots by the fire then when i was finally thinking about it being bedtime we decided to go on a night walk up into the mountian into the steep dark forest the moon was so bright that everything glowed a florescent silver and got to meditate in silence for the first time in a long long while the next morning this morning i woke up with saachi to do yoga but our sleeping bags were wet and he said that if we did yoga in the wet cold like that we would both get sick again so i went back to sleep until the sky began to lighten up with pastels i opened my eyes and say the moon setting down over the opposite mountian bright pink we packed all of our shit up got on the bus and drove to this hot spring well it was not quite the same as what would come into your mind when you think hotspring it was located in this little village fish market that smelled like exactly what it was it was like a small square public black smelly pool that happened to be of natural orgin and sulfur contents nevertheless i got in and enjoyed it for what it was it made me dream of the hotsprings in the snow in utah that you have told me about and made me laugh at myself for being in a hotspring in the heat of the day on christmas eve then we went to a sacred forest and visited the shrine of a powerful goddess i will have to tell you stories later as it is getting late and my head is begining to hurt but quickly upon leaving the sacred shrine five minutes into our bus ride our bus broke down and we were stranded on in the sacred forest on the side of the road below an amazing mountian side for the next six hours saachi read peoples palms i watched got mine read and watched some more my friend is teaching me how to learn healing touch which is a form of energy healing so i exerimented trying to feel the energy of different healthy and sick trees it is interesting i have a much easier time feeling the energy fields of plants than of people o k so i realize that might make you think that i am going absolutely nutz so that is all that i will say for break new years to answer your question i am going to the himalayas and staying at this guy that i met in sewagrams natural medicine and yoga center he has one empty room that he has offered to me and five of my friends for practically free we have to provide for our food and bring our sleeping bags that is it it is 2 km outside of dharm salla i think that is how you spell it the town itself is quite touristy which is why i was only going to go if we could find a connection of someone to stay with outside of the city well done on i am excited but anyways five hours after the bus had originally broken down it began to get dark originally we had planned on getting back around 3 or 4 or maybe even 5 and had plans with our host families and then to eventually meet up at a midnight mass for those who wanted seeing as this was not going to happen it being 9 o clock we got birthday candles stood in a circle read the nativity scene silently lit our little candles and sang silent night followed by many other christmas delights there are many more interesting ironic and beautiful details that i will have to tell you in person because some things are just better that way nevertheless let it be said that i had a very very memorable christmas eve when they finally fixed the bus we all clapped cheered and kept singing our christmas carols only to find ourselves stopped by the side of the road again no more than 15 minutes later it has been a long night and it is finally time for sleep i just wanted to email you and tell you merry christmas eve i love you tons and wish you a lovely lovely day p s sorry if this sounded jumbled hope you enjoyed it anyhew
972841 i love india so much it is insane this evening i was walking and i came across this little resturant that said that they had chips and salsa i almost wet my pants i was so excited so i went in and ordered some and sat with the couple that owned the resturant warming my hands in front of their space heater it is damn cold here i walk around in blankets but back to the chips they thinly sliced potatoes fried them and gave me spicy homemade ketchup tasting sauce not quite the way they do it in california but even the thought that they tried made me really happy i miss salsa and mexican food and salads and the likes last night i learned how to cook kashmirian food i bought a hat from this kid and then he invited us all over for dinner at his house we ate amazingly spicy vegtables and rice it was delicious everywhere you go here people make you come in and drink a cup of chai even in the big cities people here are warm and friendly and from what i have experienced very honest in their intentions there are tons of tibeten refugees around here as well so i have gotten to learn about that whole ordeal as well sorry if this is scattered as always
972842 it is 10 miles up and my friend tanner went and showed me the most incredible pictures that i have ever seen did i mention that i love it here i think that i did yesterday i went to a tibeten cultural institute about an hour away by myself thank god i had never realized how much i need alone time until being on this trip with so many awesome people that are always doing cool things and so it is hard not to be with them 24 7 but anyhew there was a beautiful temple with a huge gold idol and so then i went to a monestery and talked to a monk for awhile then i heard loud bells ringing and within 15 minutes the temple was full of monks rocking back and forth and practicing their tibeten chants i stayed inside watching and listening for awhile i was watching this one monk and in my head i thought about focusing on his voice with the others in the background and as soon as that thought went through my head he looked up at me then i felt like i was intruding a little bit seeing as i was the only non monk there and i was just sitting there watching them s o i left and came back into town town was absolutely nutz because a lot of indian and israeli tourists come here for new years there are beggars on the street little children that are very persistant to say the least so a few days ago i had bought one of the street kids milk and then the next day i bought his friend crackers and then the next day same same they come up to you and ask you to go to the store and buy them food not to give them money so after learning that they just sell the milk back to the stores for money and dont actually eat drink it i stopped being so generous plus milk is pretty expensive but i just cant look at these kids without wanting to do whatever i can anyway when i got back into town this kid followed me for like 30 minutes and when i went to the coffee shop to sit down he waited outside i went out to talk to him and explain that he needed to go away and these three indians started talking to me i talked to them they helped translate to the kid to stop following me and then proceeded to not leave me alone for an entire cup of coffee get rid of one follower and find three more i was walking home in a pissed off fluster because being what seemed to be the only woman in the midst of lots of men looking for a party led to obnoxious harrasment and i met this couple from dehli that was looking to get away from the secene in town as well i took them back to my hotel and we decided to go to this waterfall that is in the mountians behind where i am staying we took a short cut got lost watched the sun set behind the mountains standing on a very steep mountain with a jagged cliff where our short cut had ended eventually we found the waterfall and sat by in the dark and drank chai tea the sun is setting so i want to go outside but to finish giving you a little wrap up of my day yesterday for new years eve we went to this students for free tibet party in the hills got really drunk danced the night away
972843 luckily i found this cool little cafe with relatively cheap and fast internet and i have the day off so i am using the time to do some research i have to turn in the first chapter of my yearlong project which i am writing on land covservation parks vs people the long relationship between humans and nature cows and how these all of these things play out in relation to the maasai i have to write another paper on social movements in africa and their relationship to colonialism and then i am doing a photo essay for my environmental policy class on water consumption and water scarcity here in tanzania so i have a pretty full plate at the moment i downloaded some pictures from the drives that we have taken on our traveling days a few of my roomate and i taking bored posed pictures one of the whole group at my birthday celebration dinner a few from the days we spent learning about a kick ass sisal farm in mambo a small little town in the north east as well as a few others hopefully they will help to give you a little better idea of where i am and what the hell i am doing round here the morning after i talked to you we drove 6 hours to mambo and went to a sisal farm to learn about sisal production and this really neat company called katani basically when the sisal farms were privatized from the government in 1983 or somewhere around there maybe it was 93 i forget this man bought the land with 8 of his friends and started a sisal production company they have divided the land into 15 acre parsals that they give to local families under the condition that they continue to harvest sisal crops on them during the first two to three years they can grow susbstinence crops on the land in between the sisal crops and thus make an income off of the land as well as feed themselves and their families sisal is a type of yuca cactus that was brought from mexico by the germans in the late 1800s and it requires very very very little water it can survive happily off of the water that it gets from annual rain fall and if there is a drought it goes dormant and can survive for up to four years it helps the soil that it grows in and makes it more nutrient rich so that when the families do grow their own crops they do better then they otherwise would in the not so lush savanah soil most of the sisal is exported in the form of a fiber that people use to make carpets ropes and other durable things out of but the usable fiber only accounts for 4 of the plant leaves they have figured out that they can make biogas out of the 96 of the leaf that is usually wasted and the farm that we visited is the first sisal biogas plant that has ever been sucessfully integrated into sisal production really cool they use the biogas to then run their machienery and nearby houses etc the only other little bit of waste that is produced is this super nitrogen rich sludge that they then sell as fertilizer anyway it was really coool to see and very inspiring to see an instance of development in which export maintains nationalism as a priority as it is community based and if for some reason the sisal market fails they are still producing their own energy haha sorry if you didnt want to know all of that it was just the most exciting thing that i have seen on this trip and so i wanted to share now i am in moshi we went to a coffee factory yesterday which was kind of cool but also a little bit boring but tomorrow we have the option between going to a coffee plantation farm or the coffee auction where the coffee is sold into the international market i am going to go to the auction because while i am sure that there will be another opportunity to go to a coffee farm i do not think that finding an auction in the future will be likely on a completely other note i have been having a little bit of a hard time with the whole idea of abroad expereince as something for us my group to consume there have just been some instances in the past few days where i am feeling like many of the people on this group expect their culture their desires their wants their academics and their ideas about how things should be to be catered to by the ihp faculty the country coordinator and the people that live here its just the difference between seeing our expereinces as commodity and entitlement rather than exchange and privledge likewise i think that most if not all of our group problems would be completely solved if everyone made a very concious effort to be self aware of the space that they take up and how they go about doing that and observant of its repercussions this morning i went to this optional class that fatma alloo held up until this morning i have been defending her to others in our group but without knowing why there are people that have been all upity about her seeming to be an elistist who is unwilling to hear other peoples voices and more as a arogant silencer than anything else well the true story is is that she is responsible for starting the biggest womens rights movments that tanzania has ever known she started an organization called tamwa with 10 other female journalists and since it first began there are now alomost 400 other journalist women working alongside her to let the voices of a mulititude of opressed women be heard she first started working because she was fighting with her husband about money he wanted her to cook but wouldnt let her leave the house and wouldnt give her money to buy food so that she could cook it she got a job working for the liberation movement offive in the 70s and got arrested for her journalism and eventually divorced as a result she also initiated the formation of an unregistered coalition called femact which is a coalition of all of the different womens organizations in tanzania the point of having it unregistered is so that it is off of the government radar of control she has spent most of her life fighting for womens rights in a country where the large percentage of tanzania is muslim and even where the muslim religion is no where to be found women are still raped beaten and denied the access to the ownership of anything and as a result tons of other organizations have sprung out of her work and they have also gotten a lot of legislation passed just as the illegalization of female genital mutilation and most recently an in 2005 a land act that now allows women to hold land in their own name moral of the story her documentaries and journal publications include instances such as a woman get raped by 14 men to death etc and my initial impressions of her as the most intense and at times overvoiced feminist that i have ever met have changed to straight up respect sorry for totally bantering i hope that i am not boring you with things that you dont care to hear about i know none of it is exactly relevant information but it is just kind of what came out when i started typing
972844 since you last heard from me i have been living with the masaai people sweating my life away in little huts with a fire in the middle that they use for cooking and absolutely no form of ventilation system or even hole for the smoke and heat to get out of while sleeping next to three other people in a space that i could easily occupy
972845 environmental equity i shit in my garden thats equity eh the spuds come up every year

972851 it is quite difficult to maintain any moral stance in a corrupt financial system lessmoney you have the more you can hang onto your morals
972852 to me i guess sustainability is being able to get up in the morning and being able to do it again

972857 unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
972858 welcome to the world of winning the first of many
972859 today we have reached a point where the availability of information in electronic form whether on edgar or a company web site is the superior method of providing company information to most investors as compared to other methods
972860 be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
972861 now i recognize my opponent came before you yesterday he attacked my record on education reform
972862 this is someone whos been in washington nearly 30 years hes got a pretty slim record on education and when he has taken a stand hes been on the wrong side of the line
972863 thats why if you think about this week what theyve been good at is distraction
972864 youve got statistics saying weve lost another 50 000 jobs that floridas in recession for the first time in a decade and a half and what was being talked about were paris and britney and so theyre clever on creating distractions from the issues that really matter in peoples lives
972865 thats something thats being fed to the media by them and i think what would be useful is to ask the question whats this based on if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week im beat
972866 what i think weve got to do is just keep on driving home the essential message of this campaign which is weve got to change business as usual
972867 weve got to change economic policies and weve got to change washington and weve got to change how our politics is done
972868 i f youre looking for the right word to sum up mccains week try one of these desperate dishonorable outright lies off the mark nasty the gutter baloney or baseless
972869 mccain may be proud of his shameful campaign tactics but the voters expect and deserve better
972870 u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices obama said
972871 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done obama said
972872 h e told the post he would be open to expanding the current drilling boundaries if it meant winning approval for more fuel efficient cars developing alternative energy sources and making the country more energy independent
972873 this notion that somehow i was playing the race card is ridiculous
972874 what i said in front of a 98 conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
972875 i dont come out of central casting when it comes to what presidential candidates typically look like
972876 it doesnt just have to do with race it has to do with my name it has to do with my biography and my background it has to do with our message of change
972877 in no ways do i think the mccain campaign has targeted race issues although i will say the way they have amplified this is has been troublesome and the eagerness in which theyve done it they think they can exploit this politically in fact what i have said and theres no doubt about this is that they want me to appear risky to the american people and i dont think that there is any doubt that people are still trying to figure out whats this young guy doing here running for president
972878 our job is to make sure that the changes were promoting is the changes that have to be made if we dont make them in fact thats the riskier course
972879 i think his comments were clearly were clearly the race card because of what he said everybody can read his remarks and in fact his campaign retracted those remarks so i think its very clear and i was very disappointed i was very disappointed at his comments so his campaign retracted those remarks so lets move on
972880 it was a communication to our supporters and it was kind of a bookend to a week that we thought was very successful and it was the intention to use a little bit of humor
972881 as the underdog campaign sometimes our crowds arent 200 000 strong and roaring but that its just a different approach and style and imagery and were holding our own were very pleased with the way things are going and where we are
972882 how does he like the mccain camp mocking him as the one
972883 the one as mccain aides sardonically call obama glided through afghanistan iraq and jordan girding his messianic loins for the inevitable kvetching he would face in israel as skeptical jews try to get a better sense of whats in obamas kishkes
972884 i dont know that people in missouri are going to like seeing tens of thousands of europeans screaming for the one a mccain aide snarked to the politico
972885 i dont look like the president on a dollar bill or a five dollar bill
972886 john mccain and george w bush are going to try to scare you about the way i look and that i dont look like other presidents
972887 you know he doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
972888 personally id like to do another doom movie i thought working with it was a blast there are some lessons we learned the best way to do things better is to get the experience

972902 this is a genuinely new concept in information security consultancy
972903 company leaders have for too long not been addressing information security because of the expense and difficulty attached to ordering and managing their training and consultancy needs having to engage consultants for weeks or months or attend long drawn out training events is not the best way forward for perhaps the majority of companies the small business needs maximum flexibility and cost efficiency and the global player needs to be able to access these resources remotely
972904 this liveonline service in contrast does not require expensive travel plans or consultants it is an ideal highly flexible do it yourself approach to understanding and meeting your organisations particular needs

972920 i told everybody that knows me that its just a matter of time its going to come this was a six week run and i was geared up to win im glad that it happened the first week out
972921 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
972922 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
972923 i said just cozy it down there if it goes in fine dont leave yourself a 4 footer and i left myself a 4 footer
972924 ive been practicing 4 and 5 footers all week last week and at the end of the day it pays off
972925 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
972926 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
972927 i tried to hit it as close as possible so i didnt leave myself any putts
972928 i feel like the luckiest guy in the world right now
972929 i went to an n sync concert with my sister
972930 and there was already a line all the way around the block
972931 but the offspring playing a free show at chain reaction doesnt get any better or smaller than that
972932 it happens you gotta expect it to happen if you get hurt its part of life its a learning experience and its fun

972934 vi meget glade for at ola lindgren og staffan olsson har accepteret at st i spidsen for sveriges herrelandshold
972935 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
972936 now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million 1 million pounds in contributions
972937 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
972938 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
972939 also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
972940 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed date it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
972941 john mccain looks forward to debating barack obama as often as possible but its disappointing that sen obama has refused his offer to do joint town hall meetings
972942 for many of our mountain commuters it is the only form of transportation that these people have
972943 everything that we do is being undermined by the fuel crisis
972944 you would put a lot of people out of work if you took their bus away from them
972945 nowhere near the bottom and the resulting market turmoil isnt showing signs of abating
972946 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors donated to his campaign
972947 its a complete waste of the countrys time and attention when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
972948 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
972949 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us
972950 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that
972951 there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the sourth i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about
972952 if the good lord had intended us to walk he wouldnt have invented roller skates
972953 what are you doing here son of man come here my poor thing
972954 my poor little safi just as pure as your name the sins of man have nipped at your flesh but youre still a righteous man
972955 are you going to kill me like you did mr drake
972956 i only kill bad men and youre not a bad man you came here by another mans song only the righteous can hear me when i hunt
972957 careful child of man that pleases me i want to please you im going to take you out of your struggles everything that was once his is now yours understand me
972958 sienna escaped to the virgin islands to be with her daddy her real daddy after
972959 he was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling and she finally agreed to let him back in the house in his mind he has definitely dropped sienna but hes in a very confused state at the moment his biggest fear is losing his kids
972960 i cant comment when im ready ill issue a statement its because of the children
972961 russia expresses deep concern due to another turn of tension around south ossetia illegal actions of georgia for building up its military presence in the region constructing fortification without any control
972962 russia has called on tbilisi to follow the line of responsibility and counts on constructive influence of washington
972963 its the second time you come to moscow since the beginning of the summer previously you discussed the situation in georgia what about now
972964 yes i really discussed the georgian matter with general yevgeny buzhinsky in the head of the international department with the ministry kommersant and with first deputy foreign minister alexander denissov
972965 is the situation so grave that you have to meet with russias military
972966 why not the abkhaz question embraces aspects referring to the diplomatic and the defense spheres for example russias base in gudaut the problem of the peace keepers in the conflict zone can be referred to this point too
972967 to us the most important thing now is making georgia and abkhazia launch direct talks the format doesnt play any role they can be held in the framework of group of friends which would be most preferable to us the usa is the groups member along with russia but if the parties want to talk separately in some other place its perfect
972968 brilliant st petersburg sochi novosibirsk we dont care we only wish they would talk if the parties consider that they want to negotiate without the u s collaboration good if they want our assistance perfect we have a clear cut task settle the dispute so that it complied with the national interests of the usa and what national interests do we have in abkhazia hardly any there are no rich oligarchs in the usa buying up abkhaz beaches we do not want to turn abkhazia into a source of sand and gravel for sochis olympic facilities we have no business interest there our only interest is the absence of war in the region so that georgia could be stable
972969 and what about pipelines crossing georgia like the baku tbilisi ceyhan one
972970 of course we have such kind of interests in southern caucasus
972971 but to this end youll have to eliminate concrete obstacles for example resolve the matter of georgias military units being deployed in the upper kodori
972972 first of all we want talks without any preliminary conditions we hope that at the first stage the parties will conclude a cease fire agreement not only moscow wants it rather its sukhumis desire the abkhaz are afraid that georgia can attack them
972973 i dont know whether they do or not but the fear is real the abkhaz must get four sets of security guarantees from the georgians first of all that there is no military conflict possible second economic security wed like abkhazia to interact economically with georgia turkey the countries and other states of the black sea region there must be guarantees of cultural and political security when georgian refugees return to abkhazia in large groups the political and cultural rights of the abkhaz minority may be challenged so the georgian party must take account of their protection when drafting the peace plan as to the kodori gorge the abkhaz party must offer something in exchange for a withdrawal of the georgian police officers it all must be included in the deal the parties have started to discuss they just need to sit down at the negotiations table
972974 the georgian party was ready to launch them as i visited tbilisi at the end of july the georgian government was ready to set off for berlin where negotiations would have started in sukhumi i tried to persuade president sergey bagapsh and foreign office chief sergey shamba to go to berlin but they insisted on meeting their preliminary demands
972975 russias diplomats also made it the point that the meeting was too early
972976 i cant give commentary whether there were any undercover agreements i can only point out that coincidentally the two parties simultaneously refused to come to berlin perhaps it was not pure chance i dont know
972977 in may the counterparts began direct talks irakli alasania georgias ambassador to the united nations visited sukhumi you paid a visit to abkhazia a day before whereas moscow didnt seem to mind it what happened
972978 i cant explain it myself i had very constructive negotiations after they were over sergey shamba said that the abkhaz party was ready to launch direct talks and it felt even more confident with the american delegation present it was a perfect start a few weeks later georgia claimed in the un that it cancelled the flights of its unmanned flying jets over the territory of abkhazia more to the point it asked russia to consult with tbilisi in case it carried out any activities in abkhazia it also pledged to withdraw its commandos and heavy artillery from the region and on the next day moscow deployed its railroad construction troops in abkhazia
972979 shortly after that you visited moscow at the beginning of july how did it react to the u s active collaboration
972980 quite normally since were part of the negotiation process in the framework of the un group of friends for georgia its a fact
972981 did the russian diplomats raise the question of georgias admission to
972982 you can always feel it in the air when it comes to georgia our position is clear georgia has met all the map requirements but it is not the same as membership in the alliance georgia will have to work its way to get nato admission
972983 should the issue of georgias admission to nato be included in the cluster of agreements about the abkhaz settlement you said on several occasions that russia is another party in the conflict in georgia and every party has their interests
972984 the usa objects to such a link georgia wants to join the alliance and we support its determination its not because we want to hurt russia we know that moscow is concerned over the security of its southern borders its been the case since the times of ivan the terrible and we dont want to fuel the fears once again
972985 nevertheless american experts have suggested undertaking harsh measures towards russia in connection with the situation over georgia you can recollect a recent report of david phillips expert with the atlantic council who suggested boycotting the sochi olympics and introducing air patrolling of abkhazia by nato forces
972986 the situation hasnt been that serious to talk about the usa boycotting the olympics in sochi but if war starts in abkhazia which lies a few kilometers away from krasnaya polyana it wont contribute to the olympics for sure
972987 no similar weapon in the service of armies in the world
972988 i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is
972989 used strong language to condemn recent russian actions at home and abroad ranging from threats of economic sanctions against former soviet satellites to the harassment of independent firms
972990 i see a steady progression in russia of more and more repression of rights and the disappearance of semblances of democracy
972991 we have to deal with them russians negotiate with them especially in light of their hoard of petrodollars but we cant sit by and watch a country murder people in england

973005 ive come to moscow with this human rights agenda because as i suggested it is our belief that this is a moment of hope
973006 quieter feet dont be bouncing forward in the pocket into traffic as he did at times last year the theory is if he stays back he might have another split second before the pass rush gets to him
973007 every offseason i go into it thinking what can i do to get better
973008 this year i looked at my games last season and saw on my seven step drops i was setting up bouncing around looking at my options 1 2 3 4 and moving up in the pocket
973009 ive moved way up see i better throw it now or the pockets gonna collapse on me
973010 what i was doing was creating pressure where there should be none when i watched film i wanted to change that
973011 and as i watched film of other quarterbacks i noticed one
973012 bradys like back back back stay look stay look boom complete thats what i want to be doing
973013 probably every year for the last 10 years ive looked at my game and tried to get better in the offseason romo said
973014 theres a reason i was able to get to this level and win this job and i think that has a lot to do with it
973015 there are times in a game you have to say to guys hey this is too important for us to be making the mistakes youre making way too important and that was one of those times
973016 i dont read much of the gossipy stuff and i dont care about it he said
973017 i take my job very seriously but its hard to take that stuff seriously in five or six years nobodys going to remember any of it
973018 bill said that before the days when phones could be used as cameras
973019 weve had some pretty big regular season games in the last couple of years a couple years ago when
973020 you mean playing perfect in a playoff game and winning is not winning a big game the way i look at this job is if youre waiting for everyone to get on your side and think youre great youll be miserable your whole career
973021 i am so sick of that favre story my exhaustive research indicates that i have spent 62 3 percent of my first three post vacation weeks on
973022 i think we trained really well all week and sorted out a few disruptions
973023 i knew the tries would come if we were able to get over the advantage line and obviously there were a few factors our set pieces were good defensively we were letting ourselves down in a couple of areas but i am really pleased for the team
973024 they put a lot of pressure on themselves to get a result a lot of the leaders stood up big time weve just got to get over this one and look forward to next week
973025 there were some signs that we were getting the go forward ball that we needed so it was just a case of wearing them down once we put the ball behind them and got their pack moving their legs ran out quickly which was always the plan
973026 if the players get a few things right there is no reason why they cant be successful in this competition and i think we showed that against griquas
973027 if the players believe in themselves and put the team first in their preparations who knows what can happen
973028 it was nice to see us stick to some structure and you cant have that without go forward which obviously riaan swanepoel and jean deysel and some of the other forwards provided
973029 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
973030 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
973031 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
973032 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
973033 constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life

973035 the rally didnt go as i expected unfortunately and i didnt achieve what i wanted which was a podium
973036 i feel quite empty it ended for me on friday morning and that was all due to an error i made on the recce when i didnt mark a rock in my pace notes
973037 at least i got my confidence rhythm and speed back and drove the new stages which is good for future efforts it was difficult to be motivated but the best medicine after an accident is to get back behind the wheel i know the speed is there so i hope that next year ill have the chance to fight for a win here
973038 they should have acquitted me because of course i didnt swear at anybody
973039 five days isnt bad i thought id get 10 or even 15 the officer who arrested me was in court but he didnt even look at me even when the judge asked him to maybe he felt ashamed
973040 its not against the law to carry a flag what is wrong with wanting to be part of europe
973041 my daughter is very well brought up and those cops lied about her swearing to get her into trouble what a disgrace for our police
973042 most of our police dont want to fight crime or take on the bandits they prefer to spend their time repressing young people and stopping them from going on demonstrations
973043 most belarussians think of russia as a kind older brother who will always help us
973044 but russia is an enemy that wants to swallow us and take away belarus independence
973045 but someone has to do something if not us then who the absolute majority is unhappy but most people just complain in their kitchens they are afraid to act
973046 but its terrible for belarus this country has lost some of the brightest most creative young people who knows how many will come back
973047 you can leave the country for three months come back and find that nothing has changed and for me that is awful
973048 i dont want to spend all my life in a regime of total fear of total control of unpredictable arrests when a policeman can stop you and beat you for no reason
973049 i think one day people here will understand that this system is finished
973050 i am sure that this day will come and the army will join the peoples side and they will join us it will not happen tomorrow but we should prepare for it

973062 i am so desperately sad that craig died from the injuries he sustained at brands hatch yesterday
973063 he was a really super young guy and only on the saturday evening was i chatting to him in the paddock with him telling me about his wsb ambitions for 2009
973064 craig was so determined and professional would always say hello and enthusiastically keep me in touch with his progress
973065 britain has lost a wonderful rider whom i admired enormously and had every chance of being a future world champion
973066 it is fitting that the abiding memory so many of us will have of craig was him riding brilliantly battling for the lead of an incredible race in front of his home crowd
973067 it seems barely believable that such a freak accident claimed his life and i extend my deepest sympathies to his family and friends
973068 it is with great sadness that we learned craig passed away in the early hours
973069 the teams thoughts are with craigs family and friends at this very difficult time his family pass on their thanks to all well wishers

973084 these fluorinated compounds known as pfos are highly persistent both in humans and in the environment more so even than ddt they last for years and may have serious health and ecological consequences
973085 we have established they are toxic to various soil organisms including worms and once in water there is a risk they may enter the food chain it is suspected that they may be linked to cancer
973086 although the fire fighting foams which use pfos are being gradually phased out they are still in widespread use and sites where they have been used or spilled remain contaminated for many years

973131 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
973132 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
973133 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
973134 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign

973147 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains

973162 i just have one worry i talked to a lot of students at gdc who cited a steering behavior neural nets etc as proof of their ai expertise but im concerned this might point to a case of academic over fitting those things are well and good but theyre also relatively straightforward in and of themselves and very specific if i had to choose between someone with experience with those particular tools of the trade and someone else with a generally stronger math and cs background i would always choose the latter of course no one says you cant have both and im sure thats what the game schools are aiming for
973163 i left retro studios a few weeks ago and ive been talking to a lot of developers in the meantime its been a really fun process

973168 interviewer name a cool technique that was used in a game you like or that you think could be used with good results in a game interviewee well a cool use of x was would be in y interviewer that sounds interesting tell me in as much detail as you can about x and why you think it worked would work well
973169 these are questions a seasoned ai developer should be able to answer
973170 if the ai in games today is to get better do we need to use the more advanced techniques
973171 if the more advanced techniques are so critical why is it so difficult to find people who are actually using them
973172 if game development schools were to teach enough to cover pauls
973173 since a majority of what we do as ai designers programmers is crafting specific solutions to unique game specific problems is it necessarily right to ask some of the questions that paul proposes
973174 if most game companies tend to have very small ai staffs many only have a single person and
973175 hey wait hold on a sec so there are solutions for all these problems and i dont have to script everything maybe its time for us to put more of an emphasis on ai if we want to stay a world class aaa game studio
973176 and i dont want to spoil the opportunity for them to be used for the
973177 if i were in the position of hiring ai developers im speaking theoretically of couse im actually on the other end of the table a lot these days i would argue that the game specific solutions should be crafted on top of the foundation of existing industry knowledge
973178 i believe that as an industry were going to have to standardize our techniques and design patterns for game ai more than we have in the past if we want to advance
973179 theory rarely precedes practice but is rather a collection of observations on what has been come before and subsequently accepted as successful
973180 id just like to point out that there is nothing automatic about a cs grad that makes him her more capable than a games grad frankly when i was taking cs it was probably 20 useful and the rest was completely out of date rubbish
973181 for the most part ive just been teaching myself stuff the degree is mostly about credentials
973182 i used millington in the class i taught this spring and i was quite happy with it we have some philosophical differences but it is the most complete and robust introductory book on game ai ive seen to date i used matt bucklands book previously which was also quite good but not as thorough in its coverage

973185 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
973186 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
973187 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
973188 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
973189 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now

973191 sometimes you just dont have anybody to go especially during the day

973194 imagine you had all the top people in game ai together in one room
973195 about it as well also over the past few months there has been an extensive thread on the unlimited procedural animation
973196 real time motion retargeting to highly varied user created morphologies
973197 a type of computer animation used to automatically generate animation in real time to allow for a more diverse series of actions than could otherwise be created using predefined animations
973198 a type of computer animation used to automatically generate animation in real time to allow for animating relatively simple actions from a more diverse pool of potential actors whose potential construction renders predefined animations completely useless
973199 i want the a i to be able to send reinforcements to allied bases that are under attack from allied bases that have extra forces the a i isnt capable of that yet but implementing inter base roads helps pave the way for that feature pun intended
973200 human gaming skills have forced artificial intelligence to update the ante showing us the deep understanding required to play the simplest seeming of games while computers can now play at grand master level in chess and poker no algorithm can yet match a middle rank go player we just need to be sure we dont fall into the trap of fermis paradox playing games instead of exploring the universe

973205 i tried it with my wife who i normally has to be dragged kicking and screaming to sit in front of a video game and also roped in our four year old son who likes monsters both were hooked in seconds the deceptive simplicity of the interface masks cunning artificial intelligence that takes whatever you create and animates it with humour and style for example theres something very beautiful about the way the animations of the spinal column work you feel like a pilates instructor or an alexander teacher when you watch how pulling on one bone in the spine realigns the creatures posture i cant think of a more engaging anatomy lesson for a small child
973206 during this process i found that minesweeper will sometimes assist you and move bombs away from where you are clicking on
973207 sure i knew that coming in but i put some assumptions behind us about what it would mean to make a game unlike a civ game im not looking for the ai to wipe you out or to win in fact theres a lot of things that the ai just doesnt do that it could do
973208 whoa what happened my city got nuked i didnt even see that
973209 im surprised its taken this long to write an ai that can pwn the poker table in fact i suspect there are older implementations running on dedicated servers hosted in the turks and caicos islands that can give polaris a beatdown that will leave marks for years still its nice to know that the news is going out now playing a game of poker intermediated by a telecommunication system is one of the dumbest things a human can do these days
973210 there are two really big changes in polaris over last year
973211 first of all our poker model is much expanded over last year its much harder for humans to exploit weaknesses and secondly we have added an element of learning where polaris identifies which common poker stratagy a human is using and switches its own strategy to counter this complicated the human players ability to compare notes since polaris chose a different strategy to use against each of the humans it played

973227 hey cool we can just integrate a scripting language and all our design problems are over
973228 the reality is that most designers cant and shouldnt script to save their lives and those who can dont necessarily have the experience
973229 the reality is that most designers cant and shouldnt script to save their lives
973230 1 invest in on the fly script creation and modification technology restarting the game is a timesink for the designer just like the compile link cycle is to the programmer
973231 in praetorians the ai programmer and the designers did a fair amount of this of course it helped lot that the ai programmer was sergio and that the main designer scripter was a former ai programmer himself ideal eh however another scripter was an absolutely non technical guy he hadnt even used a pc before joining the team but he was able to pick up the basics of programming and apply the patterns that sergio had burned in the scripts and explained to him
973232 infinity ward has more than a dozen designers who can work at that level and they can often implement major new features with little or no help from the engineers
973233 in praetorians the ai programmer and the designers did a fair amount of this of course it helped lot that the ai programmer was sergio and that the main designer scripter was a former ai programmer himself ideal eh however another scripter was an absolutely non technical guy he hadnt even used a pc before joining the team but he was able to pick up the basics of programming and apply the patterns that sergio had burned in the scripts and explained to him
973234 those efforts are on the right track but there is still a long way to go it s up to us to let them express their creativity in an easier way
973235 theres also unreal engines kismet serving the same purpose and in my opinion doing it a level of magnitude better
973236 im programmer not designer so perhaps im biased but every screenshot from
973237 maybe ill propose it as a project for my students
973238 i interviewed with infinity ward last week the thing that struck me more than anything was how many technically competent designers were on the team and how well they could use infinity wards rather advanced scripting system so apparently thats the key to outselling halo hire highly skilled and technically competent designers
973239 so apparently thats the key to outselling halo hire highly skilled and technically competent designers
973240 wrt hiring hasnt iw retained most of their key staff getting from moh aa to cod4
973241 off topic i know but i think the key here is to create a more compelling game
973242 thats true a really long way those named tools are really visual programming tools since they express programming concepts and programmers ways of thinking about things the problem is its almost only us programmers thinking this way giving designers a tool to code stuff with arrows and boxes doesnt change the fact that for them its an artificial way of looking at things

973244 you would think that they spent a lot of time designing just the right salsa making sure that every nuance of the flavor sensation that they wanted to express and then turned to the chip dudes and said
973245 they may even decide that the salsa should be crafted specifically to highlight particular taste features of the chip heck how thick should they make the salsa based on the surface characteristics said corn based masterpiece what changes if you design the delivery mechanism first and then design what is normal the focal point to match how different does the experience become note im going to eject from my metaphor before it breaks down completely im also getting hungry at this point it may be a bit obscure as to where im headed with this unless you are exceedingly clever and read the title of this weeks column however there is a thread floating around in the game designs that showcase ai

973256 how do you protect legitimate personal expression while preventing inappropriate sometimes harmful behavior larry king was admittedly a problematical test case he was a troubled child who flaunted his sexuality and wielded it like a weapon it was often his first line of defense but his story sheds light on the difficulty of defining the limits of tolerance
973257 for many teachers and parents the issue isnt whether king was gay or straight his father still isnt convinced his son was gay but whether he was allowed to push the boundaries so far that he put himself and others in danger theyre not blaming king for his own death as if anything could justify his murder but their attitude toward his assailant is not unsympathetic

973299 sensing political resistance in the face of what were then perceived as sky high gas prices the omalley administration in 2007 did not seek an increase in the state gasoline tax which has remained level since the early 1990s even as the price of fuel has more than tripled

973308 there is no evidence that combining alcohol with nude erotic dancing causes dancers to be uninsured that any dancer is in fact uninsured or that any uninsured dancer could qualify for assistance

973312 combating the negative secondary effects of the adult entertainment industry
973313 adult businesses such as nude and semi nude entertainment facilities have not been identified as crime hotspots
973314 research would suggest that alcohol serving establishments hotels and restaurants associated with nightlife activities would most likely be crime hotspots
973315 no support for the prediction from social learning theory that rates of rape would be positively associated with the prevalence of businesses offering nude or semi nude entertainment the prevalence of nonsexual adult businesses is more powerfully associated with rates of crime than the prevalence of nude and semi nude businesses
973316 when you start making nonexistent correlations as an excuse to pass taxes where will it end id be crucified if i were to say hey lets tax priests to fund pedophile programs because some priests have abused children its the same premise with strip clubs and sexual assault

973318 also negatively impact and deplete attendant jobs such as liquor distributors dry cleaners nanny services spas supply companies cleaning crews
973319 its a trickle effect infringe on the adult entertainment job market and you close up an approximately 240 million revenue generating machine in your state
973320 the reason that legislatures are introducing adult entertainment taxes is because most states are broke and in dire need of revenue streams to fund programs

973660 declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work
973661 the cantarell oilfield in the shallow waters of the campeche bay is regarded in the mexican oil industry as the countrys crown jewel it is the worlds second largest oil field by production pumping about 2 2 million barrels of oil as much as every oil field in kuwait put together for that reason the news from petroleos mexicanos the state oil company that the fields production would begin to decline this year was met with dismay declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work

973706 through this blessed jihad in yunnan this time the turkestan islamic party warns china one more time our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed we warn china and the international community for the last time that those spectators athletes particularly the muslims who are planning to attend the olympics please change your intention from going to china please do not stand together with the faithless people the turkistan islamic party volunteers will conduct violent military actions against individuals departments venues and activities that are related to the olympics in china

973712 thats not to say the students are more socially responsible themselves but it is to say emphatically that todays college students would prefer to purchase from companies that are socially responsible
973713 the findings correlate to the brands that are doing well in terms of actual bottom line sales with this audience so it feels fairly accurate at least in terms of buying behavior
973714 nike is perceived by many college students as a really positive community contributor
973715 it is seen as an innovator and innovation is adjacent to social responsibility for some its also seen as a strong supporter of urban communities

973753 it is a unique problem they have four individual associations and one olympic association
973754 for us its not important if the players are all from england
973755 there is another problem there because the four british associations have to put in one team which would be called great britain
973756 the first olympic games after the second world war were organised in london there was a british football team there therefore in 2012 therell be a british team
973757 it is not only a question of solidarity it is also a question of respect to the olympic spirit to let the young players have the experience
973758 we need the leagues and the clubs but we need players even if the ruling is negative for the players they should stay here they should play here
973759 in the future i think it is necessary we have an exact and precise ruling
973760 it has been decided for 2012 to avoid any misunderstandings and problems plus or not plus three overage players that the whole item of the presence of football in the olympic games shall be discussed immediately after the conclusion of the 2008 olympic games together with the ioc
973761 adopting clear and practical policies with regard to africa it will be our aim to assist any country to find solution to its problem
973762 in the whole sphere of external relations the government attaches greatest importance to our african policy
973763 the historic contributions of nigeria to regional peace missions in liberia and sierra leone which cost the country the whoping sum us 10 billion not to mention the gallant men and women of the nigerian armed forces who paid the supreme sacrifice in the cause of peace are hardly acknowledged by the international community
973764 nigerias foreign policy today extends however far beyond our concern for the wellbeing of our continent africa
973765 the debt burden for instance is not an exclusively african predicament many countries in asia the caribbean and south america are facing similar problems it is imperative therefore that these regions harmonise their efforts in the search for a fairer deal from industrialised nations of the west and this requires of us a more global approach to world affairs than was previously the case
973766 the centerpiece of any countrys foreign policy ought to be that country itself if it seriously considers itself a rational actor on the world stage every single action shall be adjudged by how much it advances our national power and influence and how much it advances our interests objectives and purposes
973767 our false generosity abroad and penury at home are proof that we are pretending to be what we are not because in reality we have been overstretching ourselves
973768 at that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands
973769 i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion
973770 for consider your calling brethren that there were not many wise according to the flesh not many mighty not many noble but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong and the base things of the world and the despised god has chosen the things that are not so that he may nullify the things that are so that no man may boast before god
973771 many o lord my god are the wonders which you have done and your thoughts toward us there is none to compare with you if i would declare and speak of them they would be too numerous to count

973801 substantially impair the branchs ability to perform its constitutional functions
973802 the seven additional cuts is on top of the nine positions we lost last year
973803 this is based on caseload but the likelihood of this happening is slim to none
973804 we dont like it but thats just the way the math works
973805 its ironic that at a time when our business is booming our revenue is being cut
973806 we have had every agency in the executive and legislative branches searching for solutions and im not seeing that in the judiciary
973807 there is no other agency that im aware of that has had the luxury and the opportunity to hide behind the constitution to protect the status quo
973808 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
973809 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
973810 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
973811 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
973812 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now
973813 every time i hear the pager go off you know you wonder whos gonna be there and whos not
973814 sometimes you just dont have anybody to go especially during the day
973815 i hate to admit it but theres been more times this year where other departments have had to help us out
973816 we pat them on the back as hard as we can
973817 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
973818 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
973819 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
973820 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
973821 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
973822 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
973823 this is an effort to amend the constitution by ambush
973824 this is not the proper way to deal with our founding document
973825 reverses legal precedent prohibiting public funding of private school alternatives
973826 we thought they were both policy issues that had to do with education spending
973827 uniform efficient safe secure and high quality system of free public schools
973828 spoken loud and clearly about the value of free public education in the state
973829 the words we used were carefully considered and selected to create a system that the legislators knew if adopted by the people that it free public schools was the highest duty
973830 this amendment 9 could potentially damage our public education system in dramatic ways we barely have enough money for it now
973831 all i want is for our education system to be adaptable to each child
973832 this ensures the legislature can make new programs that meet every childs need
973833 circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
973834 my appreciation of the numbers was quite hopeless given my age and my level of experience in the city i wouldnt have thought that i would be so out of touch with reality
973835 it sounds an awful thing to say but i know people i went to school with and ive no idea how they survive on the incomes they have
973836 the goose that lays the golden egg is the people who come to london to make wealth
973837 a reflection of the success of policies here making the city one of the pre eminent financial centres of the world
973838 i dont think we should sit here and say london should be guilty for being successful
973839 its a fact of modern life that there is disparity and is it fair or unfair is not a valid question its just the way it is and you have to get on with it people say its unfair when they dont do anything to change their circumstances
973840 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
973841 if you aspire to anything beyond that youre not going to live there any more and thats the choice you make
973842 some of these are vocational things like nurses its accepted they go into it knowing that thats part of the deal
973843 many people like teachers dont do things for the pay but you wont find a teacher that works as hard as we do
973844 i do enjoy the fact i can have nice holidays and dont think twice about buying particular items
973845 im sick of this because with 100 000 in manchester you are well off 100 000 is a not a wealthy person down here
973846 we now live in a separate economy we live on a separate level to the vast majority of people in the country we dont send our kids to the same schools we have more choice over schools we have more choice over health we have more choice over where we live we have more choice over where we go on holiday and what we do for our jobs and we live in a completely different world to the people we live next door to
973847 i work hard ive got two boys and i want to provide for them
973848 i really object because what it does is take the whole emphasis and focus away into something thats totally irrelevant and wont help a poor person at all
973849 all kinds of bullshit crap which doesnt help the people
973850 people dont starve in this country its ok compared with other countries here you dont go hungry because you can just go and get money for free
973851 say 3 000 a month in their hands and theyre somewhere miles up north theyre not going to earn that sort of money so wheres the incentive for them to go out to work
973852 single people get pregnant and get a flat and more money you just see everybody pushing prams then theyll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life
973853 doesnt get that much less money than another 18 year old working in a shop
973854 this thing of giving pregnant women 200 for dietary supplements like as if theyll really spend it on fruit
973855 we dont think just chucking money at the welfare state is the answer
973856 lack of ability is the main basis on which you get a job
973857 nobody in the public sector is actually trained to do the job that theyre required to do
973858 labour did a bit of that with extra taxes and windfall taxes and the famous raid on pensions the big debate is about how effectively all that money raising has been applied most people would say not all of it was well applied
973859 i have absolutely no idea how my taxes are spent and therefore i do not trust the system at all
973860 the classic is how much you pay in your taxation versus whats invested in the roads and the transport system it goes into a black hole
973861 little accountability and measurability in the way that tax is actually used
973862 say all we need to say about the waste and futility of public spending
973863 i want to talk about what charity can do for us
973864 what do you do now youve got all the toys
973865 youve already got all the houses yachts cars and jets you can use so what comes next is charity
973866 i get invited to places id never have seen otherwise
973867 if we can apply the entrepreneurial principles we have brought to business to charity we have a shot at having a really strong impact to be able to transform the lives of children
973868 the general feeling is a lot of cynicism about whether or not if you do give the cash its going to get where you want it to go
973869 people like us dont put our hands in our pockets so much

973883 hoje as institui es se preocupam em estar antenadas j perceberam que pesquisas alinhadas ao mercado s o aquelas que trazem algum benef cio para a sociedade e deixaram de ter apenas o foco do retorno imediato do curto prazo para pensarem no longo prazo na perenidade o mercado olha para a institui o como sendo de menor risco quando pratica a governan a corporativa

973930 said ivanka savic of the karolinska institute in stockholm who led the new research published online last week by the proceedings of the national academy of sciences
973931 this ancient structure is involved in orienting our attention to biologically important stimuli in our environment such as attractive partners

973933 these are all biological markers that something must have gone on early in development
973934 you get a sort of global shift in gender traits in gay people and straight people that affects not only their sexual orientation but other things as well

974115 yo me vine solo a polonia y no hablaba mucho ingl s s lo sab a decir algunas palabras como saludar y pedir algunas cosas entonces menos iba a saber polaco entonces cuando llegu siempre andaba con una persona que me acompa aba me llevaba al hotel bamos al entrenamiento pero con el tiempo me las tuve que arreglar solo y ah empezaron los problemas
974116 por ejemplo cuando fue semana santa yo no me acord de la fecha y ve a que estaban todos los locales cerrados por lo que no pude comer nada y pas el d a a puros chocolates otro chascarro que me sucedi fue cuando me citaron a uno de mis primeros partidos y yo no sab a que colocaban una lista con los convocados as que yo no me d por enterado y me fui para mi hotel luego supe que el t cnico me andaba buscando como loco donde el equipo estaba concentrado ya que cre a que me hab a perdido y yo sin saber estaba durmiendo en otro lado
974117 con el f tbol chileno hay una gran diferencia ya que ac se juega mucho m s r pido hay poco juego colectivo ya que la idea es llegar al arco rival con la menor cantidad de toques posibles siempre la pelota se disputa como si fuera la ltima del partido o si fuera una final de campeonato los entrenamientos tambi n son distintos ya que s lo hacemos una hora y 10 minutos diarios pero son de un ritmo intenso
974118 lo que sucede es que en el campeonato anterior mi equipo qued pen ltimo y se tuvo que jugar un repechaje y a ra z de eso sali a la luz que algunos equipos ten an problemas de corrupci n y arreglo de partidos por lo que comentan en la prensa el tema principal es que muchos equipos saltaron de tercera a primera divisi n en muy poco tiempo y eso fue extra o para todos entonces la federaci n empez a investigar y a una semana del inicio del torneo dijeron que ste no part a hasta tener resuelto el problema por lo que nos han dicho es que esta semana deber an dar la decisi n final para el inicio del torneo mientras nos hemos dedicado a jugar partidos amistosos
974119 tras la mala campa a del torneo pasado el equipo se reforz buscando superar lo vivido
974120 yo nac en uni n espa ola y sal del club con ganas de experimentar algo nuevo se me dio la posibilidad de ir a ublense y me sali la opci n de salir al extranjero y lo aprovech ya que ten a una cl usula de salida mi intenci n ac es jugar alcanzar una regularidad y esperar que este nuevo torneo sea mucho mejor en lo personal como en lo grupal
974121 pese a que no estoy en un equipo de renombre la experiencia es buena ya que a diferencia de chile ac uno juega a estadios llenos y siempre andan veedores viendo los partidos as que si sale algo feliz me voy a otro lado eso s que ese pa s debe tener un nivel futbol stico mayor
974122 yo nunca me he cerrado a la posibilidad de vestir alguna vez la camiseta de la selecci n si marcelo bielsa ve los videos de los futbolistas que militan en europa y llegara a ver los m os y se interesa yo encantado yo tengo descendencia palestina y me han llamado de all para que vaya a jugar por su selecci n pero no quiero eso ya que si pongo en la balanza sin duda me tira m s la camiseta de la selecci n chilena
974123 me enter de lo que pas por los diarios jorge garc s es el t cnico y l decidir lo que es mejor para el equipo qued asombrado con lo que pas con manuel neira mauricio rojas rodrigo p rez y nicol s canales ya que eran pr cticamente todos titulares y ahora pasan a estar separados del plantel no tengo mayores detalles de lo que pas pero al final las decisiones finales son del t cnico con la dirigencia
974124 quand on se sent bien dans un v tement tout peut arriver un bon v tement cest un passeport pour le bonheur
974125 obviamente me doli mucho no haber clasificado a beijing porque era la tenimesista que ten a la ultima opci n aunque despu s entend que fue por mi lesi n complicada en el hombro
974126 he pensado dejar mi carrera en los odesur 2010 ah me gustar a retirarme por la lesi n que me ha tenido a o y medio aguantando el dolor quiz s me den de nuevo ganas para jugar la clasificaci n a londres
974127 creo que se da una sola vez en la vida ser medallista en unos juegos ol mpicos ellos ya tuvieron su momento su oportunidad y que lo repitan yo creo que es muy dif cil lo de atenas fue hist rico pero en estos momentos hay tenistas que est n mucho mejor que ellos
974128 nicol s mass est pasando por una situaci n especial no est en su mejor momento como estuvo en esa poca y va a ser dif cil repetir eso con gonz lez en el dobles igual pueden pelear
974129 uno entiende que ellos viven situaciones complicadas respecto a un profesional esa cr tica va en relaci n al sistema a c mo se maneja nuestra sociedad al respecto hay una falta de cultura deportiva en nuestro pa s que no permite tener los recursos para ellos
974130 el hecho de haber participado ya era un sue o m s a n cuando uno ve lejana la posibilidad en el caso personal es donde menos diferencias se marcan a ese nivel de edad disfrut mucho haber sido parte de esa selecci n ol mpica me llena de orgullo por los compa eros y por el logro obtenido
974131 la experiencia es nica s per especial no se parece a ninguna otra por el hecho de que es multideportiva no es ni como un mundial o panamericano
974132 hay que ser realistas la mayor a de los pa ses que logran medallas invierten miles de d lares por cada una de ellas estamos hablando de cifras sumamente altas que estamos a a os luz de invertir en chile porque ac no hay cultura ni pol ticas deportivas por algo chile es uno de los pa ses que hacen menos deporte en latinoam rica
974133 honestamente en el caso del tenis ellos son los que est n mas cerca tienen un tour anual se codean con los n mero uno y los top ten entonces no se van a encontrar con algo distinto no como otros deportes que es super dif cil en las olimp adas se va repitiendo la t nica pero la mayor a va a hacer un trabajo personal y estas son cosas que van de acuerdo con la inversi n que se hace

974146 the spirit lives an evening with the works of will eisner

974148 you can find him online at yes of course this address as i browse through the pages seem interesting we will see whats the result after all the reading
974149 what makes fogbugz better than other bug and issue tracking systems is its simplicity
974150 it is obviously fitting that the spirit be the title sponsor for the eisners
974151 and the fact that frank and will were such good friends makes it even more special
974152 lionsgate couldnt be more thrilled about the opportunity to sponsor the eisners
974153 it would make perfect sense that the most influential awards event in the comic book industry should be sponsored by the most anticipated film at comic con but add to that the fact that the spirit is an adaptation of will eisners seminal comic written for the screen and directed by his friend fellow comics visionary and comic con legend frank miller and its almost too perfect

974159 i often wonder how kishore kumar who innovated so much in his time would have would have innovated today in bollywood film music
974160 although film music has undergone a vast change over the years i am sure kishoreda would have fitted in the current music trend and sprung surprises
974161 a singer like kishore kumar never gets outdated perhaps he would have been ahead of our time also
974162 one can only copy him none can innovate like him
974163 they struggled in the film industry together my dad was trying to become a director and kishore uncles aim was to get into films that was how they came to know each other and became friends
974164 he kishore kumar was fine tuned with panchamda r d burman in fact both understood each other so well that they could extract the best out of each other he treated panchamda as his younger brother
974165 i remember when dad planned his movies kishore uncle would tell panchamda to send the music tracks of the films to him at least 24 hours in advance for rehearsal before recording
974166 tunes of some of the songs he sang might not have been good but the quality of his voice was so sweet that the songs sounded good to ears above all he was a very good human being eccentric sometimes but jovial all the time
974167 kishore was my darling i knew him through ashok kumar who gave me the my first big break in bombay talkies
974168 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time

974177 ices strong second quarter performance demonstrates our teams continued focus on growth and execution
974178 while producing organic growth in our core businesses we worked toward the implementation of several long term growth initiatives scheduled to take effect during the third quarter we have spent the last year preparing for both the transition of our energy clearing to ice clear europe and the commencement of exclusive trading of u s russell index futures at ice futures u s we also expect to complete our acquisition of creditex later this quarter and are already collaborating with the creditex team on innovative initiatives to serve the global credit default swap markets we continue to invest in new avenues of growth and to evaluate m amp a opportunities to expand our position as one of the most global diversified derivatives markets in the world
974179 the fundamentals of our business remain solid particularly given the increased need for risk management across futures and otc markets
974180 weve continued to grow our business substantially while generating synergies in our u s futures business and producing operating margins that reflect our disciplined approach to growth this consistently strong performance provides us with the balance sheet and cash flows necessary to execute the share repurchase program recently authorized by our board of directors even as we continue to invest for future growth this program reflects our belief that the current share price does not appropriately reflect the strong underlying fundamentals of our global business in compliance with sec rules we will begin the repurchase of shares after the creditex acquisition closes
974181 the arrangement will put pressure on the companys profit margins and dilute earnings for the next year and a half

974280 this encyclopedia not surprisingly is dedicated to darwin but not to the darwin you might expect the author would like to dedicate this volume to emma wedgewood darwin wife of charles darwin who remained charles darwins supporting and loving commpanion throughout his life of illness and hard work even though she believed that he was wrong about evolution and about religion without emma darwins help charles darwin would almost certainly have failed to complete his most famous works of course some other scientist would evetually have discovered the evidence and mechanism of evolution indeed alfred russel wallace figured it out independently of charles darwin some other scientists who championed evolution such as ernat haeckel and herbert spencer proclaimed a violent and oppresive version of evolution in contrast to the darwinian version of evolution that allows for the evolution of altuism it is possible that evolution would have been an ugly and oppressive theory if it had been presented to the world as spencerism or haeckelism instead evolution is darwinism and we have emma darwin to thank for it

974282 the key to this kind of altruism may be whether or not another animal is observing it the altruist can obtain greater social stature by being altruistic toward individuals that are unrelated and cannot repay mathematicians karl sigmund and martin nowak have produced calculations that demonstrate this advantage human donations of time and or money to charities says geoffrey miller more closely resemble a display of wealth than a caculated plot to get reciprocal benefits altruism like conspicuous consumption may constitute a message to the population at large conspicuous charity proclaims i am rich enough to give away some of my resourses this tells you that i am not only rich but also that i am a good person conspicuous consumption tells the observers only the first of those two things the reputation of being a good person might yield enough social benifits to compensate for the cost of the altruism

974317 we price in us dollars and i dont have to tell you about whats happened in the last few years
974318 the cost of doing business outside the us has dramatically changed its reasonably likely well have some sort of price hike the pressure has built in the last few years
974319 we dont see pricing as a way of weathering the downturn
974320 last year services revenue was eight percent of total revenue and i think were pretty low when it comes to our peers we can help by having a larger capability we can probably get that to eight to 12 percent of revenue
974321 it is very difficult to tell what microsoft is talking about when they talk about numbers of seats or costs because they shove so much into their environment but i do know we have been engaging against them and winning

974325 the difficult news this morning is that we thought we were getting a patch but we havent gotten anything
974326 essentially were at the same place as we were yesterday before apple released the patch
974327 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
974328 this update addresses the issue by implementing source port randomisation to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks

974330 is apple modifying the bind distributions from isc and somehow didnt realize this repercussion or is there some kind of configuration file that they forgot to change it must be one of those two
974331 one of the projects that the young ba needs to produce is an extract report layout that is to be sent to a mainframe for storage in an archiving repository
974332 use fixed length lines with the fields in fixed width columns using a fixed width font like courier
974333 its difficult to explain to the young ba that the whole report must use the same size font throughout and even the spaces between the columns must be a fixed number of spaces and that all that hard work with a gui editor could have been done so much quicker with notepad
974334 the notion that we could just waltz in and inject democracy into an extremely complicated devout and ancient culture smacked still smacks of neo colonialist legerdemain

974356 one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
974357 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
974358 this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
974359 i was terrified he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
974360 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people

974363 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
974364 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
974365 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it

974372 a lot of the stuff i do is pretty basic
974373 its the type of stuff that a lot of people try to do but maybe its that im doing them all rather than just one or two
974374 i think one of the reasons i entered the contest was because it would be a great way to learn about what other people are doing and to raise awareness about being green
974375 its been a little bit overwhelming because its not like i do it for a certain purpose
974376 its just part of my life so its a little weird but its good as well because the more people that know about this stuff can do the same sort of thing and get involved in their communities
974377 this car paid back its design and development costs many years ago allowing it to now be sold at a lower cost than a more recently developed car
974378 it usually takes a few years for revenue from sales to repay the development costs of a new car
974379 in developing markets the availability of ed cars is much lower creating the market opportunity for low cost new cars
974380 the u s has a ready supply of cheap cars but they are ed cars not small low powered and poorly equipped new cars
974381 the market five years ago was much smaller than it is today but there are still buyers with between us 5 000 and us 10 000 to spend on a car
974382 that demand is being met by new small cars with small engines and limited equipment becae there isnt an alternative
974383 they were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer then a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer the kiss was more than just friends they seemed like something more going on

974390 there are these things called standards that the corps and other military and police groups are obligated to follow it is to avoid giving someone the wrong idea about who you are and your application in society i guess blackwater and the federal marijuana plant warriors dont care what people think
974391 what is most disturbing is the claim of several blackwater mercenaries we spoke with that they are here under contract from the federal government and the state of louisiana
974392 that raises a key question under what authority are blackwaters men operating a spokesperson for the homeland security department russ knocke told the washington post he knows of no federal plans to hire blackwater or other private security

974405 motorboats have been allowed for decades on most larger adirondacks lakes and adk believes that this traditional use should continue
974406 but there also should be more opportunities in the adirondacks for canoeing and kayaking in peace and quiet we believe this can be accomplished in ways that has little impact on other users

974410 by striking down the clean air interstate rule the us court of appeals has left all of the northeastern states vulnerable to acid rain and fine particles of smoke that damage peoples lungs
974411 cair was our only hope that significant reductions would be made over the next decade in the midwestern smokestack pollution that has killed our forests and fish tainted our drinking water and poisoned our food and wildlife with mercury
974412 cair was the single most effective environmental rule issued by the bush administration
974413 the clean air act amendments of 1990 werent enough to stop acid rain in the worst hit places in the nation we arent alone in our plight the entire east coast is suffering its time for the ecological damage and unhealthy air days to stop
974414 any of those options would be better than allowing acid rain and smog to continue unabated across the nation

974419 as the magnitude and rate of change increases we can expect that future forests especially in unique places like the adirondacks may be quite different

974424 the primary reason the adirondack mountain club was formed in 1922 was to create hiking trails the first project w g howard and his trails committee took on was the cutting of the northville placid trail by the end of 1923 the trail was essentially in operating order

974453 eu n o acredito que a rodada ainda tenha fracassado eu acho que houve dificuldades e na dificuldade foi melhor parar para repensar como continuar
974454 nessa semana vou estar na china e pretendo falar com o presidente chin s hu jintao e vou falar com o meu amigo o primeiro ministro da ndia manmohan singh para ver se a gente consegue retomar essas discuss es

974456 uma vergonha muito grande que os pa ses ricos subsidiem o seu produto para exportar e isso causa grandes danos competitividade
974457 o que n s queremos na verdade apenas uma rodada que permita que haja justi a na sua conclus o final n s vamos continuar insistindo todo mundo sabe que eu sou teimoso e portanto n s vamos conquistar isso apenas uma quest o de tempo aqueles que j ficaram vendendo derrotismo aqueles que j foram acender vela porque fracassou v o quebrar a cara porque n s vamos concluir o acordo da rodada doha pode demorar mais um m s mais dois meses mas n s vamos conseguir fazer isso

974460 esperan a que com movimentos pol ticos como esse que o presidente iniciou com o presidente dos eua george w bush e outras conversas eu tenho esperan a de que a gente possa apontar

974465 they believe that if pas leaders can hold some key ministerial posts in the umno led federal government it will be possible to initiate changes from within
974466 i write this open letter to sincerely apologise to all pas members and supporters denying that the party had met with umno again i apologise for my misdemeanour
974467 i admit i was wrong in choosing abdullah as my successor now i regret because i didnt think that mr clean would not be that clean
974468 i believe that umno members and leaders at all levels who are angry with me for anointing abdullah surely does not want to make the same mistake
974469 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
974470 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
974471 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
974472 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about

974476 the crop of young adults who eagerly boarded their flights to go continue their studies abroad
974477 to plunge in headfirst in independence is not as easy as it looks
974478 it is a unique problem they have four individual associations and one olympic association
974479 for us its not important if the players are all from england
974480 there is another problem there because the four british associations have to put in one team which would be called great britain
974481 the first olympic games after the second world war were organised in london there was a british football team there therefore in 2012 therell be a british team
974482 it is not only a question of solidarity it is also a question of respect to the olympic spirit to let the young players have the experience
974483 we need the leagues and the clubs but we need players even if the ruling is negative for the players they should stay here they should play here
974484 in the future i think it is necessary we have an exact and precise ruling
974485 it has been decided for 2012 to avoid any misunderstandings and problems plus or not plus three overage players that the whole item of the presence of football in the olympic games shall be discussed immediately after the conclusion of the 2008 olympic games together with the ioc
974486 you know youre right i do drink a bit too much from now on its 5 beers maximum and only at night and never by myself
974487 at the moment we do have three distinct projects underway within bungie some familiar some not some on a closer horizon some quite far off
974488 were excited to be working on our next project but its going to be quite a while before i can share any details on exactly what that project is
974489 so many new college hires these days are tech savvy
974490 they can easily install im applications at work and carry on conversations while looking like theyre working affecting productivity generic internet filtering services wont necessarily block these
974491 the numbers add up small businesses can lose hundreds of thousands of dollars while corporations can lose millions easily every year
974492 im locks blocking features are a simple effective way for instant message security and it has a number of similar features as internet filtering services
974493 if youre not excited about the future youre not paying attention
974494 hsbc has had communications with us on this issue and it has clearly told us that hsbc will not sell any shares of bocom and it will hold bocoms shares for the very long term
974495 top management of both hsbc and bocom are very much satisfied with the results of cooperation at the current stage particularly our co branded credit card business
974496 maybe it was an act of nature that well never understand
974497 i dont know of a single scientist of any reputation who takes his claims seriously
974498 i found that they really were producing a great deal of excess energy with hydrogen
974499 some people may disagree with the theory but the experiments work
974500 there are various offers of interest in the hsbc tower
974501 one of these could be the hsbc office but this is being analysed its all preliminary
974502 i cannot confirm whether the 10 percent the independent refers to is true or not
974503 yup im a strong atheist and am not ashamed of it
974504 we are not going to comment on whether there is a criminal investigation
974505 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
974506 i often wonder how kishore kumar who innovated so much in his time would have would have innovated today in bollywood film music
974507 although film music has undergone a vast change over the years i am sure kishoreda would have fitted in the current music trend and sprung surprises
974508 a singer like kishore kumar never gets outdated perhaps he would have been ahead of our time also
974509 one can only copy him none can innovate like him
974510 they struggled in the film industry together my dad was trying to become a director and kishore uncles aim was to get into films that was how they came to know each other and became friends
974511 he kishore kumar was fine tuned with panchamda r d burman in fact both understood each other so well that they could extract the best out of each other he treated panchamda as his younger brother
974512 i remember when dad planned his movies kishore uncle would tell panchamda to send the music tracks of the films to him at least 24 hours in advance for rehearsal before recording
974513 tunes of some of the songs he sang might not have been good but the quality of his voice was so sweet that the songs sounded good to ears above all he was a very good human being eccentric sometimes but jovial all the time
974514 kishore was my darling i knew him through ashok kumar who gave me the my first big break in bombay talkies
974515 he was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling and she finally agreed to let him back in the house
974516 in his mind he has definitely dropped sienna but hes in a very confused state at the moment his biggest fear is losing his kids
974517 three orphanages have been visited already and photographs have been sent to her
974518 never trust a computer you cant throw out a window
974519 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
974520 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
974521 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
974522 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
974523 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
974524 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
974525 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
974526 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
974527 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
974528 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
974529 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
974530 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
974531 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
974532 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
974533 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career

974539 the bad cheating is known for its dark secretive backroom ways and is practiced by the likes of real and alleged performance enhancing drug users it involves pills or needles
974540 the good cheating is more nuanced its the clever stuff the wink and the nod deception passed down from the 1951 new york giants to gaylord perry to joe niekro to well kenny rogers
974541 ik voel me goed en ben blij hier te zijn
974542 ik zal zeker van start gaan ik loop tot mijn benen het begeven
974543 daarna doe ik alles dat in mijn mogelijkheden ligt dat is precies waar het bij de olympische spelen om gaat

974546 de blokken zijn langer en hebben een andere hoek dan wij in europa gewend zijn iets dat de start alleen maar ten goede komt
974547 my cat casper is a very special cat because he survived a terrible fire in our home unfortunately five of our six cats died the fireman spent 20 mins trying to resuscitate casper and thankfully he saved him devastated he nearly didnt make it and was terribly ill for a long while but the fact that he survived helped us to focus and stay strong when we were devastated by the loss of our other cats and the devastation of our home through the fire kind cat with everything that casper has been through he has coped exceptionally well he may be a nervous cat he is a very kind and loving once he feels confidence in people happy life i was sooooo excited when casper was shortlisted for the rescue cat awards and very very proud he deserves recognition for everything hes been through he had had a hard life before we got him and it had obviously affected him badly he might be a bit nervous but hes learnt to trust us it would have been much harder to pick ourselves up after the fire without casper he has been such a positive focus for us and we are thrilled we have been able to give him a happy life superhero there were lots of other cat owners at the award ceremony who had their own stories about their amazing cats and how they had survived different problems casper didnt win but it was an amazing day to me casper is a superhero

974549 volgens de dokter is het een wonder dat er verder niets mis is met zijn knie

974552 this is the way it is when someone is dying it isnt the heart the kidneys any one thing anymore they pass in and out of lucidity and its very hard to tell you what to expect
974553 confusion growing darkness and the fear he might have been wrong
974554 for what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun
974555 i think the three of us should take some action where are my shoes
974556 what good are they lying there lets do something the day is starting
974557 shall we pretend its morning and were going to chapel
974558 if you were going to speak to the students in chapel today what would you tell them
974559 oh im not sure theyre going to want to hear that
974560 no unfortunately if we were there we could go to the museum like we used to do after breakfast

974567 neither would i probably so i guess we just have to wait
974568 das hat f r uns gemeinsam mit einem massiven ausbau des betreuungsangebots oberste priorit t
974569 die aktuelle situation in der kinderbetreuung ist desastr s alleine um die von der eu gesteckten ziele zu erreichen fehlen aktuell 80 000 pl tze in sterreich
974570 kinderg rten sind nicht nur betreuungseinrichtungen sondern vor allem bildungseinrichtungen zugang zu hochwertiger betreuung und bildung darf keine frage des einkommens bzw der herkunft sein um kindern chancengleichheit zu erm glichen muss mit einer wirksamen fr hf rderung aller kinder gestartet werden
974571 ich begr e alle ma nahmen die zur fr hzeitigen bildung unserer kinder beitragen und damit zu mehr chancengleichheit f hren daher ist mir auch der ausbau der kinderbetreuungspl tze f r unter dreij hrige so wichtig denn je eher kinder gef rdert werden um so mehr profitieren sie f r ihren weitern bildungsweg
974572 au erdem ist es diskriminierend von einer erh hung der familienbeihilfe nur f r kinder ab sechs jahren zu sprechen jedes kind ist uns gleich viel wert unabh ngig vom alter

974590 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
974591 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
974592 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
974593 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
974594 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
974595 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists
974596 und genau dieses wissen wird sich am wahltag bezahlt machen
974597 die n he der beh rde zu den gemeinden und der bev lkerung gelebt hat
974598 es n tzt nichts die h nde in den scho zu legen und zu sagen
974599 der rechnungshof schreibt dass eine pauschalk rzung der esf mitteln im raum steht oder dass sogar der ordnungsgem e abschluss der programmperiode 2000 2006 von der kommission verweigert werden k nnte anhand von erfahrungen aus anderen staaten w re dadurch mit einem verlust an eu mitteln in h he von bis zu 76 mio euro zu rechnen
974600 gerade die esf gelder die durch ihre zielsetzung f r ein soziales europa stehen m ssen f r die steigerung der besch ftigung dieser gruppen auch zur verf gung stehen und verdienen daher eine mindestens ebensogro e aufmerksamkeit wie investitionen in unternehmen und die wirtschaft nur wenn wir die sozialen errungenschaften europas mit der gleichen vehemenz vertreten wie die wirtschaftlichen wird es uns gelingen die menschen wieder von der eu zu berzeugen ich schlage daher vor dass sich die beteiligten ressorts bereits in den n chsten tagen zusammensetzen um zu beraten wie diese gelder f r den arbeitsmarkt gerettet werden k nnen denn schlie lich gibt es auch ein klares bereinkommen dass von den sterreich zustehenden eu mitteln kein euro in br ssel liegen bleiben soll so steht es im regierungsprogramm und das gilt f r mich auch weiterhin

974602 die gesch ftsf hrung hat uns mitgeteilt dass unter den derzeitigen bedingungen keinerlei versuche unternommen werden das unternehmen zu retten mit jahresende wird zugesperrt eine jahrelange diskussion ber umwelt standards findet ein grausames ende
974603 wir haben alles versucht und waren f r alle rechtlich gangbaren l sungsvorschl ge offen es sind verschiedene szenarien diskutiert worden als beh rde standen f r die stadt jedoch die einhaltung der gesetzlich festgeschriebenen grenzwerte au er frage nach dem heute auch einigkeit dar ber bestand dass ein ippc verfahren f r eine ab nderung der 1996 gemeinsam mit der fa glanzstoff festgelegten werte auf zeit unumg nglich gewesen w re kann dies nicht der knackpunkt gewesen sein die bekanntgabe der schlie ung des st p ltener standortes mit ende dezember war eine rein zeitliche und finanzielle entscheidung der unternehmensf hrung
974604 wir haben den betriebsratsvorsitzenden klar gemacht dass wir zu unserem wort stehen und alles in unserer kraft stehende unternehmen werden um die zukunft m glichst vieler mitarbeiterinnen abzusichern
974605 es sind bereits vermittlungsversuche an unternehmen in und um st p lten angelaufen die r ckmeldungen sind durchaus positiv
974606 wien wendet mit 300 millionen euro j hrlich den von allen bundesl ndern h chsten betrag zur sicherung der fr hf rderung von kindern in den kinderg rten auf die stadt weist wie auch heute wieder zwei unabh ngige tageszeitungen festgestellt haben in summe das qualitativ beste angebot auf bietet deshalb von allen bundesl ndern den h chsten grad an vereinbarkeit zwischen beruf und familie nur rund 30 prozent der eltern bezahlt f r den besuch der ganztages kinderg rten der stadt wien den vollen rund 40 prozent einen jeweils abgestuften erm igten beitrag und f r 30 prozent ist der kindergartenbesuch beitragsfrei mit dieser sozialen staffelung wird allem den finanziell schw cheren also jenen die dies brauchen sp rbar unter die arme gegriffen
974607 die leistungen wiens mit anderen bundesl ndern etwa mit nieder sterreich in negativer form zu vergleichen ist deshalb mehr als hinkend vor allem wenn man die zahl der ganztageskinderbesucher in wien mit jener in nieder sterreich vergleicht w hrend in wien anteilsm ig rund 70 prozent der kinder ganzt tig betreut werden sind es in allen anderen bundesl ndern im schnitt nur 45 in nieder sterreich gar nur 39 prozent kollegin cortolezis schlager vergleicht also immer pfel mit birnen
974608 erst m ssen die entscheidungsgrundlagen f r die zukunft der aua auf den tisch gelegt werden sonst ist jede diskussion sinnlos
974609 diese form der inkompetenten ffentlichen diskussion schadet der zukunft des unternehmens dr ckt den aktienkurs in den keller und sollte schleunigst beendet werden
974610 die gr nen verlangen von der regierung sie soll jene papiere auf den tisch legen auf deren basis ber totalprivatisierung oder sperrminorit t etc entschieden wird
974611 darunter sind brigens auch jene die bis vor kurzem das genaue gegenteil von dem behaupteten was sie jetzt sagen
974612 die gr nen haben bereits im fr hjahr darauf hingewiesen dass es ohne strategischen partner f r die aua nicht gehen wird jedenfalls aber dringend gehandelt werden muss da haben molterer sp und auch das iag aua management noch st ndig von einer anzustrebenden stand alone l sung geredet nun behauptet die sp wie vp gnadenlos das gegenteil
974613 eine solche strategie wie sie brigens in deutschland und anderen l ndern existiert wurde einfach nie erstellt daran hat auch verkehrsminister faymann seinen anteil
974614 das aktuelle projektierungsvolumen der vivacon ag allein liegt bereits bei rund 400 millionen euro wir sind daher sicher der apotheker und rztebank als gr tem genossenschaftlichem prim rkreditinstitut mit seiner anspruchsvollen kundenstruktur gemeinsam mit der licon gmbh dauerhaft die entsprechenden angebote liefern zu k nnen

974618 as the baby boomer generation retires and the demand for medical services increases the operational and administrative challenges of servicing this larger population of patients is expected to worsen this divide
974619 well i saw a guy a few months ago who was really really sick and he turned out to have amyloidosis
974620 i am just not comfortable with that we dont do that here
974621 they choose not to do that and their choice trumps hers period
974622 nothing about me if not by me after consultation with these so called experts
974623 work group that reserves to itself the authority to judge the quality of its own work
974624 say im a middle aged man nervous after hearing of tim russerts death and i want a cardiac ct to reassure me would you give it to me
974625 always giving patients what they request or feel that they want or need
974626 i want you to not kill me and to help me live longer thats it
974627 theres no new money coming into the system except of course for the 10 annual healthcare inflation
974628 the more horizontal you are the more patient like you are not every patient wants and needs to be a consumer
974629 is meaningful health care or any other kind of reform possible
974630 in a policy making environment that is so clearly and openly influenced by money
974631 congress will be able to achieve health care reforms that are in the public interest
974632 an average of about 832 000 for each senator and representative
974633 of course theres nothing new here for decades the health care industry has leveraged its money and influence shaping policy to its own ends
974634 there is broad expert consensus that one third to one half of all health care expenditure is waste
974635 talk privately with most health care professionals physicians hospital execs health plan administrators benefits managers supply chain execs and there is reasonable agreement
974636 such changes could drive tremendous savings for individual corporate and governmental purchasers
974637 but at significant cost to health care firms and professionals revenues and profitability would plummet
974638 what will it take for congress to mount serious public interest efforts that focus on serious issues
974639 as far as i can tell there are two and only two solutions here
974640 americas largest corporations the organizations that drive national policy through lobbying now to galvanize to preserve the common interest whats needed is a national business coalition that collaboratively focuses on whats good public policy for the country whats in our common short and long term interest this is tough
974641 it would require a new congress under new leadership to resolve to rid itself of its lobbying cancer and to do so in a way that is highly visible and publicized there would be ferocious opposition from industry hence the need for visible articulate leadership from key political and business leaders
974642 the most amazing turn of events i have seen in 20 years of following health care policy in washington dc
974643 if this event is not participated in b you guys then dont come to me later saying the work culture is not supportive of these kind of activities
974644 they kind of hold on to it much longer than people in other places might but if 2006 is any guide the independents will break very hard for the democrats

974649 if you dont like seeing elite rich kids ostentation lifestyles then dont give that to obama vote for mccain who calmly looks toward the light
974650 and now he made time to go to the gym but cancelled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras

974657 insbesondere die berufsgruppe der spengler ist stark gef hrdet da sie teilweise auf sehr sonnenexponierten pl tzen wie d chern und fassaden und mit stark reflektierenden materialien arbeitet
974658 bestimmte richtwerte wurden um mehr als das zehnfache berschritten das tragen von bekleidung und sonnenschutzmittel sowie die verwendung von uv schutzbrillen ist daher gerade f r spengler unabdingbar

974714 im pleased to be able to welcome lpr to the tour of britain and am sure that their inclusion will benefit the race as both petacchi and di luca are more than capable of winning stages and possibly the overall too
974715 like everyone else im also excited by the prospect of seeing alessandro petacchi going head to head with mark cavendish in the sprints which should make each days stage finish unmissable

974766 unlike the changeable regions of its envelope hiv needs at least one region that must remain constant to attach to cells if this region changes hiv cannot infect cells equally important hiv does not want this constant region to provoke the bodys defense system so hiv uses the same constant cellular attachment site to silence b lymphocytes the antibody producing cells the result is that the body is fooled into making abundant antibodies to the changeable regions of hiv but not to its cellular attachment site hivs cleverness is unmatched no other virus uses this trick to evade the bodys defenses

974804 obama had won his first campaign by using old fashioned chicago machine tactics at a time when the notion of machine politics was increasingly anachronistic
974805 big labor and big capital blue and white collars and minorities
974806 gradually chicago caught up with the rest of the country and media driven politics eclipsed machine driven politics
974807 it became increasingly difficult to get into homes and apartments to talk about candidates
974808 high rises were tough if not impossible to crack and other parts of the city had become too dangerous to walk around in for hours at a time and people didnt want to answer their doors thus the increasing dependence on tv radio direct mail phone banking robocalls et cetera all things that cost a hell of a lot more money than patronage workers who were themselves in decline anyway because of anti patronage court rulings

974852 choosing to ignor how poorly your chosen candidate in managing
974853 false and misleading statements in some of mccains latest negative ads
974854 obama is continuing to run nothing but a positive campaign
974855 paint the white house black and im sure thats got em terrified
974856 what they re saying is well we know we re not very good but you can t risk electing obama
974857 by attacking obamas alledged political ego you are choosing the tactic of attempting to tear down his recent stellar showing of competency and confidence on his trip and meetings with heads of state how dare he act like a president
974858 it wasn t until the last week however that the narrative of obama as a president in waiting
974859 perhaps one of the clearest indications emerged tuesday from the world of late night comedy when david letterman offered his top ten signs barack obama is overconfident the examples included obama proposing to change the name of oklahoma to oklobama and measuring his head for mount rushmore
974860 jon stewart teased that the presumptive democratic nominee traveled to israel to visit his birthplace at bethlehem s manger square new york times columnist maureen dowd amplified the mccain campaign s private nickname for obama the one

974862 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
974863 obama is continuing to run nothing but a positive campaign
974864 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital reads a statement from a former landstuhl surgeon col danny jazarevic and circulated by mccains camp
974865 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country
974866 cool heres the entire staement from the distinquished member of the military
974867 after speaking with gration the campaign decided to cancel the trip
974868 gibbss statement said the hospital visit which had been on the internal schedule for several weeks was canceled because obama decided it would be inappropriate to go there as part of a trip paid for by his campaign
974869 you said you would never an have disrespected a war hero
974870 i was going to be accompanied by one of my advisers a former military officer and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasnt on the senate staff
974871 obama is continuing to run nothing but a positive campaign
974872 the false and misleading statements in some of mccains latest negative ads
974873 please oh pretty please give me an example of a
974874 please oh pretty please give me an example of a false statement in an obama sic you said it not me campaign ad
974875 mike i really would like to see a false as by mccain really
974876 he doesnt look like all the other presidents on the dollar bills
974877 it is appropriate for any candidate to tell the voting public why they should not vote for the opponent but it seems the leftist media calls any criticism by a republican for a democrat to be
974878 its quite different to point out someone lack of accomplishments or even a lack of talent from suggesting that they are senile or demented
974879 he doesnt look like all the other presidents on the dollar bills
974880 so nobody really thinks that that bush or mccain had a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre gonna try to do is make you scared of me ya know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name he ya know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
974881 well ramjet apparently you are perfectly comfortable with mccain and his surrogates recent avalanche of negative distortions of obamas statements and positions that have even stooped to using celebrity airheads and rap artists in a never ending attempt to imply guilt by associations that dont exist
974882 on his presidential style visit to the western wall in jerusalem last week obama left a written prayer intercepted by an israeli newspaper asking god to

974905 but two days before the visit pentagon officials told the campaign that only mr
974906 mr obama was asked by reporters to explain the matter on saturday in london
974907 that triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political and the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns mr
974908 what we the obama campaign decided was that we not make a visit
974909 at the same time many cash strapped americans are increasingly frustrated by higher ticket prices baggage fees airport delays and canceled flights that they are simply forgoing vacations that require air travel and staying closer to home

974929 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
974930 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
974931 mommy will never ever tell me to go use the potty again
974932 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
974933 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
974934 going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
974935 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
974936 i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
974937 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black

974958 i will make it the law of the land when im president of the united states
974959 a poorly disguised attempt by the labor unions to swell their ranks at the expense of workers rights and employers john mccain strongly opposes the efforts of the labor unions to strip working americans of their right to a private ballot in deciding whether or not to organize as a union
974960 this is simply a debate over process but it is up to the workers and they should be free to choose their process
974961 if they wish to vote by secret ballot instead of a card check process they can the law does not strip them of that right
974962 will allow workers to form a union through majority sign up and card checks and strengthen penalties for those employers who are in violation
974963 take away the protection of a private ballot giving union organizers free rein to publicly pressure workers into signing cards stating support for a union this is un american
974964 multimillion dollar effort to galvanize small business owners workers community leaders and citizens to preserve the rights and freedoms of americans in the workplace

974972 ik wilde ja zeggen tegen charly op mijn blote voeten in de weelderige tuin van de brabantse boerderij van mijn moeder maar het weer kan in augustus nogal onbestendig zijn en ik zie het niet zitten om in een klamme tent ons feest te geven

974974 de beste vriend van mijn ouders die ik mijn peetoom noem is bisschop van een vrij religieuze gemeente zijn overtuiging staat voor respect voor mensen in de breedste zin van het woord het maakt niet uit wat je gelooft als je maar met eerbied omgaat met mensenrechten ik heb een eigen religieuze beleving ik geloof in het goede
974975 op een gegeven moment is het gewoon niet meer geloofwaardig
974976 ik hou het maar op het feit dat een aantal bladen hier in nederland in de komkommertijd zit
974977 manuela droeg altijd kleding van percy zodoende zijn we ooit een hele tijd geleden bevriend geraakt
974978 het is natuurlijk heel triest dat er dan zulke verhalen naar buiten komen
974979 mijn beste verhaallijn was de dubbelrol ik speelde janine maar ook sophia de ex vrouw van ludo iedereen dacht dat ze dood was sophia deed op een gegeven moment alsof ze janine was en ik speelde dus twee rollen op precies hetzelfde moment
974980 mijn slechtste acteerzoenen waren met fos en meneer harmsen die allebei verliefd waren op janine
974981 ik zou heel graag nog eens guusje nederhorst terug willen zien in de serie echt heel jamer dat dat niet meer kan
974982 ik vond de verhaallijn omtrent het plan om ludo te vermoorden geweldig dat bleef verrassend
974983 mijn beste acteerzoen was met inge schrama sjors en bing gingen trouwen in de efteling en de huwelijksnacht was heel romantisch
974984 ik zou angela schijf in de rol van kim nog wel eens terug willen zien ze was erg goed de sc ne waarin ze wegging toen haar moeder kanker had was ontzettend emotioneel
974985 toen barbara borstkanker kreeg heeft charlotte besijn dat zo goed neergezet dat er brieven binnenkwamen van vrouwen die het echt hadden gehad en die vonden dat ze de rol zo goed vertolkte het was een heftige verhaallijn maar ze heeft het echt heel goed gespeeld
974986 mijn beste acteerzoen was met everon jackson hooi we kunnen het ook heel goed met elkaar vinden sjors en bing zijn het beste setje van gtst dat vindt hij ook
974987 het zou grappig zijn om arnie alberts nog een keer terug te zien in de serie
974988 de leukste verhaallijn vond ik die van dokter simon die geheugenverlies en last van waanbeelden had het lijkt me een uitdaging om zon gestoorde rol te spelen
974989 met christophe heb ik mijn beste acteerkus gehad ik was nieuw in de serie en in n van mijn eerste sc nes moest ik al met zijn karakter nick zoenen christophe was gelukkig heel lief voor me ook mijn slechtste zoen was met hem ik had daarvoor haring gegeten
974990 het zou raar zijn om hem terug te halen maar ik vond robin altijd supergoed rop speelde de rol van de geestelijk gehandicapte robin zo geloofwaardig
974991 toen jack zijn oma augusta in een diepe put gooide dat was mijn beste actie in de serie
974992 mijn favoriete acteerkus was natuurlijk met lieke die steekt er met kop en schouders bovenuit
974993 ik zou reinout oerlemans als arnie alberts en het nichtje van meneer harmsen jessica nog wel eens terug willen zien in de serie
974994 de dood van lotje was heel heftig om op te nemen we liepen van half acht s ochtends tot half zeven s avonds buiten ik had al die tijd pumps aan en ik moest op het graf liggen ik voelde me pas weer beter nadat ik vier uur lang in bad had gezeten
974995 zon tien jaar geleden had laura een lesbische relatie met tessel dat was mijn beste acteerzoen we hebben er zelfs het nieuws mee gehaald
974996 ik ga quinty trustfull wel missen maar ze heeft het hartstikke druk en doet allemaal leuke dingen
974997 het is jammer want ik deed natuurlijk altijd house vision met quinty maar het belooft weer een mooi seizoen te worden ik heb er erg veel zin in
974998 ik doe het voor het derde jaar daarvoor deed ik het reisprogramma boarding now het is fantastisch om programmas over reizen te maken het wordt wel even doorpoten want het loopt allemaal door elkaar heen we beginnen in augustus met tv makelaar en dan in september 26 afleveringen van house vision erbij

975035 ik denk dat ze bij goede tijden slechte tijden een fout hebben gemaakt ze willen verjongen omdat de kijkcijfers teruglopen en vonden dat chris nog niet zo verankerd was in de serie en dus weggeschreven kan worden als je als schrijver een personage niet de kans geeft om te verankeren zal dat ook niet gebeuren lijkt mij bovendien dalen de kijkcijfers altijd in het voorjaar dus dat argument is onzin
975036 ik hou er gemengde gevoelens aan over ik heb zoveel goede vrienden gemaakt het is gewoon heel jammer als het aan mij lag zat ik er nog gewoon in

975090 mina ei ole n us sest kui tal nnestub need lapsed s nnitada siis oleksin mina ilmselt isa ja ma ei taha et naine kellest ma olen lahutatud saaks minu laste emaks
975091 sel juhul on kohtuotsus juba langetatud t eline ema kellele antakse laste hooldus igus on see kes eelistab anda lapsed pigem teisele naisele kui lasta nad tappa n nda m istis kohut saalomon kolm tuhat aastat tagasi
975092 ma r kisin kohtule et teadusele toetudes v ime elda et inimolend alustab oma eluteed kohe kui on toimunud viljastamine sest me teame et informatsioon elustab mateeria

975095 teil parlamendid pole igust peita rahva eest t de te peate tlema oma rahvale et inimolend saab alguse eostumise hetkest vastasel juhul ei saaks temast iialgi inimest vastasel juhul pole see

975097 mitte miski ega mitte keegi ei saa mitte mingil moel lubada s tu inimolendi tapmist olgu see feetus v i embr o laps v i t iskasvanu vanur v i ravimatu haige v i surija veelgi enam mitte kellelgi ei ole lubatud paluda tappa olgu ennast v i m nda teist isikut kes on usaldatud tema hoole alla ega saa ta anda oma n usolekut selleks ei eksplitsiitselt ega implitsiitselt samuti ei saa kski v imuorgan sellist tegu seaduslikult soovitada v i lubada

975099 inimene kes kaitseb oma elu ei ole s di m rvas isegi kui ta on sunnitud andma r ndajale surmava hoobi
975100 kui inimene kasutab enesekaitseks suuremat j udu kui h davajalik siis on see ebaseaduslik ent kui ta t rjub r nnaku m dukusega on tema enesekaitse seaduslik
975101 seaduslik kaitse v ib olla mitte ainult igus vaid ka range kohustus nende jaoks kes vastutavad teiste elu eest perekonna v i riigi hise h ve eest
975102 kui veretutest vahenditest piisab et kaitsta inimeste elu r ndaja eest ning et tagada avalik kord ja inimeste turvalisus peab avalik v im piirduma selliste vahenditega sest need vastavad paremini ldise h ve konkreetsetele tingimustele ning on rohkem koosk las inimisiku v rikusega
975103 karistuse iseloomu ja ulatust tuleb hoolikalt kaaluda ja nende le iglaselt otsustada ning see ei tohiks minna rmuseni s aluse hukkamiseni v lja arvatud absoluutse h davajaduse korral teisis nu juhul kui hiskonda ei ole v imalik teisiti kaitsta kuid t nap eval on sellised juhud karistuss steemi p siva paranemise tulemusena v ga harvad kui mitte praktiliselt olematud
975104 alates hetkest mil munarakk on viljastatud on alanud uus elu mis ei ole ei isa ega ema elu pigem on see uue inimolendi elu oma iseseisva kasvuga see elu ei saaks kunagi inimeluks kui see ei oleks juba inimese elu sellele p sivale tunnistusele annab kaasaegne geneetika v rtusliku kinnituse see on n idanud et esimesest hetkest peale on fikseerunud programm milline see elav olend saab olema inimene konkreetne iniviid inimene talle iseloomulike aspektidega mis on juba suuresti m ratletud viljastumise hetkest peale on alanud inimelu seiklus ning iga selle suurtest v imetest n uab aega et leida oma koht ja olla valmis toimima
975105 abort on inimolendi tahtlik ja otsene tapmine ksk ik mis vahenditega see ka toimub tema eksistentsi mis ulatub eostumisest surmani algfaasis
975106 otsene abort see t hendab kas eesm rgina v i vahendina sooritatud tahtlik abort on alati raske moraalne eksimus
975107 iga inimest tuleb alati vastu v tta kui jumala andi ja nnistust ometi selleks et olla t eliselt vastutustundlik s ndimata lapse suhtes peab elu edasiandmine olema abielu vili
975108 heteroloogiline kunstlik viljastamine on vastuolus abielu htsusega abikaasade v rikusega vanemliku kutsumusega ja lapse igusega olla eostatud ja maailma toodud abielus ja abielust
975109 eostumine on igusp rane kui see on abieluakti tulemus mis iseenesest on kohane laste saamiseks mille jaoks abielu on seatud oma loomu poolest ja mille kaudu abikaasad saavad heks lihaks ent moraalsest vaatepunktist kaotab elu edasiandmine talle omase t iuse kui seda ei soovita abieluakti viljana see t hendab abikaasade henduse spetsiifilise akti kaudu
975110 moraalselt oluline side abieluakti t henduste ja abielu h vede vahel ning samuti inimese hinge ja ihu htsus ja tema l htumise v rikus n uavad et inimese saamine toimuks abikaasadevahelisele armastusele omase abieluakti viljana

975112 kirik j b moraalsest seisukohast homoloogilise in vitro viljastamise vastu selline viljastamine on iseenesest lubamatu ja vastuolus inimese saamise ja abielu henduse v rikusega isegi kui tehakse k ik et v ltida inimembr o surma
975113 homoloogiline kunstlik seemendamine e kunstlik viljastamine in utero abielu sees ei ole vastuv etav v lja arvatud neil juhtudel mil tehnilised vahendid ei asenda abieluakti vaid on kergendavad ja abistavad seda nii et see akt saavutab oma loomuliku eesm rgi
975114 t eline ja otsene igus lapsele oleks vastuolus lapse v rikuse ja loomusega laps ei ole objekt millele kellelgi on igus ega saa teda k sitleda ka omandina pigem on laps and k rgeim and vatikani ii kirikukogu konstitutsioon gaudium et spes ja abielu k ige levam teenimatum and ning vanemate vastastikuse eneseandmise elav tunnistus seep rast on lapsel igus olla oma vanemate abielulise armastuse spetsiifilise akti vili ning samuti on tal igus olla tunnistatud isikuna eostumise hetkest alates
975115 kui s nnieelne diagnoosimine austab embr o ja f tuse elu ja terviklikkust ning on suunatud selle kui iniviidi kaitsmisele v i tervendamisele siis on vastus jaatav ent selline diagnoosimine rikub r ngalt moraaliseadust kui seda tehakse pidades silmas v imalust kutsuda esile abort s ltuvalt diagnoosi tulemusest
975116 nagu mistahes meditsiinilise toime puhul patsiendile tuleb pidada lubatuks protseduure inimembr o kallal mis austavad embr o elu ja terviklikkust ega too talle kaasa ebaproportsionaalseid riske vaid on suunatud tema ravimisele tervisliku olukorra parandamisele v i elluj mise tagamisele
975117 meditsiinimine uurimust peab hoiduma operatsioonidest elava embr oga kui puudub moraalne kindlus et ei s ndimata lapse ega tema ema elule ja terviklikkusele ei tekitata kahju ning tingimusel et vanemad on andnud vastavateks protseduurideks oma vaba ja informeeritud n usoleku
975118 kui embr o elab olgu ta eluv imeline v i mitte tuleb teda austada nii nagu iga inimest embr oga eksperimenteerimine kui see ei ole otseselt terapeutiline on lubamatu eksperimenteerimise puhul mis on selgelt terapeutiline nimelt kui on tegemist eksperimentaalsete ravivormidega mida kasutatakse embr o enese h veks viimses p des p sta tema elu ning teiste usaldusv rsete ravivormide puudumisel v ib p rdumine veel mitte t ielikult j releproovitud ravimite v i protseduuride poole olla lubatav

975201 real mental illness is boring depressives are toxic and dull
975202 i need a fucking intervention i need people who know what theyre doing to stand up and hand me a plan because really ive spent twelve of nineteen years not knowing what it was i was supposed to do and its gotten me exactly here
975203 god give us grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed courage to change the things that should be changed and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the other the first year of our recovery from manic depression is pretty much like our first year of sex education weve been shown all the diagrams we can name some of the parts but on friday night we still think the best way not to make babies is to pull out and hope we dont make a mess out of the doctors office and straight back into the same world of disappointment grief and guilt we were in earlier that day but now with a little hope and a prescription two weeks later the disease has us by the groin again and were crushed we thought we had a cure but here we are just as fucked as ever with this disease ever thinks life will get better and for just cause because without treatment it never will the only way to get better is to find a doctor and follow their instructions you have to fight back against this disease and recognize manic depression is something that actively works against you you getting into the office thats you accepting you have a problem and finding treatment happens when we finally get into recovery ive been coming across a lot of posts recently on a lot of blogs written by people who have been in treatment for a few months or even less and who see no hope because the manics are still there and worse so are the depressions theyre confused and the only solution some of them have is to find help by swallowing a lot of the wrong pills common none of us know whats supposed to happen in the first weeks and months of our recovery none of us understand that because manic depression is a disease with identifiable effects and symptoms we can learn from the people who went before us tiny piece of something in your brain little microscopic drips of chemicals that are just a little bit out of place or about four out of a trillion neurons sparking once instead of twice
975204 for too long weve deluded ourselves into believing manic depression was either something to be perversely proud of or something to be desperately ashamed of but the mystique is a lie its just a fucking disease
975205 soon after we first get into recovery when either nothing seems to happen or things just seem to get worse we blame ourselves we blame the medications we blame the doctors and or we blame the system were not fixable not treatable improvement in our first year of treatment is the same way id improve if you removed one of the four knives that have been pushed into my stomach but it is improvement
975206 with the medications we take theres generally an overlap so for a few weeks to a few months youll have all of the worst symptoms of the disease with all the crap side effects of the medications once the medications get to the proper level in your body however the side effects start to become less noticeable as your body gets used to them while at the same time they start having an effect on the symptoms and the disease
975207 manic depression has no weight there may be some depressing horrible tragic shit in your life story but manic depression didnt kill your dog md didnt divorce your parents md didnt kill your best friend in a drunk driving accident before you could apologize to him manic depression did however prevent you from rationally dealing with those problems
975208 manic depression is a thin coating its a thin sheet of reflective ice concealing an ocean it corrupts our ability to reason and without that ability we cant defend ourselves against the thoughts inside our heads so we find excuses we can live with people with our disease are excellent at rationalizing unreasonable behaviour to fit situations we cant understand
975209 people can live with manic depression the same way people can live with cancer but without treatment youre living at the whim of a tumour and it doesnt really know you you know the inner softer you so what the fuck does it care medication is the only way to prevent the delusion that people will understand through your death the pain you feel the medications are the only way to stop yourself from taking the knife and running it across your wrists
975210 i can feel the wave coming on i should just stay in bed and not move
975211 after youve taken the initiative to find help its you that has to take the initiative to get your family involved your family has watched the horrors of manic depression every time you cut yourself or were violent or they stood beside you while two nurses pumped your stomach they have the experience through watching and trying to survive your insanity but they dont know how to react to your recovery other than to say well he aint crazy anymore
975212 its incredible of what this disease can convince you not only will it take away any community capable of protecting you it then convinces you this is your fault then it makes you proud to have it and prohibits you from seeking treatment then and this is sick then it kills you by convincing you everything it has done to you has been your fault
975213 the safety issues were interrelated and the study was quite complex due to constraints imposed by the vessel itself

975221 as the republican presidential candidate steps up his search for a running mate
975222 cantor 45 the chief deputy minority whip in the house has been mentioned among several republicans as a possible running mate for mccain a republican familiar with the conversations between cantor and the mccain campaign said cantor has been asked to turn over documents but did not know specifically what records were sought

975224 backed away from rival john mccains challenge for a series of joint appearances agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall
975225 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign

975288 agriculture accounts for 80 90 of all freshwater used by humans
975289 farmers in many countries are now faced with legislative restrictions on use of water
975290 has set a target of a reduction of 20 in water use in agriculture by the year 2020
975291 if food security for the region is not to be threatened this must be achieved without a loss in production
975292 elevated co2 plants maintained a higher daily net assimilation rate throughout most of the growing season
975293 at moderate and more severe levels of water stress co2 enrichment appeared to encourage shifting of assimilate into tubers as opposed to additional vegetative growth
975294 total biomass yield and water use efficiency increased under elevated co2 with the largest percent increases occurring at irrigations that induced the most water stress
975295 water use efficiency was nearly doubled under enriched co2 when expressed on a tuber fresh weight basis
975296 the results indicate that increases in potato gas exchange dry matter production and yield with elevated co2 are consistent at various levels of water stress as compared with ambient co2
975297 there has been little net global warming over the past 70 years
975298 the dan2400 is a flexible soc platform for wimax base stations and relays it provides the most comprehensive baseband soc solution available to equipment vendors offering a single development platform for any type of wimax infrastructure product the dan 2400 renders a single chip mac and smart phy implementation with embedded support for up to six antenna paths
975299 combined with analog devices rf transceivers a single dan2400 provides a range of ultra compact design options spanning from cost effective indoor femto and pico cells to powerful outdoor micro base stations all of which support integrated zero cost backhaul capabilities
975300 as the wireless industry has moved to more advanced modulation schemes such as ofdma in fourth generation systems like wimax analog devices has adapted its core rf mixed signal and systems ic technology to enable customers and partners to develop small high performance products with aggressive price targets
975301 analog devices applications engineering team worked with designart networks to optimize the performance of its ad9354 and ad9355 rf to baseband wimax transceivers together with designarts dan2400 soc platform as these common solutions are deployed adi will provide local support to joint customers
975302 in a market sensitive to power consumption and design cycle time we know that software tools are critical to the success of the project for simple low power designs or sophisticated processor based system on chip solutions the new libero ide 8 4 dramatically simplifies the design process with easy to use tools that identify and reduce sources of power consumption within a design remove tedious design tasks like writing new hdl code for logic functions and make connections between the myriad functions on the fpga or externally
975303 fujitsu advanced technologies ltd is pleased to see that easic is delivering a 45nm product
975304 this new asic is able to deliver the right combination of performance power and price combined with low up front cost we find the power reduction especially important as we look to add more functionality to our world class ict infrastructure products
975305 gartner has tracked asic design starts for years and the trend has been unmistakable downward to the right
975306 leading edge asic design costs have risen to the point where many small to medium sized companies have no choice but to use fpgas new approaches are being developed that lower asic design costs and have the potential to bring the benefits of asics back to the masses
975307 judging from the magnetic draw we are seeing from the market we are confident that fpga designers asic designers and semiconductor companies will find nextreme 2 to be an irresistible platform for their new designs
975308 the new asic era of high performance low power and dramatic cost reduction with fast time to market is just beginning and we are already driving a reversal in the trend of declining design starts

975312 understandably he and his family are extremely upset by the news and in particular the delay in treatment which could have implications on his long term prognosis
975313 to add further insult to injury there seems to be no urgency on the part of the trust to offer immediate treatment for these patients who through no fault of their own have had their diagnoses delayed
975314 my client has had to fight to get an urgent mri scan and even now some four months after the original failings came to light he is still awaiting urgent oncology treatment
975315 the care and wellbeing of patients is of utmost importance to our trust

975322 the product is fundamentally the software that can be packaged either in our own hardware or a customers own hardware
975323 a gigabit ethernet card for a cisco router costs 5 000 a gagabit ethernet card for vyatta costs 50 and you can buy it at frys or call the geek squad thats a huge difference in the economics
975324 they both perform the same way in some ways the open solutions perform better the same or better performance for one quarter the cost
975325 we have many customers who are tier ii and tier iii hosting providers
975326 were getting a lot of interest from people with cloud environments they can use it in ways they cant use a physical unit
975327 vyatta is software it all becomes about things like virtualization and the ability to reconfigure to reprovision the fact youve got network infrastructure thats fungible is really interesting to folks who build out large scale
975328 the whole point was that most spending is originally an electronic transaction why should paper enter the chain
975329 zoli tell that to accountants courts tsa if everyone accepted electronic docs we would be along way towards paper less the irony is we print paper receipts then scan when it should be electronic and on an exception basis print paper
975330 hotels are fond of taking my email address why the hell cant they use it for something productive email me the freakin pdf receipt instead of sliding it under the door
975331 nokia should be lauded for its step in the right direction
975332 it should also be noted that nokia has its feet firmly planted in both the linux and symbian camps as members of the linux foundation the limo foundation and creators of the n series mobile linux device
975333 symbian foundation software will be released under a royalty free license for foundation members as open source within two years with the intent to use the eclipse public license
975334 our commitment remains to s60 on symbian os and ultimately the symbian foundation platform as our platform for converged mobile devices or smartphones as symbian refers to them however we alre already producing mobile devices based on maemo linux our internet tablet devices we continue to see a strong role for linux in that class of devices and will continue development
975335 with regard to limo there are several different fora and consortia producing specifications and various technical and other documents to support development of mobile technologies nokia is constantly evaluating opportunities and is actively participating in some of those fora such as the open mobile alliance and open mobile terminal platform alliance limo is certainly an interesting forum and we will consider in good time what kind of role nokia should seek to have in this forum if any

975353 it is truly an unfortunate circumstance when a citizen of the united states is denied the fundamental right to vote whether residing in one of the several states or residing overseas
975354 it is even more unfortunate when a vote cast by a member of the armed forces serving abroad is rejected for no legitimate or compelling reason
975355 it is unfortunate that florida will accept an overseas absentee ballot with an unsworn handwritten date yet questions the oath under penalty of perjury of many of its service men and women

975408 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous john mccain celebrity ad i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when million of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
975409 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
975410 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
975411 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
975412 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
975413 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
975414 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
975415 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
975416 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
975417 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
975418 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season

975420 we realize that we cant study to be rabbis in the modern world without knowing something about science so wed like to ask you some questions
975421 in the talmud it says youre not supposed to make fire on a saturday so our question is can we use electrical things on saturdays
975422 yes the boys here cant push the buttons on saturday so i have to do it for them you see im not jewish so its all right for me to push the buttons i stand near the elevator and they tell me what floor and i push the button for them
975423 is the jewish viewpoint a viewpoint that any man can have because if it is not then its certainly not something that is truly valuable for humanity yak yak yak
975424 is it ethical for a man to hire another man to do something which is unethical for him to do would you hire a man to rob for you for instance
975425 electricity is not fire its not a chemical process as fire is
975426 of course theres electricity in amongst the atoms in a fire
975427 and in every other phenomenon that occurs in the world
975428 if thats whats bothering you you can put a condensor across the switch so the electricity will go on and off without any spark whatsoever anywhere
975429 if i could get that from him i could use it

975431 you need to learn this or someone will kill you
975432 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special

975441 it sounds an awful thing to say but i know people i went to school with and ive no idea how they survive on the incomes they have
975442 the goose that lays the golden egg is the people who come to london to make wealth
975443 a reflection of the success of policies here making the city one of the pre eminent financial centres of the world
975444 i dont think we should sit here and say london should be guilty for being successful
975445 its a fact of modern life that there is disparity and is it fair or unfair is not a valid question its just the way it is and you have to get on with it people say its unfair when they dont do anything to change their circumstances
975446 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
975447 if you aspire to anything beyond that youre not going to live there any more and thats the choice you make
975448 some of these are vocational things like nurses its accepted they go into it knowing that thats part of the deal
975449 many people like teachers dont do things for the pay but you wont find a teacher that works as hard as we do
975450 i do enjoy the fact i can have nice holidays and dont think twice about buying particular items
975451 im sick of this because with 100 000 in manchester you are well off 100 000 is a not a wealthy person down here
975452 we now live in a separate economy we live on a separate level to the vast majority of people in the country we dont send our kids to the same schools we have more choice over schools we have more choice over health we have more choice over where we live we have more choice over where we go on holiday and what we do for our jobs and we live in a completely different world to the people we live next door to
975453 i work hard ive got two boys and i want to provide for them
975454 i really object because what it does is take the whole emphasis and focus away into something thats totally irrelevant and wont help a poor person at all
975455 all kinds of bullshit crap which doesnt help the people
975456 people dont starve in this country its ok compared with other countries here you dont go hungry because you can just go and get money for free
975457 say 3 000 a month in their hands and theyre somewhere miles up north theyre not going to earn that sort of money so wheres the incentive for them to go out to work
975458 single people get pregnant and get a flat and more money you just see everybody pushing prams then theyll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life
975459 doesnt get that much less money than another 18 year old working in a shop
975460 this thing of giving pregnant women 200 for dietary supplements like as if theyll really spend it on fruit
975461 we dont think just chucking money at the welfare state is the answer
975462 lack of ability is the main basis on which you get a job
975463 nobody in the public sector is actually trained to do the job that theyre required to do
975464 labour did a bit of that with extra taxes and windfall taxes and the famous raid on pensions the big debate is about how effectively all that money raising has been applied most people would say not all of it was well applied
975465 i have absolutely no idea how my taxes are spent and therefore i do not trust the system at all
975466 the classic is how much you pay in your taxation versus whats invested in the roads and the transport system it goes into a black hole
975467 little accountability and measurability in the way that tax is actually used
975468 say all we need to say about the waste and futility of public spending
975469 i want to talk about what charity can do for us
975470 what do you do now youve got all the toys
975471 youve already got all the houses yachts cars and jets you can use so what comes next is charity
975472 i get invited to places id never have seen otherwise
975473 if we can apply the entrepreneurial principles we have brought to business to charity we have a shot at having a really strong impact to be able to transform the lives of children
975474 the general feeling is a lot of cynicism about whether or not if you do give the cash its going to get where you want it to go

975674 we got a decent start and the guys got out there i didnt want to let them get in a rhythm so i pushed past as quick as i could and wanted to set my pace we made a couple changes this morning and i realized i had a bike that was capable of going a little bit quicker than yesterday so i wanted to get out there and get the most out of it while i could i opened up a gap and was able to hold on at the end
975675 we got a better start than yesterday and got into the lead off the back straightaway
975676 i just tried to go as quick as i could and then mat came by and i got in behind him i was riding as hard as i could and i wasnt losing huge but a tenth a lap two tenths a lap i kind of made a small mistake and then i just tried to run a more comfortable pace i just didnt have those two or three tenths a lap thats pretty much it
975677 well i got a great start that was pretty much the highlight of my race i practiced probably 40 or so starts when we came here to test and its definitely paid off so weve got one thing in our bag were able to get up front and put some sort of battle in
975678 today we made a few changes in the rear of the bike and i dont want to say that they were in the wrong direction i just dont think they were perfect but i dont think it was any worse than yesterday pretty much i was lonely out there i was basically racing the fourth place guy behind me making sure i kept my splits on him

975697 the most wonderful of all things in life i believe is the discovery of another human being with whom ones relationship has a growing depth beauty and joy as the years increase this inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it it is a sort of divine accident and the most wonderful of all things in life

975769 there is a need for high quality clinical trials looking at treatments for sleep apnea that are large enough and long enough to find out whether we can prevent disease or reduce mortality risk
975770 obstructive sleep apnea is a deadly disease and it is now time for public health and medical practitioners as well as the general public to take it seriously
975771 the health profession needs to look closely at ways of detecting sleep apnea in children adolescents and young adults to prevent sleep apnea in the over 40 years age group

976177 non ho bisogno di essere come lui che vuole vincere per essere sicuro di quello che fa
976178 ha la mentalit di uno che non ha bisogno di successi
976179 contraccolpi emotivi dopo questo k o non credo proprio la penso allopposto di mourinho non ho bisogno di vincere per essere sicuro di quello che faccio a me va bene prendere uno schiaffo lo scorso anno ne abbiamo presi tanti e abbiamo reagito
976180 sono in italia per lavorare non per fare una guerra di parole
976181 in difesa avremmo bisogno di beckenbauer visto che non avr a disposizione materazzi chivu samuel cordoba e probabilmente ancora rivas non ci sono dubbi sul fatto che il bayern monaco sia uno dei migliori club al mondo ricordo che quando ero bambino mio padre mi port allo stadio da luz di lisbona a vedere benfica bayern non dimenticher mai di aver visto dei giocatori incredibili in campo franz beckenbauer gerd muller sepp maier e paul breitner era veramente un gruppo super
976182 il bayern monaco ha gi disputato la supercoppa di germania ed pronto per iniziare la bundesliga loro sono gi pronti noi non ancora ci alleniamo da pochi giorni e per questo mi aspetto una gara difficile ma non voglio essere campione nelle gare amichevoli voglio che sia pi difficile ora in modo che possa essere pi facile dopo
976183 e stato un periodo di adattamento alla squadra e dei giocatori al mio modo di lavorare stiamo lavorando per essere pronti per le prime gare ufficiali non per vincere tutte le amichevoli estive purtroppo ci sono quattro grandi giocatori infortunati e mi riferisco a samuel cordoba chivu lo stesso ibrahimovic
976184 oggi ha segnato un gol nella partitella stato bello per me lallenamento finito l
976185 oggi ha fatto tutto con la squadra e vedendolo lavorare con gli altri mi ha fatto capire che giocatore abbiamo per me una motivazione extra aiutare un ragazzo cos a fare qualcosa di speciale nella sua carriera si parla tanto di kak che ha vinto il pallone doro di messi e di ronaldinho ma quando lavoro due tre giorni con ibra capisco che lui speciale
976186 non esiste perdere cos ci dispiace per felipe ma dopo la gara che ha fatto pu tornare ancora pi forte ora lavoriamo duro in vista di valencia
976187 io credo che se fossi rimasto in testa alla prima curva la gara sarebbe stata diversa ha detto certo per la ferrari ha mostrato davvero un gran passo
976188 ho preso 4 punti e sono ancora in testa al campionato tutto sommato va bene cos
976189 quando hai gare come queste la prima cosa che viene in mente lo sconforto ha detto non abbiamo portato a termine il lavoro un periodo che va cos ma la cosa importante reagire subito abbiamo dimostrato il nostro valore in termini di prestazioni dobbiamo rimboccarci le maniche e continuare a lavorare siamo avanti nei costruttori ma la mclaren si avvicinata c tanto lavoro da fare ma abbiamo dimostrato il nostro potenziale hamilton ieri ha bucato ma rientrato e ha preso punti a noi non capitato ma dobbiamo voltare pagina
976190 dobbiamo lavorare su questo aspetto prosegue domenicali non possiamo permetterci di avere questi problemi perch li stiamo pagando a caro prezzo dobbiamo capire cosa successo al motore di massa non possono capitarci cose del genere ci ha privato di una vittoria meritata e importantissima non abbiamo avuto quellaffidabilit che fondamentale felipe ha fatto la gara pi bella della sua carriera e siamo molto dispiaciuti per ci che gli successo
976191 stato fantastico il modo in cui ha attaccato quando cera da attaccare e ha saputo gestire la gara fino agli ultimi giri per questo siamo molto delusi penso che felipe sia molto forte se hai la testa per gestire questo tipo di gara dopo una cos grande delusione devi fare un passo avanti perch diventi anche pi forte
976192 sono certo che andr via di qui con qualcosa che potr tornargli utile a valencia sar in forma
976193 giochiamo a memoria ma altri due acquisti ci permetterebbero di limare i nostri difetti
976194 sono soddisfatto a montecarlo siamo migliorati abbiamo ripreso il filo del discorso parlo del gioco e la nostra grande risorsa dopo tre stagioni si fa tutto a memoria
976195 vucinic pu giocare in due ruoli da esterno pu essere pungente parte e taglia verso il centro da centravanti cerca la porta e crea gli spazi per i compagni penso alloccasione sprecata da montella il fatto che io lo utilizzi da esterno non significa per che non abbia bisogno di unalternativa a sinistra serve un giocatore
976196 siamo quelli dello scorso anno quindi con i nostri pregi ma anche con i nostri difetti
976197 i due acquisti servono per completare i numeri ma anche per limare i nostri difetti
976198 la squadra va completata anche a destra se manca taddei sono in difficolt esposito ha altre caratteristiche
976199 volevamo la bestia abbiamo trovato la bestiolina non sempre sfrutta le occasioni che si costruisce con la forza del fisico ma ci penser domenichini a migliorarlo sul piano tecnico a firenze il primo batistuta si allenava mezzora al giorno per sensibilizzare il piede
976200 e andato meglio rispetto a bucarest ma avere davanti mexes e juan lo ha aiutato

976217 it would seem that science fiction is slowly turning into science fact in an internet of things based on ubiquitous network connectivity
976218 today in the 2000s we are heading into a new era of ubiquity where the users of the internet will be counted in billions and where humans may become the minority as generators and receivers of traffic
976219 the traditional dominance of industrialized countries in scientific and technological innovations will weaken in favour of less wealthy but no less tech savvy nations
976220 however we can make it talk less loudly if we put forward some of these issues early on things like privacy protection should become part of the design itself of the technology even before it makes it to market
976221 society will have to deal with some very substantial issues
976222 the rapid transition created by the network effect do not increase the digital divide
976223 its safe to say that technology today is more pervasive than we would ever have imagined possible 10 years ago

976227 strikt formeel kan dnb niet zelfstandig de inflatie te lijf met een renteverhoging maar in adviserende rol kunnen we wel degelijk wat doen we zitten in tal van adviesorganen die onder meer de sociale partners kunnen oproepen de lonen te matigen
976228 onze afdeling nationaal betalingsverkeer is wat afgenomen zo dragen de banken tegenwoordig grotendeels zelf zorg voor de distributie van bankbiljetten onze bijkantoren zijn gesloten maar bij de afdelingen monetair beleid en toezicht zijn de taken belangrijk verzwaard
976229 we geven gewoon de opdracht uit om een bepaalde hoeveelheid biljetten te drukken en wie dat het goedkoopst en best kan krijgt de order zo simpel is het
976230 omdat de risicos zo zijn toegenomen en ook de ingewikkeldheid van de beleggingsproducten is dat toezicht enorm veel zwaarder geworden wij moeten met de ontwikkelingen meegaan het is een constant leerproces

976233 among teens and young adults in particular who are arriving in emergency departments with serious and sometimes fatal injuries because they were not paying attention while texting
976234 we see this every day since we are in downtown chicago with lots of people walking around
976235 people are texting and they trip and fall on their faces usually people in their 20s we see a lot of face chin mouth and eye injuries from falls
976236 we see people rollerblading or biking while texting they are usually very skilled but sometimes crash and fall when they are not watching where they are going
976237 in march we were driving and saw a woman in her twenties step off the curb and get struck square by a pickup truck
976238 she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury you could tell she saw the truck at the last moment because her cell phone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet it was horrifying the truck stopped the driver was devastated i was amazed to hear she survived all the way to trauma center but died in the er

976246 during pride we took hundreds of pictures and we have a facebook group and when people sign up to that group we encourage them to show their membership to the irb member

976293 i didnt think the match would have been over today i thought we could give india a better fight
976294 i didnt think the match would have been over today i thought we could give india a better fight
976295 we fought every time we were down we fought very well to come back into this test match to get six wickets this morning in quick time and restricting india to 269 was a brilliant effort that gave us a good opportunity to chase these runs down
976296 its important we get a good start in any run chase
976297 we didnt get it and being down 10 for 3 wasnt ideal
976298 the bowling unit fought really well throughout the test and created opportunities for us and kept the indians under control
976299 the disappointment was in the first innings where we should have capitalised and put more pressure on the indians
976300 we should have got a few more runs on the board we played really good cricket for two to three days and we just lost it in the last two sessions of the fourth day
976301 a quick bowler like ishant is something for us to discuss ishant is an exceptional bowler
976302 he creates a bit of bounce on these kinds of wickets thats something which india has
976303 well have a chat with the selectors we have a few options in our squad and see what we can come up with
976304 going into the fourth day or fifth day of a test match you always know that when you have to face two top class spinners the mindset would be there but we always knew that the new ball is always going to be a factor on these kinds of wickets
976305 thats where you probably can pick up a couple of wickets thilan samaraweera showed a lot of character to hang around there and batted well but it was a bit too much for him in the end
976306 i am very happy for ajantha in his second test match to pick up ten wickets he bowled brilliantly and supported the other bowlers as well
976307 the last game was brilliant we got 600 runs one game you have a bad run you just cant point fingers and say this is bad
976308 it is just that we need to figure out a way of controlling situations a bit better especially under pressure and see how we can come out of it
976309 the results are what we expected to find given the changes in climate over the last 20 years
976310 because the uk is in the middle latitudes of europe we expected that recent climatic warming would favour species with ranges located in the south of europe and adversely affect northern species

976622 this was the first time that a foreign law enforcement unit has been deployed from a u s military ship to exercise another nations sovereignty over their waters

976649 are starting to get their act together and providing jobs for people
976650 so there are good things going on across the board
976651 and you also have to understand that the people of iraq are just tired of the fighting and it doesnt matter if youre sunni kurd shiia christian or syrians youre just sick of this unbelievably bad organization called al qaida which continues to do dastardly things throughout the northern areas and through the rest of the iraq so the people have stood up to these organizations as well
976652 were starting to transition those elements into other organizations such as a civil service corps to help rebuild roads pipelines projects things like that
976653 but were also seeing microgrants and microloans take charge and people actually getting normal work
976654 the government is starting to work a little bit more

976771 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
976772 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
976773 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
976774 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
976775 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
976776 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
976777 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
976778 when i get older i will be stronger theyll call me freedom just like a waving flag

976795 if i wanted to i could go that route and be respected not for my success respected for my music and my lyrics or whatever
976796 i did a mixtape called teen of the south with dj scream and i did that just to step my game up a little bit on that lyrical side but i wasnt really going into no album and just full fledge trying to switch my swagger and try to get respect from the game cause why would i show love to the game the game dont show you love back so i wasnt gonna do that and come back out and mess up my image and mess up myself i was going on the strength that i want respect from people who probably dont like me anyway so im gonna stick to what i do and stay being successful and ill do some mixtapes and some futures something like that
976797 polow da don did the beat thats all ill say polow did the beat i aint saying whos featured on it or nothing like that im just saying when it comes out we aint doing no leaks we aint doing nothing when it comes out straight video straight radio all in the same day
976798 im from south atlanta shawty lo from west atlanta gucci mane is from east atlanta and basically you know its swagger its all about your swag dudes going louis dudes going gucci dudes going prada so i was like let me go gucci real quick we hooked up went into the studio knocked the song out and basically its like three 12 bar verses we just spittin about how swagged out we are basically just a swag record i went in i did the beat
976799 that was gonna be my first single leading into my second album
976800 it was a hot record three million views on youtube two million plays all that but i didnt wanna go back that route no more like i was already successful with a big dance song this record was incorporated with a dance it was another big dance and it was about to take over again i told the record company i was like stop i dont wanna come back dancing cause the question that everybodys asking is like what am i gonna come back with so i could have took back over with that record but i think dancing is starting to get a little corny so i was like man im gonna hold off on that tip so i just threw it on the mixtape its heavy in the streets we gonna shoot an underground video to it
976801 basically the record is just talking about the fact that im successful in the industry so i got a lot of cheese
976802 i made 6 mil at 16 so basically im just saying im on a shopping spree just talking cash money thats all
976803 i went to barack obamas office right before he started running for president
976804 so you know we went in and talked and everything people were wondering what we talked about it was confidential but i was a firm supporter of barack even before he decided to run for the presidency so im all for it man were making history and were still going strong so make sure you vote obama believe that 08
976805 its great i want it back i want the records back
976806 he has the music its right there in the computer
976807 i stop by his studio every time and get something that adds something significant to my project each time im about to put a record out and i spend three or four days there to me hes the best producer in the game
976808 when i walk in the studio i record the first beat that comes on regardless if i think its a hit record or not
976809 we get in work mode get comfortable and go through the material thats in the computer dre always has hit records sometimes artists that need producers they need someone to create a direction for them musically i need the jewels hes just got laying around he dont gotta tell me what to do with it all he has to do is say track six or go to track eight hell have hits playing there you just have to get in and get them
976810 im waiting for the detox all i can say is dr dre is the best producer in my eyes just the consistency over the years he knows what he wants hes such a perfectionist that it becomes difficult for him to put it out
976811 when we came out i can say it now i actually hated puff daddy
976812 i can say that now cause puff is my man i was disgusted at what they was doing with the shiny suits and the blow up dolls and looking like missy i didnt agree with that i felt the shiny suit movement was destroying the grimy movement as i got older i learned to respect people for doing different things at that time pone was actually locked up i was on the streets and i would turn on bet and mtv it would be the shiny suit dudes it was a messed up time mase was killing them
976813 yall can say what yall wanna say about mase but he was killin them you almost wanted to throw on something shiny they caught remember jay with the sunshine video he had the ferris wheel the cyclone whatever it was real hard

976832 the vulgarity nostalgia and brashness of british holidaymaking in its full glory
976833 this is a two step process in giving professional pay for teachers
976834 first we need to ensure as a country that we have a competitive professional salary to attract teachers in the numbers required to ensure a qualified teacher in front of every single classroom no matter where it is in the country
976835 beyond that i restate our preparedness to negotiate a framework that further recognises and rewards demonstrated teaching skills knowledge and practice
976836 i like the idea of having a set of standards that are a way of recognising things when still in the classroom
976837 anything that gives you a roadmap for your professional development is definitely going to be helpful
976838 better ways to reward quality teaching certainly need to be developed and any reward system needs to be based on transparent standards for assessing teachers
976839 we need to find ways of valuing teachers who are teachers of excellence because we want to keep the best teachers in front of classrooms

976853 the wireline logging operations are still underway but already wireline logging has shown approximately 200 feet of pay in a developed sand interval that the logs indicate is hydrocarbon bearing following the completion of current wireline logging activities drilling will resume targeting further objectives in the well flow testing of the zone logged to date is planned thereafter once the well reaches its total depth
976854 we are very pleased with what we see on the logs that indicate encouraging hydrocarbons prior to fully penetrating all objectives in the well and we are excited about drilling to our projected td of approximately 18 000 feet subsea
976855 we are pleased to move forward with our partners to conduct flow testing on the bounty well we have completed the initial drilling of the well to approximately 17 360 feet along with the wireline logging and are now proceeding with running casing in preparation for our testing the testing operation will take approximately 30 days after which we will then commence operations on our next well the endeavour as we continue our initial three well programme on the intrepid block 5 c offshore trinidad

976868 this record felt like and still feels like from the writing to the recording a reclaiming of my own independence
976869 you begin to get yourself hung up on other peoples expectations and i dont think i do my best work when i think about what other people might think of the work im doing when you do that i think the process is robbed of its freedom a little bit so i kind of found my way to an independent streak on this record i was making the songs for the songs themselves and for me alone i never played them for anyone else and i didnt obsess about them too much id write a song and move on so theres a truthful feeling to the album
976870 when i make a record i finish it and i sit with it for a little while and inevitably ill write a couple more songs and its happened just about every time those other songs really shape the record and almost every time theyve had the title track of the record
976871 to me its a rock record in the vein of people that ive always loved like weezer or the pixies but i guess those bands have great pop sensibilities but to me i view them as rock bands
976872 if rock is popular at the time it becomes pop and i embrace pop music but it doesnt sound poppier to me so i just dont know if it is or it isnt ill take it if it is though because i think people enjoy that
976873 hes a fine producer in his own right and id never worked with a producer who had written their own songs and had success with them
976874 so i thought that that gave him a unique perspective on what i was doing and i thought he might work as a good sounding board for the songs ive got he taught me a lot because he has a great sense of melody
976875 im writing about the journey i have been on and my life has taken me in some weird directions
976876 some have been great some have been hard and i looked to those things and to the people that surround me and have drawn stories out of those experiences thats the one thing when you write about what you know as long as you keep living your life you dont run out of creative impetus

976891 the situation in east africa is dire with colleagues witnessing heartbreaking situations where severely malnourished children are struggling to survive

976929 ninety per cent of the cost of a fully configured server is its memory
976930 this ram in the cloud is paid off two to five times faster than in the corporate data centre
976931 people arent going to say they want to do distributed storage garrison says
976932 it will cause even more centralisation through virtualisation its wonderful for it people to have it all in one room where its all secured
976933 the move to 100gb is no different to what happened in the market 10 years ago
976934 after a decade it was becoming unmanageable so there was a shift to stm16 which was 2 5gb providing almost 16 times more capacity
976935 then in the late 1990s it went from 2 5g to 10g a jump of four times more
976936 its more focussed on the carrier space for wide area ethernet
976937 last year everything stalled because of the politics between 40gb and 100gb i would not expect to see it deployed in the telstra cloud for some years
976938 this will make it much easier over larger distances for more applications
976939 lets be aggressive and say in 2010 10g is selling at 1000 per port the rule of thumb for it managers is four ports of the old speed should cost about the same as the new port speed
976940 so a 1gb port today costs 500 while a 10gb port costs 2000 so after a while in about 2015 it will be 4000 for a 40gb port

976942 we have designed our technology to work with existing old fibre operators wont have to dig the ground to put in new fibre
976943 intel and amd now have products that are not duel core but eight core chips so you have eight cpus needing 1gb each thats why you need multiple gigabits per second to the outside world
976944 this is the first time the ieee has tuned the standard to specific applications
976945 imagine you have a pc and a bus and i unzip that
976946 the network is becoming a platform for a bunch of services google claims it can do computing for 10 per cent of the cost that you can do it yourself you dont even need a cpu
976947 es cierto que el paro ha subido en espa a y que ha descendido algo en la regi n pero lo que realmente le preocupa al pp es que haya diez mil parados m s en extremadura desde que el presidente de la junta de extremadura guillermo fern ndez vara ocupara este cargo
976948 hes probably got an ex girlfriend he was waiting on to leave
976949 maybe hes got an ex wife he didnt want getting the money
976950 maybe hes telling the truth maybe he was worried it would change him too much
976951 probably because he was still deciding on what to do hence not claiming the ticket doesnt that make sense
976952 so he was waiting for a woman and his child to leave the country

976981 patriotism is to support your country all the time and your government when it deserves it

977001 it is historys sorrow the grief of our era that i carry about me like an anathema
977002 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
977003 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
977004 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
977005 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
977006 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
977007 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present
977008 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
977009 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
977010 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
977011 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
977012 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come

977028 the sniper might miss he might get caught there would have to be retaliation and neither side wants to get caught up in that game

977043 helping adults commit and stay committed not only opens the door to a depth of emotional enrichment which a series of shallow and hedonistic encounters can never generate it also provides the best possible start in life for children
977044 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
977045 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
977046 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
977047 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
977048 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
977049 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
977050 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
977051 there is nothing in what this government is doing to show it understands how to respect devolved government that it appreciates the need for local government to go its own way that it comprehends how its policies are reducing social capital that it realises how the loss of local services weaken community relationships or that it even begins to appreciate how the demands of the centralised bureaucracy are eroding the civic the local and the voluntary
977052 and thats because i fear for gordon brown there really is no such thing as society only the individual and the state
977053 the sad truth is that if you are eligible for free school meals youre almost 200 times more likely to leave school without a single gcse pass than you are to get three as at a level
977054 but i do believe that we need to ensure that with a culture which encourages facilitates and celebrates success theres also a parallel culture of responsibility reciprocity and respect
977055 of those to whom much is given much is expected
977056 michael gove really has to be careful not to denigrate the high quality of education in englands schools in order to make his arguments
977057 schools are tired of being described as failing by politicians who simply want to create clear water between themselves and other parties
977058 while he is right to highlight the vital need for good local schools his proposals to increase choice and diversity of schools is diametrically opposed to that idea
977059 his proposals to increase choice and diversity and introduce a form of quasi voucher will undermine the social capital that he argues for and increase social segregation
977060 all the international evidence he refers to points to the damaging effect of choice and diversity on the efforts of countries to meet all childrens needs
977061 he seemed calm but looked like he was anxious to leave
977062 but when girls were down there he would just stare at them from the bridge
977063 sometimes hed say stuff like i wish i could get a girlfriend
977064 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
977065 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
977066 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
977067 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now

977092 they are trying to put the patient into a position to lose his or her life or to collaborate and we cannot agree to it
977093 are not experts on medical issues therefore they are required to take only security precautions into account
977094 interrogators then question the patient and demand information in return for permission to access care
977095 in some cases patients are asked to collaborate on a regular basis

977100 this market is having less of the fallout because look at the legs that balance our table
977101 its less about washington and more about their national strategy
977102 it is one thing to attract the blue chip companies such as covance
977103 but it is equally important that we have a thriving atmosphere that is conducive to small start ups
977104 lab users like to cluster more than any other industry
977105 the cost to build the space is about three times the cost of general office space so it is very expensive up front for a developer
977106 we wanted to demonstrate the actual utility of these particles
977107 were trying to adjust a lot to the time difference and so a lot of us are resting trying to get our bodies right getting a lot of massages we went out on the town to check it out but besides that we didnt do much
977108 sleep talk to my wife talk to my son and just probably play dominoes with tayshaun prince
977109 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
977110 probably the best thing is dont work out between twelve and four
977111 those are peak times during the day and thats when humidity and heat is going to be the worst
977112 id say for every five minutes take a two minute walk until you start getting acclimated to the heat and until the summer starts progressing
977113 the last thing you want to do is keep running
977114 you want to freeze turn to the dog without making eye contact and yell no so thats going to show that youre not intimidated but youre also not a threat you want to keep walking back and keep repeating yelling no until the dog either runs away or until youre able to find a safe spot

977118 the teacher was tough and demanding because she said agents and editors would be
977119 she was right she also told us that if we crafted a good proposal writing the book would be so much easier she was right about that too after i got my contract i wrote my memoir in only five months since i had a very specific and well thought out guideline
977120 with games like ours you get much more controversy when you add motion controls like you saw with manhunt 2
977121 we have weapons like chainsaws satchel charges stuff like that i can definitely see people having a problem and outcry towards that because it does actually feel like youre using weapons that way

977167 because the decentralized organization mutates so quickly it can also grow incredibly quickly
977168 centralized organizations depend more on structure and that tends to make them more rigid
977169 a catalyst is someone who every time they have a conversation with someone theyre actively thinking how can i help this person who can i introduce this person to i just want to help this person i just want to make this person better
977170 when confronted with an aggressive push most people shut down and become even less likely to change
977171 you dont follow a catalyst because you have to you follow a catalyst because he understands you
977172 in a command and control environment you can closely track what everyone is doing but being watched and monitored makes employees less likely to take risks and innovate
977173 great ideas come from people who are closest to the ideas
977174 the more the network grows the more useful it becomes and the more likely it is that customers will stay put
977175 each manager was empowered to make critical decisions while the executive team took on more of a catalyst role the executive team primarily made suggestions about strategy and gently coaxed the division leaders
977176 enough decentralization for creativity but sufficient structure and controls to ensure consistency
977177 its important to realize that when the rules of the game suddenly change its easy to be left behind were used to having things operate in a certain way we learn the rules and dont anticipate radical change
977178 institute order and rigid structure and while you may achieve standardization youll also squelch creativity where creativity is valuable learning to accept chaos is a must

977212 we dont really know what the actual effect on the climate is
977213 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the intergovernmental panel on climate change conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution

977251 huh is het nu al tijd maar ik moet nog met spelen en ik wilde nog doen
977252 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
977253 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
977254 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
977255 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth npower test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring that the team are properly prepared and play to their full potential starting on thursday
977256 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
977257 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
977258 kp pietersen is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
977259 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some used to someone else being in charge
977260 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday to realise it is an encompassing job
977261 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
977262 he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
977263 it is a brave decision because kp hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
977264 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
977265 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
977266 have agreed they can work together despite differences in their approaches to the game
977267 i take advice i love challenges i am going to give it a great go
977268 to captain your country is the ultimate honour in sport and i feel privileged and proud
977269 you have to really push if you want to score in a town without pushers

977274 theres nothing sharon can say that will make me feel angry or bad i couldnt live my life the way she lives her life

977280 there is a person without a companion without even a son or brother and though there is no end to all his struggles his eyes are still not content with riches so who am i struggling for he asks and depriving myself from good this too is futile and a miserable task two are better than one because they have a good reward for their efforts for if either falls his companion can lift him up but pity the one who falls without another to lift him up also if two lie down together they can keep warm but how can one person alone keep warm and if somebody overpowers one person two can resist him a cord of three strands is not easily broken
977281 god build warmth and intimacy into my life show me where and how to whole heartedly give myself to others for your purposes
977282 the plans of the diligent certainly lead to profit but anyone who is reckless only becomes poor
977283 you will find there is money being spent that you dont know is being spent
977284 statistics tell us that people will spend 33 percent more by using a credit card or debit card over cash
977285 there is less of a connection when you swipe a credit card than when you pull cash from your wallet
977286 if you are not currently paying cash for your cars consider making car payments to yourself now so that when the time comes for the next vehicle purchase you can write a check
977287 you want to be the banker instead of letting mastercard or visa be your banker
977288 i just kept renewing my policy because i had it automatically coming out of my checking account
977289 i hate to get on the phone with an agent it takes more time because you have to drag out your policy and go over it but i was shocked at how much i ended up saving for the exact same coverage
977290 you have to do two things look at past history and trust god

977307 so in the evenings i need a break from drawings to give myself a bit of serenity and calm plus to me there is so much visual pollution out there that im not always happy about so home should be a refuge from all that

977311 its only moving to the west at about 4 miles an hour and it still has some development to do
977312 the longer it takes to develop and the slower it moves the better our chances are for getting rain but it becomes a stronger storm too
977313 it looks like at this early point the track is going to be a little bit farther north of san antonio which leaves us on the dry side north of austin maybe and that will leave us on the dry side of the storm not to say that that wont be changing but at this point thats where theyre putting it
977314 because it might make an impact to the texas shore were looking at activating resources including search and rescue and maybe military forces
977315 have to be prepared for enhanced rainfall and gusty winds but as far as damage to the rigs or anything of the sort thats unlikely at this point
977316 we all needed staff development but since we were all on such a tight budget there wasnt much to do
977317 we started getting together in april to determine our biggest needs and what would have cost us 60 000 alone ended up costing each district only 13 000 which was awesome for all of us
977318 the majority of teachers are here for intrinsic reasons and like the choice and the collaboration
977319 they also like that its meaningful to their childrens needs
977320 this is our time to share with other teachers you get a lot more ideas
977321 every time i come to a session i hope to pick something up
977322 i never dreamed that it would have the effect that it would have
977323 i wasnt savvy enough at that time to realize that people use the media sometimes to shape and form outcomes
977324 in our hierarchy or organizations today whether they be civilian or military we have managers and leaders
977325 i have seen that many leaders tend to be good managers but not all managers are good leaders wendy martinson is the exception she epitomizes both
977326 im a product of the be all you can be jingle i enjoyed working in the nursing home but i knew that i probably wasnt going to be happy doing that for the rest of my life
977327 thats a reflection of the degree of loyalty the staff had to martinson as a commander
977328 as a commander she let folks know that she cared about them and not only about them as employees and people but she wanted to make sure they were resourced to do the job

977335 growing up she made all of our clothes we hardly bought anything
977336 then she went to work at the downtown baptist hospital as an x ray clerk and worked there 20 years
977337 she was a wonderful role model for all of us not only being a homemaker but also having a career she taught us how to have fun in life she taught us to be caring and loving

977731 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
977732 we consider this rate very attractive as it secures substantial revenues for two years starting from april 2009 up to and including the first quarter of 2011 at a strong average period daily rate of approximately 63 000 less 1 25 total commission there is rather limited advantage for the company to keep this vessel open in pursuit of a further possible spot market upside the nine months forward delivery date and the low commission structure are results of our efforts and ability to develop direct business with the industrys major charterers
977733 in this very challenging economic environment we are gratified that our customers have rewarded us with an 8 increase in sales our lead product first defense during the six month period ended june 30 2008
977734 first defense sales continue to be seasonal with lower sales expected during the second and third quarters

977738 advances in dental and medical imaging are creating extremely large amounts of data that must be transferred between diverse locations

977795 i was hoping the internship would help me decide on a major but its just making me want to do everything
977796 however give me almost anything in engineering and i will probably find it fascinating
977797 all the workers who would want to call me know that i am deaf so they just come visit me in the lab

977799 my lip reading is pretty good so i can usually make out what they are saying
977800 but it takes a bit more time and creates a lot of funny misunderstandings that crack us all up
977801 we happily took the bait with perhaps those least equipped to pay back the loans being the keenest to accept

977803 2011 is when we believe the bank will get back to break even and will move into profit in the years that follow
977804 do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues

977811 when health care providers tell patients to watch their carbs eat more fiber or to avoid saturated fats most people dont know where to start
977812 myfoodadvisor takes the guesswork out of that this tool appeals to so many looking for nutrition information people with diabetes because of the consistent portions of carbohydrates and proteins people with or at risk for heart disease because of the option to search by fiber sodium and saturated fats and people with kidney disease because potassium and phosphorous information is included which is not listed on standard nutrition labels
977813 sometimes the low fat version of our favorite foods contains more sugar or sodium than the regular version or the sugar free contains more trans and saturated fat
977814 it is a good idea to have the total picture before making a decision at the grocery store
977815 lets say for example you are trying to watch the amount of carbohydrates you eat but also trying to increase your fiber intake
977816 you can search for recipes that meet both of those needs
977817 if one person in the family has type 2 diabetes or heart disease chances are there are others around the dinner table who could be at risk as well

978033 the model to which policing and justice powers would be transferred
978034 the transfer of powers on policing and justice should have happened by may
978035 sinn f in want to see it happen in the short time ahead
978036 we have been involved in a series of meetings with the dup on this issue and we have agreed with the dup that powers would be transferred to a single department with a single minister elected by cross community support and that initially neither ourselves nor the dup would take on that ministry
978037 we have now asked the assembly and executive review committee to carry out a piece of work within a framework set out by office of the first minister and the deputy first minister

978044 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday
978045 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
978046 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
978047 we cannot rule out the possibility that overfishing has occurred

978059 that was the day goldie decided he would make a film and i would act in it
978060 but lifted the ban when we realised we would need them at every stage of our careers from that day abhi and i never thought of anything else but films
978061 and though we had a simple upbringing being the son of the countrys superstar wasnt easy for abhi
978062 holidays were fun we used to crave to do normal things goldie was in mayo and everytime he came down we would beg his mom to let us run errands like going to the grocer or the bakery
978063 i guess for abhi it was a walk of freedom without any unwanted attention
978064 amit uncle would makes us read fans letters written in hindi and explain the contents to him

978078 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the beginning we called the shots
978079 perhaps in googles world privacy does not exist but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
978080 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist in any event plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits
978081 when plaintiffs discovered these images rather than using the simple removal option google affords they sued google for invasion of privacy trespass negligence and conversion
978082 the response quotes and expands upon an existing legal opinion to help frame the response it should not be interpreted as a blanket statement on our views towards privacy google respects an individuals right to privacy we have privacy protections built into all of our products

978086 our industry right now is hungry for another round of innovation
978087 64 bit versions of windows will begin to find their way into high end gaming notebooks which increasingly are being used as high end notebook workstations as opposed to strictly gaming systems
978088 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
978089 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops
978090 obviously spore comes from a very strong pedigree and the title itself looks dynamic
978091 certainly the expectations are very high sales of several million units but i wouldnt put it in the realm of
978092 i think they dont need to appeal to anybody outside the hardcore wright and sims fans
978093 needs to sell in the millions and last a few years to pay back the investment but you know we were probably going to spend the money on something it might as well be on spore
978094 we dont provide financial breakouts for individual titles or any formulas we use in determining financial performance
978095 that said i can tell you that no one at ea is measuring spore with the yardstick created by the sims theyre two totally different animals spore is a game that has a lot to offer players long after they make the original purchase a much different business model than traditional video games
978096 while its important to have an actual game within the game
978097 i think gamers are so fascinated already with the creature creator and the ability to make buildings and spaceships that their expectations are going to be a lot lower than what ea would need in another game
978098 i think part of it will result from word of mouth and viral marketing
978099 is it something that people want to talk to their friends about friends and family taking notice and saying gee i want to do that as well its a little bit premature to say definitively whether spore will do that or not

978133 i learnt of my removal when a journalist phoned the night before i left for an official visit in china three weeks ago i thought it was just media speculation and brushed it off
978134 i was shocked to read in south african newspapers quoting anonymous sources saying i was fired as premier and people in china started asking questions it was humiliating
978135 information was leaked to the press with no attempt to actually call and inform me i was not given any opportunity to state my case as the law permits
978136 i expected them to give me a service delivery audit report and show me where i have failed but they said abantu bathi people say you have failed
978137 honestly i dont think i have done that bad i have served the people of the eastern cape with great passion and they love me
978138 i felt very lonely and alone the opposition had a field day as they would stand up and say even your own people said so

978142 death is a vast mystery but there are two things we can say about it it is absolutely certain that we will die and it is uncertain when or how we will die the only surety we have then is this uncertainty about the hour of our death which we seize on as the excuse to postpone facing death directly we are like children who cover their eyes in a game of hide and seek and think that no one can see them

978176 merkle only did what has been done in hundreds of championship games in the major leagues and what has been done a hundred times this year in such games
978177 the problem lay in what he did not do while he alluded to the impact a third out on a force play would have he did not comment on either the substance of the protest or the application of rule 59 had pulliam taken the lead of the pittsburgh press and directed his umpires to be aware of the gill play there probably would have been no merkle boner
978178 i call my cane merkle because it has a bone head
978179 it followed him his whole life you never knew when someone would start calling out that name
978180 i am from the place of the infamous fred bonehead merkle
978181 he enjoyed himself tremendously and was one of the last to leave
978182 its strange how things work out i never had such a good time it was worth it to talk to larry doyle everybody was so great
978183 alls forgiven fred merkle whose boner 42 years ago cost the new york giants the national league championship returned to the polo grounds yesterday
978184 its not really fair to say that fred merkles mental error cost the new york giants the 1908 pennant first of all it was common practise in those days to run right off the field after the winning run had scored
978185 i have done a report of some kind on the fred merkle story whether in print on radio or on tv on or about its anniversary september 23 virtually every year since i was in college i have often proposed september 23 as a nation day of amnesty in fred merkles memory
978186 the person who has heard the bonehead story and reads it will see that there is so much more than just the 9 23 08 play for these reasons i feel as though i am granting him his wish in helping forget or at least look past the infamous play
978187 the bostons are good players but we are the people
978188 helping adults commit and stay committed not only opens the door to a depth of emotional enrichment which a series of shallow and hedonistic encounters can never generate it also provides the best possible start in life for children
978189 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
978190 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
978191 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
978192 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
978193 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
978194 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
978195 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
978196 there is nothing in what this government is doing to show it understands how to respect devolved government that it appreciates the need for local government to go its own way that it comprehends how its policies are reducing social capital that it realises how the loss of local services weaken community relationships or that it even begins to appreciate how the demands of the centralised bureaucracy are eroding the civic the local and the voluntary
978197 and thats because i fear for gordon brown there really is no such thing as society only the individual and the state
978198 the sad truth is that if you are eligible for free school meals youre almost 200 times more likely to leave school without a single gcse pass than you are to get three as at a level

978200 of those to whom much is given much is expected
978201 michael gove really has to be careful not to denigrate the high quality of education in englands schools in order to make his arguments
978202 schools are tired of being described as failing by politicians who simply want to create clear water between themselves and other parties
978203 while he is right to highlight the vital need for good local schools his proposals to increase choice and diversity of schools is diametrically opposed to that idea
978204 his proposals to increase choice and diversity and introduce a form of quasi voucher will undermine the social capital that he argues for and increase social segregation
978205 all the international evidence he refers to points to the damaging effect of choice and diversity on the efforts of countries to meet all childrens needs

978214 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

978249 the show starts at 6 p m i dont know exactly how long it goes for but once it is over around 7 p m the opening ceremonies for peachfest will take place at okanagan lake park
978250 they had originally planned to come here last may but that was scheduled for a few days after one of their pilots died during a rehearsal so of course the show was cancelled but they promised to come back at a better time this year to make up for it and they kept their word
978251 because they are performing over water there can be no boats in the area beneath the show box and there can be no observers on munson mountain because they will be flying over it there are more than 100 volunteers working to put this show together and they will be supported by the rcmp
978252 its not threatening any structures overnight it got within about 500 meters of a trailer but there was a swamp between the structure and the blaze and crews hit that area really hard to keep the trailer safe it is not near any structures right now
978253 it was originally burning on some bad ground on a hill that was very hard to access and fight on crews worked overnight to bring it down off the hill to an area they can access better
978254 it has grown from when it was reported first saturday night it started off as about 10 hectares and is now around 30 however instead of having to fight it on bad ground by bringing it to us we can get our heavy equipment on it a lot easier
978255 we have a fresh crew on it this morning including two helicopters we will likely be ordering in another crew later today we dont have an estimate on how much of the blaze is contained but we are making good progress
978256 at this point if we get high winds that could be a concern because the area is so dry the entire south okanagan hasnt had much rainfall lately

978279 by hollywood standards maybe one would say that the first one wasnt as successful as other films in truth
978280 if you go by the actual business side of things i think nine times out of 10 there wouldnt have been a sequel from that movie
978281 while it had a nice core audience it wasnt a huge success at the box office so i was a little surprised when we came back to do the second one
978282 we were able to complete the entire 700 square kilometresurvey because weather and sea conditions were favourable forseismic data gathering
978283 we will not publish this data it will be used inconnection with a revision of the management plans for thebarents sea and the areas near the lofoten islands

978289 ian fleming could scarcely have imagined the longevity and influence of his most famous literary creation a british superspy named james bond three generations of fans have enjoyed agent 007s adventures in books on the big screen and on home video
978290 the action film genre was reinvented when dr no was released in 1962
978291 but it wasnt until goldfinger in 1964 that the bond movies exploded into a pop culture phenomenon
978292 it really shows the ability of the franchise to refresh itself
978293 i think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the films are still being made by the same family
978294 why was his path so short he had such an ability to create an amazing positive effect on lives it doesnt seem right that he had the short straw
978295 meetings with potential clients where 40 percent of the work he showed them was done by employees in their downtime
978296 i am pulled between two choices fidelity to my husband and continuing a dangerous flirtation with a man at work

978300 since we have a great high priest who has entered heaven jesus the son of god let us hold firmly to what we believe this high priest of ours understands our weaknesses for he faced all of the same testings we do yet he did not sin
978301 im a terrible person morally defective that i could even think such a thought
978302 each one is tempted when by his own evil desire he is dragged away and enticed then after desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and sin when it is full grown gives birth to death
978303 who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death thank god the answer is in jesus christ our lord so you see how it is in my mind i really want to obey gods law but because of my sinful nature i am a slave to sin
978304 it didnt happen to me so why should i care

978310 conduct layoffs now and youll spend even more to train a whole new batch once the economy picks back up
978311 banks struggling to recover from multibillion dollar losses on real estate are curtailing loans to american businesses depriving even healthy companies of money for expansion and hiring the scarcity of credit has intensified the strains on the economy by withholding capital from many companies just as joblessness grows and consumers pull back from spending in the face of high gas prices plummeting home values and mounting debt

978316 we have made our position abundantly clear to the israelis and indeed to the world not just in our public statements but in our private conversations as well
978317 there is uniformity across the u s government about the way to proceed with iran
978318 everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
978319 an american commitment to deterrence especially if seen by israelis as a substitute for prevention is itself likely to spur israel to consider independent action

978321 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
978322 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
978323 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
978324 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
978325 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
978326 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
978327 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
978328 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team
978329 that pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult
978330 it leaves a big hole for england and a really tough decision for the selectors to make just a year out from the ashes which is their stated aim
978331 national selector geoff millers stated preference is for a single captain in both forms of the game and that leaves the field looking pretty thin
978332 only pietersen stands out from the players that are currently playing both forms of the game both andrew strauss and robert key could be accommodated in the one day side probably at the expense of alastair cook but i think pietersen is the man they should go with
978333 there would be concerns about putting that workload on your best player but it could be the making of him
978334 people talk about his occasional lack of responsibility but i think that the captaincy could settle him down a bit
978335 strauss has done the job before in test matches and certainly showed some promise as a captain
978336 but that was when he was a key player in the side and at the moment im not sure he has totally cemented his place in the team again
978337 likewise it would be a tremendous amount of pressure to place upon rob key who should first be given the chance to prove himself in tests again
978338 he had been thinking about if for a while but kept it so close to his chest that i dont think many people would have been aware it was in his thoughts
978339 theres absolutely no doubt that michael vaughan is an exceptional captain and his record states clearly hes up there with the very best
978340 he was the right man at the right time to lead the team he had been given a more laid back captain than nasser hussain he gave the team the freedom it needed
978341 and he will always have the ashes win in 2005 as his crowning glory
978342 i have the highest regard for him as person sportsman and leader it is a great loss for world cricket
978343 i am very disappointed for michael vaughan and for england because i thought he was an excellent captain and leader
978344 i said on my radio show last week that i thought he should stay on as england captain
978345 he is a terrific player and like collingwood is probably only one innings away from resurrecting his form
978346 the timing is never right when to resign but it tends to be when you have lost a series i think that pressure from outside has built up sufficient for him to say enough is enough
978347 he was well respected by the players and i thought he should have waited until after india to make a decision but it is up to him and he has decided to do it now

978350 it is also our hope that through the games we can show the world the sincere aspirations of the chinese people to share the benefits of development and to join with the rest of the world in building a bright future
978351 the changes that are occurring in china are a microcosm of the changes in the rest of the world
978352 one billion television viewers are expected to watch live coverage of the opening ceremony on friday the beijing games will significantly advance our goal of universality and fair play in several ways
978353 at the same time many cash strapped americans are increasingly frustrated by higher ticket prices baggage fees airport delays and canceled flights that they are simply forgoing vacations that require air travel and staying closer to home
978354 it will seem like we are in a recession particularly for job seekers
978355 we are specially marking all drugs with stimulants with a label that says caution for athletes
978356 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets

978360 also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
978361 this is four days before the start and i wonder whats going to happen then
978362 there are many reasons for traffic jams and they are very hard to predict for example sudden torrential rain could cause snarl ups
978363 please believe that through our hard work we can ensure safety and punctuality over the olympics we will also do our utmost to give consideration to public transport to give people the most convenient service
978364 no thats north so it should be over there i think sorry im not sure
978365 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
978366 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
978367 our charts didnt show any reefs in that area at all we just hit this reef at 4 oclock this morning really heavily
978368 with school holidays in full swing we want to warn families to be aware of the dangers of tunnelling in sand
978369 wet sand as we have had today after rain makes it easier for tunnelling but sand is always very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
978370 im 31 years old i should be out there achieving something but i cant right now im hooked to this digital version of an iv drip with cocaine in it and i cant break free for the life of me
978371 you could tell he loved the game and thats all he wanted to do
978372 the way his younger teammates could look up to him go to him if they had something they needed to talk about i felt as if my situation was similar
978373 for all hes meant to us i thought that was the way for him to go out
978374 he made this unbelievable catch in right and some of the kids were teasing me that he should have been out there all along
978375 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between all cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
978376 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large in our particular study a six fold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
978377 while adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media are rare they are encountered regularly by all physicians who administer contrast material to patients and some of these reactions will require treatment
978378 we reviewed our experience to determine how often we encountered these reactions in our practice and how often the reactions required treatment we also wanted to know what happened to those patients who required treatment particularly when they had reactions that were moderate or severe
978379 commonly used medications can be administered safely however treatment errors are not uncommon and in a few instances can lead to patient morbidity
978380 in our study we found a number of instances in which non recommended treatment was provided these cases included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula rather than mask and at lower than recommended doses over utilization of diphenhydramine including to a few patients who were hypotensive and the administration of higher than recommended doses of epinephrine as well as occasional confusion about which concentrations of epinephrine should be injected in which manner subcutaneously or intravenously in our study the most striking example of patient morbidity from non recommended treatment occurred in the two patients who received doses of 1 mg of epinephrine in the absence of cardiopulmonary arrest who both had cardiac complications fortunately these complications were mild and transient and caused no serious morbidity
978381 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
978382 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
978383 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
978384 circumcision is the only new hiv prevention method to demonstrate consistent efficacy in randomized controlled trials
978385 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
978386 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
978387 even non physician health care providers will be able to learn this procedure to safely perform circumcisions in resource poor regions
978388 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
978389 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
978390 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
978391 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep

978457 those supporting bailey would have preferred that the probation service sought community support and assistance in dealing with that issue rather than recalling him to prison
978458 it was an overreaction as was the police decision to send 13 police officers and a helicopter to arrest him it has the potential to sour baileys future attitude toward authority

978522 we will see huge capital flows both from and to india in coming years and that is an opportunity for us as a financial information company as well as for international investors who want to take advantage of this profound trend
978523 la massoneria unistituzione universale operante in tutto il mondo e tesa al conseguimento di uno scopo elevato la ricerca verso la perfezione spirituale delluomo la massoneria unistituzione che lega tra loro gli uomini con il vincolo dellamore inteso come corrispondenza spirituale
978524 la massoneria ha per scopo il perfezionamento morale e lelevazione sprituale dellindividuo al servizio dellumanit
978525 i liberi massoni devono essere uomini buoni di buon carattere leali e di profondissima moralit non persone litigiose ostinate settarie ma uomini tolleranti donore rispettosi della giustizia e delle altrui convinzioni politiche e religiose
978526 la sua nascita si parla della ndrangheta ndr avviene sotto forma di societ segreta e non dubbio che il modello di societ segreta pi vicino pi simile pi aderente alla realt ai valori alle esigenze della delinquenza organizzata fosse rappresentato dalla massoneria e dalle societ segrete che fiorirono nella prima met dellottocento
978527 un lungo filo rosso unisce dunque ndrangheta e massoneria anche se stando alle pacifiche conclusioni alle quali sono pervenute indagini giudiziarie e storiche la reciproca compenetrazione delle due societ segrete si consolid a partire dalla seconda met degli anni 70 in singolare e non certo casuale consonanza con quanto avveniva dentro cosa nostra
978528 si tratta dellingresso dei vertici della ndrangheta nella massoneria che non pu avvenire se non dopo un mutamento radicale nella cultura e nella politica della ndrangheta mutamento che passa da un atteggiamento di contrapposizione o almeno di totale distacco rispetto alla societ civile ad un atteggiamento di integrazione alla ricerca di una nuova legittimazione funzionale ai disegni egemonici non limitati allinterno delle organizzazioni criminali ma estesi alla politica alleconomia alle istituzioni

978532 when theres a lot of speculation fans believe what they read the most important thing is to keep playing football and enjoy myself no matter what you are some fans will love you some hate you but most of the fans love me
978533 he felt people questioned his commitment in that situation you have to answer on the pitch you score goals and people forget quickly
978534 its normal because when there is speculation they believe in what they read
978535 for me the most important thing is to keep on playing my football and enjoying myself no matter what you are no matter what you have done some of the fans will love you and some of the fans will hate you
978536 but i hope im in a good situation most of the fans love me and thats the most important thing
978537 for me what happened in the summer is already behind me and now its up to me to play my game and score some goals

978567 how can you read something with a title like this
978568 many people are under the misconception that slackers are lazy when actually the opposite is true slackers are extremely fast and competent workers who simply dont want to be punished for their efficiency by having to do more work than is expected of others if running ten boxes of stock takes the average employee two hours to omplete then the slakcer thinks he should get two hours to do the job as well when the job only takes the slacker thirty minutes he just figures he should get so spend the other hour and a half any way he pleases employees who slack a lot but dont get their work done are not true slackers dont confuse slackers with animosity generators slackers avoide extra work not work in general they are good at what they do and have social graces they dont make things harder on others slackers are good to associate with because they have a lot of free time if youre swamped with your own work a slacker friend is usually available to do you a solid and help out

978575 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
978576 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
978577 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

978591 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
978592 play of the redskins is the perfect end to dream weekend
978593 we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
978594 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
978595 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
978596 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
978597 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
978598 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
978599 our demand for a self indulgent lifestyle is causing the oppression of poor people throughout the world
978600 our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed but that there might be equality

978603 but few will be able to put down jesus wants to save christians without a sense of self loathing
978604 oh i think i just had a thought that fell inline with that book i just read
978605 too many christians today are trying to improve on the gospel the gospel is what it is the cross of christ christians on both the political right and the left are downplaying the effects of the fall and instead buying into a secular myth of progress through market economics or socialism
978606 and instead buying into a secular myth of progress through market economics or socialism
978607 but it s just not that simple and thats a glorious thing the gospel is far reaching
978608 he is the god who stands against the injustice of empires that subjugate people with fear and power the later half of the book identifies the united states as the latest empire of oppression in line with egypt babylon and rome and begins to beat the social justice drum more loudly
978609 no matter how many times i see the bumper sticker that says god may not be a republican or a democrat the gist sure seems to be hes going to vote democrat and you should too
978610 besides the real oppression and the thing none of these guys have the integrity to talk about is the oppression of sin read jeremiah god put babylon in authority over the israelites because of their sin jeremiah 25 1 11 whats more he told them to suck it up and submit to nebuchadnezzar or else he would destroy them jeremiah 27 8 11 of course that message cant be put inside an emergent book no matter how snazzy the cover
978611 the real problem the ulitmate oppressor is something that resides deep in every human heart the real reason for their oppression is human slavery to violence sin and death theres an egypt that were all born into and thats what we really need an exodus from
978612 for it is time for judgment to begin at the household of god and if it begins with us what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of god
978613 my son do not despise the lords discipline and do not resent his rebuke because the lord disciplines those he loves as a father the son he delights in
978614 eschatologically we acknowledge that deliverance from oppressive governments is a
978615 i cannot begin to imagine how one might compare him bell with spong are you serious
978616 the politics of theology is becoming more divisive than discussions of sin anyway youre a driscollite youre a mclarenist or bellian
978617 but much more prevalent and more alarming is the number of churches that promote a stereotype of muscular male behavior as the only correct godly way to be
978618 no more nice guy timid and ashamed grab a sword dont be scared
978619 humanity in the image of christ is not aggressive and combative it is humble and poor

978623 i am the way and the truth and the life
978624 from my own experience the second life world is difficult to learn yet potentially addicting
978625 preach the gospel at all times and when necessary use words
978626 that said we are called to go and make disciples of all nations and second life seems to be a new nation of sorts so were called to be there as well second life will have its fair share of people seeking spiritual guidance and support it behooves all religions to have a presence there so that we can speak to our values be guides and mentors and assist with worship
978627 and second life seems to be a new nation of sorts so were called to be there as well
978628 seriously how many intellectually superior egoists do you know who are on the dole
978629 let someone define themselves and what they intend in a conversation
978630 you know one of the rules of conflict resolution and just being fair and mature is to let someone define themselves and what they intend in a conversation
978631 emergent christianity is an effort to respond to the gospel as it breaks through the age old crusts
978632 racist didnt i say i like heidi klum isnt she married to a black guy
978633 im sorry thats how i came across i was trying to tell stories of courage and hope but perhaps i focused too much on the challenges presented by other churches
978634 worse than mistaking an enemy for a friend is mistaking a friend for an enemy
978635 look this is how i see and this is how you should see it too now shut up and conform
978636 well he may see it that way but i certainly dont
978637 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
978638 oh you like to have sex we like sex too were cool come join us
978639 i hope they also have plans to increase their childrens ministry budget in the coming months
978640 or are we finally beginning to understand god s design for sex in marriage
978641 does an emphasis on sexual fulfillment or financial security or anger management or distract from the gospel
978642 satan does not care which extreme you pick as long as you pick one
978643 but we just wanted to have fun god not have a baby
978644 sex is great in a marriage and something to look forward to in the correct context but its quicksand until the context is right
978645 but to comment on evangelicalism s apparently growing fascination with sex i have to wonder what this looks like to nonbelievers
978646 conventional ministry wisdom goes something like this when launching a new church first analyze the felt needs within the target area or population then construct ministries to address those felt needs felt needs based ministries will draw people to your church and simultaneously positively predispose seekers to the gospel message in this scenario caring for peoples felt needs plays a supporting role in the mission
978647 the miracles validate the teachings which validate the acts which validate the fruit of the ministry which validate the miracles
978648 if jesus healed blind bartimaeus and the bleeding woman to restore them to full communion with god and his people something their handicaps prevented
978649 bread of god who comes from heaven and gives life to the world
978650 for judgment that those who do not see may see and those who see may become blind
978651 how can a church effectively invite people to die to self while constantly appealing to their self interests
978652 sheerakahn i dont think anyone wanted to convey that god rejects the handicapped the comments were made in relation to the fact that the jewish religious leaders of the first century certainly excluded those who didnt fit their perceptions of who was suitable for the kingdom
978653 i love the church its gods vehicle for transformation but i dont want the church to become so centralized that it cant reproduce cant adopt multiple forms and that works better when youre small when youre on the verge on the edge small is the new big big isnt bad but its overrated
978654 evidently the emergent movement is red hot gospel lava bursting forth from the confines of crusty old
978655 my jaw really dropped when jones described an emergent church in seattle the congregation came off as a band of intellectually superior egoists
978656 honestly assessing ourselves in light of gods holiness and our sinfulness
978657 self abasing lowered head unwilling to take a stand on anything deference
978658 you snakes you brood of vipers how will you escape being condemned to hell
978659 we are open and humble but you suck and your theology is wrong outdated and in need of my brand new never before seen even in the bible overhaul
978660 can the christian faith withstand the deconstructive doubts and curiosities of emergents of course it can that s not the point the point is that emergents may not be able to survive their chosen path
978661 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god did not consider it robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation taking the form of a bondservant and coming in the likeness of men and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death
978662 im weak and biased and the worst of all sinners but my hermeneutic and my theology is spotless
978663 pure bravado in one s certainty over ones understanding of god
978664 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
978665 moreover i have not witnessed another pastor who is so willing to confess his sins and mistakes in front of his congregation
978666 i believe that my god is real but you may be equally right that baal is god and so lets just live in harmony because none of us can really be certain
978667 you cant separate the two you cant say im weak and biased and the worst of all sinners but my hermeneutic and my theology is spotless
978668 now before half the class jumps all over me for being one of those arrogant emergents please let me explain
978669 im weak and biased and the worst of all sinners but my hermeneutic and my theology is spotless
978670 so the argument that my definition of humility excludes jesus as a model is miseleading or misguided or both
978671 those who are not brought to their knees in humiliation before god will not acquire the correct hermeutic or theology from him
978672 one thing is clear from the comments many contributors have a personal grudge against driscoll
978673 one cannot claim on the on hand to suffer from a depraved mindset a thoroughly corrupted ability to interpret reality and then say on the other hand almost magically that this is true except in the realm of hermeneutics and theology
978674 do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
978675 i guess it depends on how you define personal grudge
978676 i think guys like erwin mcmanus and john burke tend to deliver better on what i expected from vintage jesus how ageless truth is renewed within each generation
978677 all im ultimately saying is that revelation does not come in a vaccum state some people seem unwilling to admit this
978678 we just believe that his teachings on women are false teachings and that he has un christ like attitudes time will expose him
978679 lastly to sheerahkahn who asked me to succinctly describe emergent theology i would say that since emergent is not a denominational entity this doesnt really apply that isnt to say that people involved in emergent dont have theoligical stances they do but theyre not necessarily all in unison like on would expect of certain denominational groups though that too can be more complicated in reality so all that said all i can really do is speak for myself tony for himself brian mclaren for himself etc
978680 re whether we are arguing with driscoll or the bible i hear this kind of argument a lot i am accused quite often of being in opposition to the bible and absolute truth the error is really with those who select a few verses in the bible and determine that they override differing passages in the same book and those that argue that everything the bible speaks of is normative for all time are similarly in error
978681 stop oppressing me with your perspectives of truth because how can you know
978682 if mark can call people like rob bell and brian mclaren heretics then i dont think it is so preposterous to liken him to a
978683 we cant know anything conclusively and ill teach you conclusively why this is true
978684 for a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching they will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear
978685 of course theres a god just look at creation around you
978686 yeah ok so it is screwed up pretty bad thats the result of original sin
978687 well they just need to get their doctrine right and join the good and right guys
978688 well your child is going to not be a real human because they will have
978689 yes i think science is making claims based on an ever increasing body of evidence that homosexuality is as genetically based as any other trait
978690 o lord save me from the plots of evil men 2 the plan evil and stir up trouble so they can start a war 3 their tongues are like those of a deadly snake theres poison in every word they say 4 protect me lord from the power of the wicked and keep me safe from violent men who are determined to overthrow me 5 proud men are trying to trap me even in my own home they have laid their snares to trip me and spread their nets to catch me
978691 you are my god please hear my plea for help 7 o lord my god you are the only one who can defend me youve protected me many times
978692 i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent

978889 tv spots zijn gericht op het overdragen van emoties in 30 seconden met een lekkere geile gimmick dat is verschrikkelijk duur in vergelijking tot het effect voor massaproducten wellicht rendabel maar voor de meeste bedrijven en organisaties niet die zijn beter af met een productie van langere duur tegen lagere kosten waarin ze echt kunnen overbrengen wat hen bezielt

978899 the attacker walked around the village carrying the head of the victim in one hand and the cleaver in the other
978900 its hard to believe that people like this circulate among us

978910 the making of a residence order is a legitimate means by which to confer parental responsibility on an individual who would otherwise not be able to apply for a free standing parental responsibility order as in the case of someone who is not the natural parent
978911 not consider that the recorder inappropriately linked the question of relocation with the acquisition of parental responsibility in this case whilst legally they were separate issues they were in fact linked in the sense that the mothers desire to relocate to the south coast was as the judge found not simply a wish to move out of the same area as mr a but a move intended to consolidate her control over h in a manner which combined with the distance involved in the move raised real and justified fear of marginalisation on the part of mr a
978912 i do not consider that the recorder said or did anything to undermine the mothers position as biological parent albeit he made findings which were not in accordance with her wishes the recorder and for that matter mr a plainly recognised her status not only as a fact but as a feature which entitled her to be the primary carer of h

978924 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
978925 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
978926 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs

978940 most viewbar qa tests are going well with the exception of the ad servers it is still on track for an april release
978941 somehow some way despite all thats happened to him hes still sitting here with every opportunity in the world in front of him
978942 its one of those stories so crazy that its impossible to make up
978943 is going to be a part of my life forever
978944 then we built a one room house and slept on cots our porch was our kitchen we drew our water from a well and there was an outhouse for us to use up the hill
978945 she had plenty of money so its not like we had to live like that she just wanted it that way she never wanted us to get caught up in material things
978946 he had become a little rebellious a little hard to control at times its not like he was a bad kid michelle just thought that living with his father would do him some good
978947 she said how excited she was that i was coming home and about how glad she was that i was her big brother
978948 she had this big smile and freckles my mom named her after bob marley you can imagine how cute she was
978949 he was the only one with keys to certain locks
978950 people testified that he was planning to do something like that but he still didnt go to jail
978951 i tried to remember the happy days i spent with them
978952 but there were so many times when i thought why didnt i change the locks on the house
978953 he thought he shouldve been able to save his mother
978954 we had never had much of a father son relationship
978955 now all of a sudden i was living with him i was used to being the man of the house and now i had all these strict rules we just never saw eye to eye on things
978956 the problem was that hugh was used to having no rules he had always been bigger than everyone so he could buffalo everyone around
978957 you cant hold down a job if you cant listen to authority growing up without me or any kind of a father figure in his life put him at a disadvantage
978958 that was right after my mom died and i had a short fuse
978959 its not like i was going around looking for fights but if someone came up and said something to me i didnt think i just acted
978960 the reason the department of health and welfare stepped in was because they said you can spank your kid but you cant leave a mark
978961 but how can you spank a kid with a belt and not leave a mark
978962 hes never been hit hes never been punched hes never been slapped ive given him three spankings in his life and we prayed after each one he had more spankings by his mom than hes had by me hes never been abused
978963 i dont even think they were trying to be racist or mean
978964 that was one of the best semesters he ever had in school all as and a b
978965 he started seeing that football could really take him somewhere and he started to focus
978966 he had a good thing going here its a shame he couldnt work things out with his father
978967 he told me that if i wasnt going to live with him i wasnt going to live anywhere in the state of idaho
978968 hes a good kid but hes had a rough patch
978969 i made every possible attempt to set him up for success now its up to him we love him were still rooting for him we pray for him every day
978970 the bottom line is that hugh has an image in his head that hell never get rid of the image of finding his mother
978971 hes still got a lot of unresolved anger from her death hopefully thats something he can fix
978972 when he walked through our door a few months ago i thought oh my
978973 you can take one look at his body and tell that hell be playing on saturdays and maybe sundays too the thing our players will come to realize is that having hugh here will create opportunities for other people
978974 no one is going to overlook him now there are a lot of big kids out there but the things that set hugh apart are his strength and the way he moves he runs around out there like hes 220 pounds
978975 he walked up to me stuck out his hand and said i hear youre one of the captains
978976 you can see that he doesnt have a big ego there may be some people who are still warming up to him but i dont think theres anyone who doesnt respect him
978977 a few weeks ago i was with them eating caviar and smoked salmon
978978 ive seen jamaican wealth and jamaican poverty ive experienced racism and tragedy all of it has made the person i am today
978979 she was a free spirit who opened her heart up to the whole world
978980 but the person who did this to them i forgive him ill always be mad at him but i forgive him it hurts me to say that it really does but i dont want to go through life with bitterness anymore i dont want to be an angry person thats not how my mom wouldve wanted me to live
978981 if youre stuck on the past how can you move forward
978982 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
978983 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
978984 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul collingwood and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
978985 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring the team is properly prepared and plays to its full potential starting on thursday
978986 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
978987 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure that he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
978988 we were expecting the prime minister of canada to do the right thing the right thing was like the chinese head tax

979011 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
979012 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
979013 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
979014 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately
979015 disappointed that we have not yet been able to move this bill out of the senate
979016 i think we can make this work and all i care about is the end result

979071 mah ha scritto 23 luglio 2008 19 04 per marco cattaneo non ho capito il trasalimento il fatto che ci sia chi semina disinformazione a livello nazionale giustifica il direttore responsabile di le scienze a fare altrettanto cos una gara a chi la spara pi grossa
979072 sul discorso della captatio benevolentiae sono ancora daccordo vero si sfrutta la disinformazione cavalcandola ma proprio quegli obblighi di correttezza richiesti alla stampa non sono forse da rivolgere anche al direttore responsabile della maggiore rivista scientifica divulgativa italiana rivista che in campo biologico ha sempre mantenuto un livello quasi tecnico

979088 cambiare la regolazione dellespressione genica non significa alterare geneticamente un organismo
979089 che linnesto trasporti flusso genico banalmente vero come vero che ogni volta che un essere vivente entra in contatto con qualcosaltro molto probabilmente rilascia piccole quantit di materiale genetico e il senso dellinnesto proprio che questo scambio non cambia il genoma della pianta innestata altrimenti non avremmo il frutto della pianta innestata che invece proprio ci che vogliamo preservare ma ne modifica tuttal pi la regolazione la resistenza ecc sulla base di quelle della pianta su cui innestata i cambiamenti pi o meno profondi che ne derivano sono ben diversi strutturalmente e funzionalmente dal tipo di quelli ottenibili con lingegneria genetica

979107 perch devo avere una capacit di produzione energetica ridondante che in gran parte spreco per il solo fatto che ho un picco di assorbimento tra le 16 00 e le 18 00 di ogni giorno posso in qualche modo evitare questa situazione
979108 aspo ritiene preoccupante lattuale polarizzazione politica dellenergia con le rinnovabili viste come di sinistra e lenergia nucleare vista come di destra
979109 io penso che i tedeschi non siano cos stupidi da montare impianti inutili solo perch i verdi ne traggano vantaggio
979110 si sovvenziona qualche pannello cosi i grunen possono essere rieletti
979111 si sovvenziona il nucleare cos i partiti della acquistano voti

979123 mentre scajola riapre il dibattito sul nucleare distogliendo lattenzione sulle vere priorit del paese rispetto alla sfida del clima alla dipendenza dai combustibili fossili ai rischi di approvvigionamento e di aumento dei prezzi del petrolio il governo tedesco proprio oggi vara un pacchetto energetico che raddoppia lutilizzo di energia da fonti rinnovabili e conferma la chiusura delle centrali nucleari per il 2020
979124 si tagliano fondi per il potenziamento dei treni e del trasporto pubblico locale che sono soluzioni immediate per migliorare la qualit della vita ridurre linquinamento e il traffico privato e quindi il consumo e i costi di petrolio
979125 il nucleare conclude realacci oggi viene presentato come una fonte di energia sicura pulita illimitata e di basso prezzo non cos purtroppo anche tralasciando le questioni irrisolte di sicurezza e scorie il nucleare ha segnato il passo in questi anni in occidente proprio per i costi elevati con questa scelta il nostro paese si avvia ad intraprendere una strada sbagliata ed anti economica
979126 posso aggiungere che il ciclo giorno notte dovrebbe essere garantito per esempio nel progetto archimede che prevede laccumulo dei sali fusi che manterrebbero temperature sufficienti a renderli operativi per 12 ore
979127 chelyabinsk 40 e meglio noto come mayak parola che significa faro fu costruito a partire dal 1945 e reso operativo per la produzione di plutonio gi a dal giugno del 1948 la prima bomba atomica sovietica fatta esplodere nellagosto del 1949 giusto in tempo per il settantesimo compleanno di stalin fu costruita utilizzando plutonio prodotto a mayak
979128 lying 1400km east of moscow close to the kazakstan border mayak has been the key soviet and russian military nuclear facility for over 50 years
979129 la minaccia di una nuova catastrofe per i cittadini della regione di mayak si prospettata nel 2001 quando il ministero dellindustria atomica minatom della russia ha offerto la centrale di mayak come luogo di scarico di scorie e rifiuti radioattivi provenienti da potenziali clienti come germania gran bretagna svizzera spagna giappone corea del sud taiwan con la prospettiva di ricevere 20 milioni di tonnellate di combustibile nucleare esaurito per un totale di 20 milardi di dollari
979130 se le rinnovabili diventano solo una parte del mix energetico totale
979131 io sono costretto a confermare che il primo intervento di micallo lo faceva sembrare un peracottaro
979132 saresti disposto ad avere una centrale nucleare o un deposito di scorie nucleari vicino a casa tua
979133 older fuel produced by the once through system in dry storage casks represents a negligible addition to the existing nuclear hazard to the surrounding population
979134 cosa che se non erro accade al gas che ci arriva dallangola liquefatto e per essere rigassificato viene portato in normandia da dove poi i francesi ce lo rimandano rigassificato
979135 una delle cose curiose che in questi gruppi c chi sostiene che se gassificatore sha da fare ebbene che sia di gas di petrolio liquefatto non di metano
979136 mayak uno dei luoghi pi inquinati della terra ove si trova il pi grande complesso nucleare dl mondo e che anche lunico sito di riprocessamento di scorie nucleari in russia e un vera testimonianza di cosa pu generare lumanit contro se stessa

979143 la grande mole di informazioni che finora avete pubblicato su questo blog interessante ma riportata con una certa enfasi soltanto sui siti di alcune pur meritevoli e ammirevoli associazioni ambientaliste ci sono pubblicazioni scientifiche certo ma alcune di queste come gi stato detto ripetutamente non hanno alcuna valenza epidemiologica sostenete che i rapporti oms iaea sono carta straccia e sottolineate con dovizia studi pubblicati su riviste di secondordine e che allo stato delle cose non hanno ancora dimostrato molto per il momento la questione dei danni provocati da deboli dosi di radiazioni estremamente aperta

979158 il sogno nucleare si trasformato in un incubo economico e di sicurezza per il contribuente britannico lentit dei problemi di sellafield non stata completamente spiegata alla popolazione la ricerca dimostra che la situazione sta divenendo rapidamente peggiore
979159 il governo sta cercando di ingannare il pubblico per fagli credere che ci non pu avvenire la prossima volta anche se levidenza dimostra il contrario
979160 vi sono lavoratori che si gireranno i pollici perch non vi denaro disponibile per effettuare il lavoro di decommissioning e non c denaro per pagare i lavoratori che vanno via
979161 gli impianti per le energie rinnovabili non devono essere n dimensionate n progettate n pianificate in tempi e costi da noi
979162 alla fine il governo dovr fornire pi finanziamento alla nda e pagarsi il lavoro di decommissioning
979163 vedo con piacere che dopo ripetuti inviti posti con innegabile educazione e cortesia anche gli avvocati del coordinamento hanno cominciato a citare delle fonti i costi della centrale di olkiluoto certo quando la notizia vera ed ampiamente risaputa la cosa diventa facile ma insomma lepisodio pu essere interpretato come conseguenza positiva dellindiscutibile valore socio culturale di questo blog marco cattaneo nonostante il suo ormai proverbiale pessimismo possa ritrovare qualche piccolo segno di speranza
979164 possiamo dire che con il denaro di una centrale nucleare si costruiscono 10 12 centrali termoelettriche tradizionali
979165 tali centrali poi le facciamo funzionare ad energia solare che non costa niente ed a disposizione di tutti

979167 in spagna che sta procedendo molto rapidamente verso le rinnovabili alcune nuove compagnie hanno fatto un sacco di soldi proprio realizzando soluzioni
979168 un dinosauro un reattore vecchio che cercano di ammodernare e che alla fine avr costi di produzione dellenergia troppo elevati
979169 come e stato detto e stradetto su questa rivista il nucleare puo servire per la produzione di energia
979170 dopo il disastro delllz 129 hindenburg lopinione pubblica si convinse che il gas fosse troppo pericoloso per continuare a usarlo in questo campo
979171 lidrogeno un gas altamente infiammabile e forma con laria miscele esplosive campo dinfiammabilit in aria a pressione atmosferica 4 74 5 reagisce inoltre violentemente con il cloro e il fluoro basta liberare una fuga di idrogeno a contatto con ossigeno per innescare una violenta esplosione oppure una fiamma invisibile che produce acqua in gas
979172 una conseguenza di solito negativa ma a volte desiderata dellidrogeno la sua azione infragilizzante sui metalli
979173 in spagna che sta procedendo molto rapidamente verso le rinnovabili alcune nuove compagnie hanno fatto un sacco di soldi proprio realizzando soluzioni
979174 non c abbastanza acqua nel mondo per gestire impianti nucleari temo che non sia noto a tutti che circa il 40 dellacqua potabile francese serve a raffreddare i reattori lestate di cinque anni fa quando molti anziani morirono per il caldo uno dei danni collaterali che passarono sotto silenzio fu che scarseggi lacqua per raffreddare gli impianti come conseguenza fu ridotta lerogazione di energia elettrica e morirono ancora pi anziani per mancanza di aria condizionata
979175 non capisco i termini della discussione in corso in italia amo il vostro paese lo seguo da anni ma questa volta mi sento davvero perso i sostenitori dicono il nucleare pulito non produce diossido di carbonio quindi contribuir a risolvere il cambiamento climatico un ragionamento che non torna se solo si guarda allo scenario globale oggi sono in funzione nel mondo 439 centrali nucleari e producono circa il 5 dellenergia totale nei prossimi 20 anni molte di queste centrali andranno rimpiazzate e nessuno dei top manager del settore energetico crede che lo saranno in una misura maggiore della met ma anche se lo fossero tutte si tratterebbe di un risparmio del 5 ora per avere un qualche impatto nel ridurre il riscaldamento del pianeta si dovrebbe ridurre del 20 il co2 un risultato che certo non pu venire da qui
979176 un dinosauro un reattore vecchio che cercano di ammodernare e che alla fine avr costi di produzione dellenergia troppo elevati
979177 1 anche se il nucleare ha basse probabilit di incidente grave se succede pu causare milioni di vittime un solo incidente concentrerebbe il dramma di migliaia di incidenti inoltre il rischio di contaminazione renderebbe una vastissima zona inabitabile per almeno 100 150 anni
979178 2 ha una mostruosa necessit di acqua per il raffreddamento in francia il nucleare consuma il 40 di acqua disponibile sottraendola al consumo in un clima che va desertificandosi costringerebbe la chiusura di molte centrali
979179 3 lo stoccaggio di scorie radiottive per migliaia di anni un problema non ancora risolto
979180 4 luranio un minerale che come il petrolio in via di esaurimento da qui a 20 anni quando dovrebbero essere pronte le nostre sic centrali avr un costo presumibilmente proibitivo
979181 5 in un paese dove non si riesce ne a aprire discariche comunque dannose ne a costruire inceneritori comunque cancerogeni pm2 5 pm1 eccetera vorrei vedere convincere la popolazione a costruire una centrale nucleare
979182 6 e una scelta di potere centralizzare lenergia significa avere un maggior controllo e una maggiore manipolazione sulla gente questo non sarebbe possibile in misura nettamente minore con le energie rinnovabili
979183 unaltra riflessione utile mi sembra quella di considerare falsa lalternativa rinnovabili non rinnovabili quando probabilmente occorre prevedere un mix di fonti energetiche alternative che depotenzino la nascita di possibili monopoli oligopoli nellofferta
979184 sempre in prospettiva sintende non oso immaginare in quanto tempo sia possa verificare lopportuno rinnovamento del parco macchine circolante
979185 i risultati prodotti dalla commissione oms iaea sono carta straccia perch non vengono presi minimamente sul serio da chi si occupa di radiobiologia
979186 i risultati prodotti dalla commissione oms iaea sono carta straccia perch non vengono presi minimamente sul serio da chi si occupa di radiobiologia cattaneo non puoi continuare a negare solo per salvare la faccia
979187 quanto alle possibilit di guarigione di chi si ammalato credo che le notizie gliele dar il medico curante la francia ha un eccellente sistema sanitario

979192 il terrorismo sui rischi sanitari dei campi elettromagnetici che vuole imporre limiti precauzionali ingiustificati enormemente pi bassi di quelli accreditati dalla comunit scientifica internazionale e adottati in tutti i paesi industriali
979193 il permanere di una condizione di emergenza nel trattamento e nello smaltimento dei rifiuti di ogni tipo condizione che figlia dellopposizione aprioristica a soluzioni tecnologiche adottate da decenni in tutti i paesi industriali avanzati
979194 la preclusione dogmatica dellenergia nucleare che penalizza il paese non solo sul piano economico e dello sviluppo ma anche nel raggiungimento di obiettivi di razionalizzazione e compatibilit ambientale nel sistema energetico
979195 un fantasma si aggira da tempo nel paese un fantasma che sparge allarmi ed evoca catastrofi terrorizza le persone addita la scienza e la tecnologia astrattamente intese come nemiche delluomo e della natura e induce ad atteggiamenti antiscientifici facendo leva su ingiustificate paure che oscurano le vie della ragione

979211 underpricing a home to create an auction like frenzy started on really great homes in nice neighbourhoods
979212 now everyone is doing it on any old piece of crap
979213 its detrimental to the seller you might have 19 bids but only two people can really afford the house because youve attracted everyone else who cant with a lower listing so its completely artificial
979214 and of course the house is going to sell over asking because its underpriced in the first place
979215 we need to generate some cash in order to stay in business and one of the ways to do that is selling the property and staying as a tenant

979300 the indignation over the raid on rascals galvanised them into action and thus people like us was born
979301 as a society often incapacitated by a need to observe rules the rascals who dare to ignore bend or break rules get things done activists pushing maverick causes bloggers who go where media dare not street protesters who remind us of the right of free association its time we learn to celebrate these rascals more

979307 a lot of scholarships dont even look at your grades or test scores the arts recognition and talent search ts based on submitting an artistic portfolio not on grades and test scores other programs your write an essay or deliver an oration
979308 these merit based scholarships you apply for which merit doesnt mean just grades and test scores they never look at your finances so its a great way to fill in those need based financial aid gaps its for students of all incomes
979309 sometimes people wait until the school year begins theres a lot of deadlines that happen early on in the school year people miss out on
979310 i missed out on a lot of those a lot of people do but you can start as early as middle school that being said its never too late
979311 its a huge mistake because partially this is a numbers game you want to apply for at least a dozen scholarships and once youve applied for one or two you can recycle re think re use what youve already done youve already done sixty percent of the work to apply for ten

979319 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
979320 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
979321 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent

979323 we are extremely pleased to announce the launch of our operations in egypt
979324 as the arab worlds most populous nation with the economy growing at around seven per cent annually there is tremendous potential for real estate financing in egypt this demand has been further accelerated by the introduction of mortgage law of 2001 and several government led economic reforms
979325 tamweel emirates will forge strong relationships in egypt and work with the government and leading developers to ensure that we are able to make a lasting contribution to egypts economic growth and diversification
979326 we will introduce our award winning sharia compliant real estate finance solutions as well as new ones designed to meet the particular needs of the egyptian market we hope that our unmatched service and wide ranging product portfolio will allow many to realise their dream of home ownership
979327 nuestras observaciones y modelos demuestran que este fue un evento bastante inusual que se comprende mejor e t rminos de un objeto en el l mite entre una supernova normal y un estallido de rayos gamma
979328 es una idea muy antigua pero nadie hab a realizado los c lculos num ricos para ver lo que suceder a cuando un gran asteroide impact en marte
979329 las dos explicaciones principales que se han propuesto para la dicotom a hemisf ricas son alg n tipo de proceso interno que cambi una de las mitades del planeta o un gran impacto en uno de ellos
979330 el impacto tendr a que hacer sido lo suficientemente grande como para hacer estallar la corteza de la mitad del planeta pero no tan grande como para fundirlo todo demostramos que realmente se puede formar la dicotom a en esta forma
979331 las dos aproximaciones son muy complementarias coloc ndolas juntas te da una visi n completa
979332 el modelo bidimensional proporciona alta resoluci n pero s lo puedes observar impactos verticales el modelo tridimensional te permite ver los impactos no verticales pero la resoluci n es menor de forma que no puedes rastrear lo que sucede en la corteza
979333 colisionan con otros cuerpos de tama o comparable en gigantescos impactos la ltima de estas colisiones define el planeta
979334 el cad ver estelar llamado sgr 1900 14 pertenece a una clase de objetos conocidos como magnetares o magnetoestrellas estos objetos son los n cleos de estrellas masivas que explotaron en forma de supernova pero a diferencia de la mayor a de otras estrellas muertas stas poseen un campo magn tico extremadamente fuerte
979335 el anillo fue encontrado por casualidad estaba revisando datos de archivo de spitzer y as me di cuenta de que sgr 1900 14 estaba rodeada por un anillo que no hab amos visto antes
979336 el universo es un lugar muy grande y cosas raras pueden suceder
979337 el cual no se parece a nada que se haya visto antes se form en 1998 cuando la crujiente superficie de hierro de la magnetoestrella se rompi y provoc una enorme erupci n la explosi n fue tan poderosa que incluso ioniz las capas superiores de la atm sfera de la tierra y sobrecarg los instrumentos de varias naves de la nasa
979338 estaba rodeada de una nube de polvo y la explosi n excav en ella dejando un anillo de polvo en las partes exteriores el anillo tiene forma ovalada con dimensiones de aproximadamente siete por tres a os luz aparenta ser plano o bidimensional pero los datos no descartan la posibilidad de la presencia de un cascar n tridimensional m s complejo
979339 es como si la magnetoestrella se hubiera convertido en una enorme antorcha ardiente que destruy el polvo a su alrededor creando de ese modo una gran cavidad
979340 las estrellas cercanas iluminan el anillo de tal forma que spitzer lo puede ver un anillo de fuego que marcar a la magnetoestrella para toda la eternidad
979341 los anillos y las esferas son comunes en el universo por ejemplo las estrellas masivas j venes usan su viento estelar para crear burbujas en el espacio moldeando a las nubes de polvo hasta convertirlas en figuras esf ricas despu s cuando esas estrellas mueren en forma de explosi n de supernova sus restos son expulsados y forman bellas estructuras esf ricas llamadas remanentes de supernova los anillos tambi n se pueden formar alrededor de estrellas que han explotado y cuyas capas de material en expansi n chocan contra nubes de polvo preexistentes provocando que el polvo brille como en el caso de la remanente de la supernova 1987a
979342 pero el anillo alrededor de la magnetoestrella sgr 1900 14 se a adi no encaja en ninguna de estas categor as en primer lugar los remanentes de supernova y el anillo alrededor de 1987a emiten rayos x y ondas de radio el anillo alrededor de sgr 1900 14 no lo hace solamente brilla a ciertas longitudes de onda en el infrarrojo que el spitzer puede ver
979343 al principio los astr nomos pensaron que el anillo alrededor de sgr 1900 14 se trataba de un eco infrarrojo esto ocurre cuando un objeto lanza una onda explosiva la cual calienta el polvo y lo hace brillar con luz infrarroja pero cuando volvieron a observar a sgr 1900 14 posteriormente el anillo no se hab a movido hacia afuera como lo hubiera hecho un eco infrarrojo
979344 un an lisis m s profundo revel que el anillo es muy probablemente una cavidad esculpida en una nube de polvo un fen meno que debe de ser bastante raro en el universo ya que no se lo hab a observado con anterioridad este descubrimiento podr a ayudar a los cient ficos a entender si la masa de las estrellas influye sobre el hecho de que se conviertan en magnetoestrellas al morir
979345 sgr 1900 14 est interactuando con su entorno causando un gran impacto sobre la regi n que la vio nacer
979346 la formaci n de una barra puede ser el importante acto final en la evoluci n de una galaxia espiral
979347 las galaxias se cree que se construyen a s mismos a trav s de fusiones con otras galaxias tras asentarse la nica forma dr stica para que evolucionen las galaxias es a trav s de la acci n de las barras
979348 se forma mayormente en las galaxias m s peque as de menor masa
979349 sabemos que la evoluci n en general es m s r pida para las galaxias m s masivas forman sus estrellas antes y m s r pido y entonces se apagan en discos rojos
979350 las galaxias de masa baja tambi n se sabe que se forman m s lentamente pero ahora vemos qu tambi n forman sus barras m s lentamente
979351 se cierran cada vez m s estas rbitas alargadas haciendo la barra cada vez m s fuerte finalmente una alta fracci n de las estrellas del disco interior se unen a la barra
979352 empujan al gas y las estrellas fuera de su circuito normal en rbita alrededor de las regiones centrales tal vez incluso canalizando gas hacia el agujero negro supermasivo central
979353 sin este alimento los agujeros negros quedar an hambrientos y las regiones centrales de las galaxias carentes de j venes estrellas
979354 las barras en formaci n reciente no est n uniformemente distribu das a trav s de las masas de las galaxias sin embargo y ste es un hallazgo clave en nuestra investigaci n
979355 se est n formando principalmente en las galaxias menores de baja masa mientras que entre las galaxias m s masivas la fracci n de barras era igual en pasado que ahora
979356 sabemos que la evoluci n es generalmente m s r pida para las galaxias m s masivas stas forman sus estrellas m s tempranamente y m s r pido las galaxias de menor masa forman sus estrellas m s despacio pero ahora vemos que tambi n crean sus barras m s lentamente a lo largo del tiempo
979357 las peque as elongaciones en las rbitas de las estrellas crecen y quedan encerradas en un lugar creando la barra sta se vuelve m s fuerte al encerrar m s y m s de estas rbitas elongadas finalmente una gran fracci n de estrellas en la regi n interna de la galaxia se unen a la barra
979358 la formaci n de una barra podr a ser el ltimo acto importante en la evoluci n de una galaxia espiral las galaxias se cree se forman a trav s de las fusiones con otras galaxias luego de establecerse la nica dram tica manera de evolucionar es a trav s de la acci n de las barras

979360 una delle prime cose che ho imparato agli inizi della mia carriera che quando si diventa famosi si perde il diritto alla privacy e lo stesso accade ai tuoi figli se permetti che le loro foto finiscano sui giornali i paparazzi possono seguirmi fotografarmi possono fare quello che vogliono ma non devono scattare foto ai miei figli
979361 shiloh e zahara si offrono di darmi una mano quando devo cambiare i vestiti ai fratelli tenendoli e prendendo i vestiti sono dolcissime sembrano piccole mammine

979398 sdb is a treatable but markedly underdiagnosed condition of frequent breathing pauses during sleep
979399 sdb is linked to incident cardiovascular disease stroke and other morbidity however the risk of mortality with untreated sdb determined by polysomnography screening in the general population has not been established
979400 our findings of a significant high mortality risk with untreated sdb independent of age sex and bmi underscore the need for heightened clinical recognition and treatment of sdb indicated by frequent episodes of apnea and hypopnea irrespective of symptoms of sleepiness
979401 although further studies are needed to quantify the proportion of mortality that could be lowered by prevention or treatment of sdb the results of our study can be applied directly to current healthcare practice

979426 when you agreed with the conclusion why is it now such a big deal
979427 i feel like the main reason people are turning to vinyl is because digital downloading and mp3s are kind of killing the cd
979428 for music nerds like me people who actually still want to go buy music vinyl is becoming the format of choice if you are against just downloading if you still want the artwork and if you want something tangible i think its the superior format
979429 brad pope swears by cds because he was raised with lps
979430 he feels that cds are way superior because they dont wear down or anything like that
979431 i think the way that i discovered the difference between cds and records was becoming obsessed with the beatles and learning the entire beatles catalog on cd then i started collecting their old lps from back in the day and playing those you can really hear the difference
979432 nowadays it is becoming the standard to have a record player with a usb connection to rip your lps to your itunes or whatever other program
979433 also a lot of indie records come with a free digital download of the purchased album which is a major incentive because everybody has an ipod now the people who want to dork it up in their rooms with their records can still dork it up in their cars with their ipods too which is such a cool incentive i think buying a record combined with that option beats the crap out of a cd

979440 as we now have developed treatments that are easier to take in terms of number of pills number of doses in the day and potential adverse effects and we now know there seem to be additional benefits with starting earlier the pendulum is swinging back to starting treatment earlier
979441 also importantly is the recognition of comorbidities that should prompt you to start treatment earlier including hepatitis b or c cardiovascular risk and hiv associated necropathy
979442 the take home message is prevention is always better than treatment which seems to be possible through the utilization of the latest diagnostic techniques
979443 the results of this trial show that telemedicine is efficacious for making acute medical decisions stroke telemedicine is widely implemented and discussed but despite its dissemination its efficacy has not previously been shown our results support the use of telemedicine to make urgent treatment decisions such as whether to use thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke

979447 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni

979455 it is inappropriate for the scheme to select as standard such a confusing commercial deal when it is geared to encourage vulnerable customers to opt for a potentially confusing or costly installation
979456 the help scheme should not open the floodgates for marketing practices and advertising of additional products or services to older and disabled consumers which can leave them stressed and confused

979482 we started out in paris where jon brion inspired us to create first and think later
979483 we took the night train to berlin where everything came together in an avalanche of experimentation that took us all by surprise where we made a pact with stuart price to ignore the rules of good taste where we were hypnotised by marlene dietrich and spent many a long night throwing ideas around in the crumbling cabaret esque glamour of our favourite bar

979531 the press gave mccain a lot of credit for saying the swiftboating should stop i thought it ringed hollow for a simple reason when bush cheney let the swiftboating continue a real maverick would have refused to campaign for these thugs but what did mccain do he campaigned for them enthusiastically something about actions speaking louder than words

979538 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
979539 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
979540 i came to realise how much we take at face value
979541 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
979542 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
979543 obviously it isnt perfectly flat thanks to geological phenomena like hills and valleys it is around 24 900 miles in diameter
979544 sheer incredulity to the conviction that its all just an elaborate joke
979545 without a platform for communication a head count is almost impossible

979547 the space agencies of the world are involved in an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit
979548 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
979549 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
979550 as a rule of thumb we dont have any fears of aircraft or other modes of transportation
979551 flat earth theory is one of the ultimate conspiracy theories
979552 naturally flat earth believers think that the moon landings were faked as were the photographs of earth from space
979553 it is always good to question how we know what we know but it is also good to have the ability to accept compelling evidence such as the photographs of earth from space

979628 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
979629 this challenges the popular belief that thieves target large businesses because they accept more payment card transactions
979630 small businesses are targeted much more often the proprietor of a corner store is unlikely to have it experience and few resources to buy and maintain various data security controls
979631 most surprising for me was the high proportion of card present compromises
979632 that could be anything from someone double swiping the card or using a scanner to vulnerabilities in the payment applications
979633 if a hacker is able to exploit a particular pos system by using the default log in credentials for example they can easily use the same exploit against other merchants using the same device and configuration
979634 the most common problem we encounter is that the merchant or application vendor has stored data they should not hold
979635 in many cases the retailer is not even aware that a credit card number has been stored in an application they are running
979636 retailers at that level will however switch banks to save a few dollars on transaction fees so if one bank threatens them with a fine theyll simply change to another bank
979637 on the other hand banks are obliged to keep their networks secure its a difficult position to be in
979638 the terminals are supposed to obfuscate credit card numbers when you swipe the card and the ticket prints out you should only see the first six and the last four digits with xxxxs in the middle
979639 if the receipt was lost or someone broke in and stole old receipts they would be unable to read the card number
979640 and theyre likely to be using a cheap hosting service and insecure off the shelf online shopping systems
979641 in one instance the bank had shut down its e commerce systems and couldnt trade until it made its systems secure
979642 people are focused on protecting the perimeter with firewalls and intrusion detection systems but the issue is that hackers are somehow able to get through
979643 firewalls also fail to stop insiders who suddenly decide to steal information its not just card data its employee medical information salary details and increasingly customer information that has been outsourced for processing
979644 if a company is able to encrypt sensitive data the problem goes away even if your system is breached if the data is encrypted the hackers get nothing
979645 a lot of this is appliance driven so it just comes down to normal it management
979646 youre actually embedding encryption in your web and application servers
979647 right now database administrators are able to look at any column of data such as salaries the technology now lets you encrypt that column only so that the database administrators and software programmers cant look at it and if intruders do get in they cant see it either

979660 when the history of the bush administrations executive aggrandizement campaign is finally written a very large and important part of that story a central theme in jane mayers new book for instance is just how many very strongly conservative republicans resisted the cheney addington gonzales rove agenda

979677 its amazing that the u s presidential campaign can go on for two freaking years and by the end its still hard to tell what the candidates really believe how much they really know and what theyd do once in office
979678 its really not that hard to find out both candidates have websites which give their stands on issues
979679 however youre going to find out very little about their stands by reading the mainstream press or watching tv news talk the generation that still gets their information that way is going to be woefully underinformed i have absorbed far more information about where the candidates both of them stand by reading lefty blogs cant speak for righty blogs for all the bit and bull about how newspapers report and blogs just give opinions i find it to be just the opposite with respect to the candidates positions on issues during a campaign

979799 it is quite spacious and well appointed but i am not sure luxurious is the right word
979800 i think it will be less spacious once it is cluttered up with journalists they have a canteen and that was ok but it wasnt exactly caviar on toast i think if the food is good the journalists there will be grateful because they will be stuck in there for so long its not like you can step out and go to a restaurant instead there is so much security around the perimeter

979805 in thyolo district malawi one nurse keeps 400 patients alive by following up their essential treatment but her basic salary amounts to just 3 a day
979806 it is intolerable to then be told by governments and donor countries that it is unsustainable to raise her wages even though she is responsible for 7 500 worth of drugs a month for her patients those willing to support funding for medicines must find ways to cover recurrent costs like salaries for health workers

979818 in this business its a lot because the turbines operate all the time and after a while the advantages really build up
979819 a gorlov turbine could be airlifted into a remote community which is located near a river
979820 if you put the turbine in the river it gives the community the chance to generate enough power to meet many of its current needs as well as generate more power to increase income
979821 because this is a product that will be used in remote locations its extremely important that it be reliable
979822 the design well have for mass production will be aluminum and we plan to have a design that can be put together with common tools so you can install it in remote locations
979823 but how many people here have seen it in september when the current has slowed to almost nothing what happens in that situation to something like the gorlov turbine
979824 but even if there was a crash program it would probably take us at least 10 years to get there
979825 right now the big thing about energy is theres a difference between what is generated in one place and what is demanded in another and the grid is what transfers that energy
979826 when a power generating plant makes too much energy for the demand a whole lot of it leaks out in terms of heat in transformers and all kinds of things when theres too great a demand people get brownouts
979827 theres no reason why the grid cant be provided with these decentralized generators like the one jim sysko is using in maine there could be millions of them powering the system reducing the demand for more natural gas and fossil fuels which is the whole issue
979828 with the airplane industry if it werent for the federal subsidies wed never be able to fly like we fly today
979829 a big plus to the turbine is that it doesnt need a dam
979830 there are 55 000 sluiceways artificial channels into which water is let by a sluice in the us where these turbines could be put to use now
979831 remember weve got this concentrated version of energy that just flows by us every day nature doesnt waste anything

979962 after the show wrapped up salman went up to ranbir hugged him and presented him with a portrait of raj kapoor people who saw it were very impressed it was an exact impression of raj kapoor in profile salman must have seen photographs and painted him ranbir was so touched that he had tears in his eyes and hugged salman
979963 after the show ended ranbir showed it to his grandmother krishna for whom it was an extremely emotional moment she has hung up the portrait on a wall of the rk studios office
