5280000 attacking other big stacks can be a very strong tactic as they will not want to get involved even sometimes with a very big hand as they are reluctant to give up their strong position look for opportunities to come over the top of raises particularly from late position it is a stronger looking bet puts more pressure on and gains more chips than first raise you will be believed for a hand most of the time
5280001 short stacked players often will raise pre flop hoping no one calls gold 2006 wsop main event would fire back and bully them off their hand probably at times with inferior cards gold knew his opponents would call or re raise only if they had a real hand so when they played back at him hed usually just fold
5280002 i want to win about 4 000 more chips by the time the antes come into play
5280003 when youre a big stack and against opponents who have stacks large enough to pay you well if you hit but small enough not to be a major threat to you many hands are worth limping im talking medium off suit two gappers suited kings and queens sometimes even baby aces when your opponent has about 1 3 to 1 2 your chips and a limp costs you less than 5 theres that 5 10 rule again of your stack calling the blind is a no brainer
5280004 you do not make calls just because you can afford to do so rather youd either have a chance of making a hand or plan to steal the pot from your opponent in a later betting round specifically you want to make moves that will slowly drain your opponents chip stack but never do you want to double them up
5280005 if you do want to use the leverage offered by a big chip stack target the players who appear to be playing too tight and put pressure on them with bets and raises theyll be all too aware of the fact your big stack could knock them out at any time
5280006 as this change in the breeding world took place the sport was allowing the use of pain killers and other medications that are forbidden in most other countries they allow infirm horses to achieve success go to stud and pass on their infirmities to the next
5280007 a las vegas style night of entertainment for young adults
5280008 the evening which featured illusionist mord maman started with an escapology show that is the brainchild of rabbi shlomo farhi who weaves ideas of jewish wisdom into proceedings
5280009 o god who on the holy mount revealed to chosen witnesses your well beloved son wonderfully transfigured in raiment white and glistening mercifully grant that we being delivered from the disquietude of this world may by faith behold the king in his beauty who with you o father and you o holy spirit lives and reigns one god for ever and ever
5280010 do we expect not to let people score i think thats the mentality we come in with we have three pitchers you go back to their college days they didnt like to allow runs if a run scores we re not going to be happy
5280011 he told me that right after the second inning that i was only going to go three
5280012 i dont mind whatever we have to do to get all of us work
5280013 you can relax its just more fun to see our offense produce that way its not every day you get to see so many home runs and people running the bases
5280014 not only pakistan we are getting students enquiries from sri lanka china bangladesh and the middle east some of the students in countries have already enrolled online and have started using various free tests
5280015 we are expecting a huge response from pakistan since nowhere in the world you will find such a huge number of tests available for different exams free of cost
5280016 there cant be a better method through which a student can improve his grades by doing these practice tests religiously the students are able to analyze themselves as to where they stand and thereby work on their grey areas
5280017 i have to say before i went to the seminar i didnt really care about recycling
5280018 now i see how important it is that we recycle and i want to make sure people are recycling
5280019 genocide interests me because its an issue that we as a civilization can really change people shouldnt have to suffer because of the ethnic group that they belong to
5280020 top scholars and policy practitioners together to speak with a select generation of future leaders interested in americas role in the world
5280021 she was highly recommended by one of her teachers and she submitted an impressive essay that highlighted the importance of raising awareness of genocide as a worldwide issue
5280022 most of us at the seminar didnt really know the issues facing the world today
5280023 it was really eye opening everybody there had a deep concern for world issues and everybody there took back the idea that they wanted to change to world
5280024 some of the most interesting and funniest people i know are teachers particularly social studies teachers
5280025 i would say that teammates are your best friends in life

5280032 im hoping people come out of here thinking about not using so many plastic bags in the first place
5280033 and they walk out of here with a lifetime skill were incorporating and doing things in a green way intentionally and hope that those ideas and habits gets passed on
5280034 everybody who comes to these classes has been saving things and not sure what to do with them
5280035 but they know things are precious and can be used
5280036 im very interested in the history of things things that have existed in time
5280037 something emanates from artwork made from things that already have a past history a life intentions behind its initial creation
5280038 i wasnt thinking of it nearly so much in terms of environmental issues at that point
5280039 but because of where i started its been very easy to see the transition to other reasons for doing it there just seems to be good reason to get as many uses as you can get out of something rather than throwing it into the dump
5280040 in art school people were doing stuff with reclaimed things but the concept of recycling was small
5280041 the whole renewable energy conservation thing has become mainstream lately its about time it seems like it has taken forever
5280042 our materials are like beautiful relics that have been abandoned
5280043 its eye opening to notice something discarded and then see its instant beauty history the life in it
5280044 one can get neurotic about balancing the consumptive aspect with the final product
5280045 you can get neurotic about asking if its right if its environmentally conscious
5280046 we both need art in our lives both making it and being around it
5280047 yes theres the consumption and the collecting but we tend to be frugal anyway from years of being starving artists
5280048 for most artists its about getting materials we cant get otherwise
5280049 we work on a limited budget so the first notion is hey someones going to be able to use it so lets hold onto it
5280050 theres that thrifty quality but the longer you do it the more you see how that thriftiness is appropriate in light of other things other reasons like the problems with landfills
5280051 theres one aspect thats really specific about the environment in that its going to reuse material but then theres another aspect that involves a fused glass piece that will be made in germany which means i would be flying to germany and theres a huge carbon footprint with that
5280052 i dont see it as conflict except in a healthy way
5280053 its humorous in some ways its good to keep a healthy perspective and not be so self righteous
5280054 thinking about plastic bags as becoming such an integral part of our lifestyle and how we can reassign the value of those bags
5280055 ive used them in three major installations and two smaller works but i dont think ive depleted their usefulness
5280056 they dont degrade and from what ive read they will eventually break up into small particles but never leave the environment
5280057 i try to bring a sense of playfulness to my work
5280058 i want to take a mundane object like a plastic bag and elevate it
5280059 were finding that a lot of kids are very enthusiastic about the program and once they know a little bit about recycling theyre really happy to go to their parents and tell them all about recycling when they get home
5280060 microsoft is assuming some risk with the ultimate program by having unlimited support calls as part of the deal when you buy proactive services but microsoft also walks in the door knowing the history of that customer what theyve deployed the relative health overall and number of incidents per year
5280061 the exchange assessment service costs around 35 000 to 50 000 but you get high business value for those dollars and we have many other examples of that

5280076 i once received a letter from an old lady in california who informed me that when the tired reader comes home at night he wishes to read something that will lift his heart and it seems her heart had not been lifted up by anything of mine she had read i think that if her heart had been in the right place it would have been lifted up
5280077 my subject in fiction is the action of grace in territory held largely by the devil
5280078 t o the hard of hearing you shout and for the almost blind you draw large and startling figures
5280079 ive been believing in nothing since before you were born
5280080 to insure our sense of mystery we need a sense of evil which sees the devil as a real spirit who must be made to name himself and not simply to name as vague evil but to name himself with his specific personality for every occasion
5280081 our age not only does not have a very sharp eye for the almost imperceptible intrusions of grace it no longer has much feeling the nature of the violences which precede and follow them the devils greatest wile baudelaire has said is to convince us that he does not exist
5280082 made its first foray into presidential politics with the presciently named indecision 2000 and the difference in the shows approach to its coverage then and now provides a tongue in cheek measure of the shows striking evolution
5280083 all the days events at least the ones were allowed into
5280084 the daily show news scraper 117 stories 73 situation rooms 26 news tickers
5280085 you all the news stories first before its even true
5280086 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5280087 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about
5280088 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to mask or repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
5280089 those types of stories that can almost like the guy in the green mile
5280090 suck in all the toxins and allow you to do something with it that is palatable
5280091 most agitated feelings about torture in a way that is not to be too cute that is not torture to listen to and that is not purely strident
5280092 the rubber face theres only so many ways you can stare incredulously at the camera and tilt an eyebrow but thats your old standby what would
5280093 the absurdity of what you imagine to be the dark heart of conspiracy theorists wet dreams far too frequently turns out to be true
5280094 you go i know what ill do ill create a character who when hiring people to rebuild the nation we invaded says the only question ill ask is what do you think of roe v wade itll be hilarious then you read that book about the green zone in iraq
5280095 and you go oh they did that i mean how do you take things to the next level
5280096 as a comedian as a person as a citizen as a mammal
5280097 being conducted on the scale that bush conducted things or even the clintons i dont think it has the same true viciousness and contempt
5280098 to name things that dont seem to have a name
5280099 named after something that no matter how long you head towards it you never quite reach it
5280100 time it takes lenscrafters to make you a pair of bifocals
5280101 may be exaggerated on the show its grounded in the way jon really feels
5280102 all these data points of spin and transparent falsehoods dished out in the form of political discourse
5280103 fish from that what is the true meaning what are red herrings false leads
5280104 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery
5280105 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
5280106 for ourselves so that we can drain whatever abscess there is in our hearts so we can move on to the business of making you laugh
5280107 sit in the back of the country and make wisecracks
5280108 the process of the show is to bury those feelings as subtext and that was a real moment of text its laying bare the type of thing that is there hopefully to inform the show but the show is usually an exercise in hiding that
5280109 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
5280110 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
5280111 from his background he has a deep understanding of what american families face
5280112 you know like saying serbia is a sandwich ingredient or because of his uncanny physical resemblance to the michelin man
5280113 the set is outside but air conditioning vents make the weather bearable
5280114 the first couple of nights even with the air conditioning it was steamy in here but weve been lucky ever since
5280115 its been overcast some days takes the temperature down we call it fog smog
5280116 off of the top perch where its been sitting for the past four weeks

5280130 in one complaint a grandmother from vienna accused the ad of contributing to the moral decline of society by exposing children to such imagery the grandmother was motivated to make the complaint after a visit by her grandson turned sour

5280137 human rights violations in prayer camps and access to mental health in ghana
5280138 we are aware that you are all waiting for the mental health bill
5280139 mentally ill persons are always in a world of their own and they dont care about others they are not violent
5280140 few people want to train to take up a position in the mental health sector because of the stigma attached to the job those who do train tend to move abroad to work for better pay and opportunities
5280141 powerful and pervasive stigma prevents people from acknowledging their own mental health problems much less disclosing them to others
5280142 i am just so happy to be playing and be in a position to contribute i will play safety and linebacker plus some special teams i hope
5280143 i definitely consider myself to be a safety that is where i have played my whole life however when the linebackers and safeties meet at the same time i am in the linebackers meeting
5280144 we are aggressive as ever its not like we were trying to be laid back and relaxed before but now we have the green light to make as many plays as we can we have assignments and have no room to be reckless but we can run so we fly all over the field it should be fun
5280145 i cant pick up stupid penalties but i play with great heart and passion it is not even like i have to try to play that way it is just the natural way to play for me
5280146 i can play with my hand down if i need to or i can play standing up wherever the team needs me to play is where i will play i love the fact that we will be thinking less and just letting our athletic ability shine

5280156 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5280157 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5280158 in hindsight i played perfectly into the hands of monckton and his happy radio host roy green who share the same goal not to win an argument about global warming science but merely to show that there still is an argument
5280159 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5280160 so little was known about him during the first five years of the war
5280161 he really cared for the poor people in the village
5280162 he used to share his food with them and tell us we shouldnt exploit them
5280163 from my childhood i came to feel the meaning of poverty and inhuman exploitation
5280164 she saw me wearing them and she was like you know those are drews i dont care he broke them in and they fit me perfectly
5280165 it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
5280166 there are some things i still want to do to raise the bar a bit more in the world of swimming for me its still work in progress
5280167 i think the industry is going through a paradigm change and its not just north american companies its all companies
5280168 the economy worldwide is kind of in crisis demographics are changing and birth rates are declining so is it easy out there no it isnt is it getting harder yes it is but if a lot of groups are not going to survive the paradigm shift hopefully well be one of those that do
5280169 i think if you draw parallels with the movie industry youll see a lot of mergers and acquisitions that took place as it was forming in the 20s and 30s which resulted in the six major studios that are still around today that seems to be happening in our industry so mergers and acquisitions are going to continue and theres nothing that can stop it its all about making the economics work

5280219 weve been gradually realizing customers who consumer more proactive services are happier and healthier and require less reactive services with their charge models
5280220 many customers have complained about the hourly or incident support models that premier has used before because its difficult to forecast the need for reactive break fix tech support and a challenge if a customer uses up all the hours incidents and has to buy more

5280232 despite strenuous efforts by some trainers ngos and some universities schools do not focus on teaching academic language competence and even proficiency and fluency in english which is the main language of teaching and learning

5280329 he described the 250 000 child abuse images as his collection he was prepared to share that with acquaintances he found on his forum
5280330 this site would have existed without him but it would not have been operating as effectively
5280331 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals both in this country and elsewhere
5280332 this was an extremely sensitive and highly complex investigation requiring excellent teamwork between cleveland police the child exploitation online protection ceop centre and the metropolitan police service along with other police forces in the uk

5280338 the defendants role was to police the website which gave him the opportunity to transfer these images to his computer
5280339 the evidence recovered from his computer showed he had amassed a vast collection of indecent photographs of children
5280340 it appeared the defendant kept some of the most serious images to use as trading chips
5280341 the crown would say that this collection of indecent photographs and the subsequent police investigation revealed that this defendant has been involved in the distribution of these photographs for the last four or five years

5280520 out of the 120 000 students who enrolled in higher education in 2000 36 000 30 percent dropped out in their first year of study and 24 000 more 20 percent dropped out during the second and third years
5280521 these figures form the backdrop in which teaching and learning programmes have to plan their strategies and interventions there are several other factors that should be considered
5280522 they carry the hope of family and community enter a new challenging environment with very little orientation and are faced with the demand that they adjust or fail
5280523 despite strenuous efforts by some trainers ngos and some universities schools do not focus on teaching academic language competence and even proficiency and fluency in english which is the main language of teaching and learning
5280524 some universities are exploring a four year degree structure and rethinking their courses in exciting ways the first response therefore is support in a context ready to consider and accept change

5280569 implementation of long term strategies including public education and deer population management is proving effective as we continue to see reductions in some of the negative impacts of deer in the county
5280570 deer vehicle collisions are one important barometer in monitoring the deer management programs effectiveness
5280571 other indications that were seeing measurable success in managing deer in the county include significantly lower deer numbers in county and state parks in which population management has been conducted in recent years and an increase in community participation in combating deer impacts to home landscaping and agricultural crops
5280572 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5280573 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile programme have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5280574 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5280575 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5280576 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future
5280577 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged

5280592 youve got to ask the question can china sustain its strong growth and will commodity demand for iron ore and coal hold up if all of chinas customers are likely to cool down next year
5280593 the biggest issue for australia is what happens to bulk commodity prices and whether contract prices come up next year
5280594 the amount of material you have to deliver is exponentially increased with this cumulative growth
5280595 if the experience of the last two decades has taught us anything it is that the situation never really returns to normal even when we see the outward symptoms of peace we miss the alienation and resentment within no matter what we do things never get better for very long
5280596 i reckon we should hold a referendum in the valley let the kashmiris determine their own destiny if they want to stay in india they are welcome but if they dont then we have no moral right to force them to remain if they vote for integration with pakistan all this will mean is that azad kashmir will gain a little more territory if they opt for independence they will last for about 15 minutes without the billions that india has showered on them but it will be their decision
5280597 whatever happens how can india lose if you believe in democracy then giving kashmiris the right to self determination is the correct thing to do and even if you dont surely we will be better off being rid of this constant painful strain on our resources our lives and our honour as a nation this is indias century we have the world to conquer the other and the means to do it kashmir is a 20th century problem we cannot let it drag us down and bleed us as we assume our rightful place in the world its time to think the unthinkable
5280598 i was once hopeful of kashmirs integration but after six decades of effort kashmiri alienation looks greater than ever india seeks to integrate with kashmir not rule it colonially yet the parallels between british rule in india and indian rule in kashmir have become too close for my comfort
5280599 we promised kashmiris a plebiscite six decades ago let us hold one now and give them three choices independence union with pakistan and union with india almost certainly the valley will opt for independence jammu will opt to stay with india and probably ladakh too let kashmiris decide the outcome not the politicians and armies of india and pakistan

5280630 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness

5280645 we looked up and it looked like lots of confetti falling out of the sky
5280646 a twin engined plane then came toward us falling all the time it was going to hit us or could have gone onto the housing estate
5280647 but i think the pilot must have realised what was going to happen because the plane then banked very very sharply like they do in those acrobatic displays
5280648 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway

5280691 there is only one problem movies are not music tracks and movie consumers are not music consumers people buy music and rent movies yes some people will buy a dvd of a movie classic or of a movie they particularly like however it is the exception rather than the rule very few consumers other than fanatical movie buffs keep vast collections of dvds loaded with their favourite movies perhaps jobs thinks he can turn movie renters into movie buyers simply by offering downloads on itunes but its a pipe dream theres only so many times you can watch spiderman and if its not on cable this month you can rent it from blockbuster

5280730 lgh must ensure the design of the new hospital incorporates the physical space required for the delivery of primary health care
5280731 it must immediately develop and implement a strategy that will position it to have a primary health care team in place to coincide with the opening of the new hospital
5280732 a hard and fast rule simply does not ensure the safe operation of fire pits in every case
5280733 each request should be investigated and a permit issued for the safest area whether it be the front the side or the back of the house

5280738 this is a fairly big project and its very important to the people that live there so we wanted to give them the opportunity to voice their concerns if there were any
5280739 they do have some concerns about that project moving forward
5280740 the people of the neighbourhood dont want this to be a case of a silver cloud with a dark lining
5280741 for years people on both those streets have been plagued with sewage backups in their basements and this has happened to multiple houses at once there is no doubt in my mind the current sewage infrastructure is seriously defective just to imagine and consider another 80 households tapping into that same system of course has to set off alarm bells to homeowners in the area
5280742 some people have not even reported the incidents to the town or their insurance companies
5280743 and that is understandable when you consider the repercussions the town has never taken any solid responsibility in the form of action on this nor have they even publicly admitted there is a problem people fear their insurance rates will rise due to claims and repeated claims and there are people who are embarrassed by this and dont want it known surely we can understand that who wants to tell there is a foot or so of raw sewage in their basements what does that information do to the value of those homes we heard some interesting accounts at that meeting last week and problems that were experienced as far back as the 1960s
5280744 there has been a problem there in the past in that particular area
5280745 theres been nothing formally reported there in the last couple years but there were a couple of blockages we found the source of the blockage but we havent determined if there are other problems there
5280746 it only makes sense for the developers sake as much for the current residents to finally do this
5280747 we have to remember this development didnt create the problem the problem has long been in existence but this development will and has to put an added volume of pressure on that already undependable system i have no qualms in saying i dont believe for a minute that system can take that extra load simply because it cant take whats already on it the onus is on the town to provide the sewage service to the property owners we all pay taxes and should have the same convenience everyone else in this town enjoys and deserves
5280748 this is another example of a problem that is already there and the added influx of residents in the new complex will add to
5280749 there is no need to wait for a fatality to realize there is a need for this safety component in a growing town
5280750 we need an assessment on the whole town to see if we need more street lights and traffic control
5280751 the students there at get off and on the bus from the street as opposed to the school parking lot
5280752 there seemed be a solid consensus amongst everyone at the meeting this was an unnecessary hazard and can be easily rectified there are about 36 students attending that school and six full size school buses line off bristol cres in order to transport them there was some concern of access to the fire hydrant in that area as well i understood from the meeting that is something already being looked at therefore it didnt require a big lot of discussion
5280753 i think a number of people voiced their concerns on this at the forum because they have fears it will become a bunkhouse type accommodation for transient workers coming and going
5280754 when it was identified that ioc would be the leasing client the history of bunkhouse days came flooding back i guess people would like to see family type occupants rather than fly by night workers that have no roots or intention of putting down roots here
5280755 we cant say to ioc who they should put in there and who they shouldnt
5280756 the application before us is for an 80 unit apartment building and thats what we will base our decision on representatives at the meeting said it was for families and family units they want a place to house their employees if someone doesnt believe that we cant help that
5280757 i am very happy with the reception the town gave us homeowners and how they provided a open forum to discuss our concerns
5280758 i certainly appreciated the mayors assurance and i do now have faith that everything will be followed through in a prompt and effectual manner personally i think this apartment complex has the potential to add a great deal to our neighbourhood and if the proper measures are taken i see no reason why both developers and the current residents of that area all cant be happy with the end result the key to resolving any problems is people coming forth with their concerns and having the right people available to listen that happened last monday night and i salute everyone who attended that meeting
5280759 the negotiations will continue under the facilitation of south african president thabo mbeki is the mediator for the zanu pf that a deal will be concluded in the fullness of time so that we can put behind us the divisions conflict the polarisation that in fact has divided our country

5280781 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice
5280782 some of the people sentenced yesterday only met their lawyers for the first time during the trial while several said they suffered torture when they were held incommunicado and that they were forced to confess to crimes
5280783 those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system how is that justice
5280784 marks of ill treatment were still clearly visible on their bodies
5280785 the sudanese government has the duty to investigate crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice but they must do it in accordance to international law and their own constitution which guarantees fair trials
5280786 we urge the sudanese authorities not to execute these men and to review their cases immediately according to sudans laws
5280787 alexander solzhenitsyn the russian author who spent many years in the gulag of siberia bears witness to the power of the cross after long suffering in the work camp of siberia he fell into despair like other prisoners he had worked in the fields day after day in rain and sun during summer and winter his days were filled with backbreaking labor and slow starvation on a particular day the hopelessness of his situation became too much he saw no reason to continue living to continue fighting the system he thought that the rest of his life was meaningless since he would most likely die in this siberian prison his life made no difference in the world so he gave up laying his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude work site bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to many other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he lifted his eyes and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down next to him the man said nothing instead he drew a stick through the ground at solzhenitsyns feet tracing the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the sign of the cross his entire perspective changed he knew that he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet in that moment he knew that there was something greater than the evil that he saw in the prison something greater than the soviet union he knew that the hope of all mankind was represented in that simple cross and through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly got up picked up his shovel and went back to work nothing outward had changed but inside he received hope

5280816 sister since we are unlikely to make it out of here alive would you do something for me
5280817 i have never seen a womans breasts and i was wondering if i might see yours
5280818 well under the circumstances i dont see that it would do any harm
5280819 i have never seen a mans penis could i see yours
5280820 sister you know that if i insert my penis in the right place it can give life
5280821 people need to communicate and be entertained they dont need to compute
5280822 well id like to have an iphone or whatever that could do all of that but i couldnt imagine giving up my main pc
5280823 little interest in leading a price cutting competition but also little choice but to join it
5280824 we cant afford to worry about how this might impact any existing notebook pc business were committed because this could well grow into an enormous market and we cant survive future competition unless we grab a piece of it now
5280825 if the operating system os doesnt need to emphasize business use linux is a good choice because its graphical user interface gui software is quite mature retailers and contract manufacturers in taiwan say that novice pc users there like students and housewives tend to buy the linux version of the eee pc701 while geeks go for windows xp the linux version comes with a launcher providing pre installed applications web services and other features at a click the design was probably adopted to make the system even easier to use
5280826 we have avoided taking this step as long as possible
5280827 the performance from our players wasnt good enough from one to 11
5280828 i thought the players would be brimming with confidence and looking to turn it on for the fans but we never got going
5280829 everyone is saying we are going to be relegation favourites which is fair enough but i think theres a great belief in the lads that we can do a lot better than that and do a bristol city
5280830 they were no great shakes when we were in the same division
5280831 these two players are very good it shows our ambition the gaffer and chairman have been trying to get players in for a few weeks and been saying they want three or so players before the end of the transfer window
5280832 if we can get that calibre of player into the club then it can only help the club go forward and settle itself in the premier league
5280833 we are close to doing something with robbie hes been different class in training in the last few days
5280834 celtic thomas gravesen and thomass representatives have agreed that he will part company with the club
5280835 thomas wishes celtic every success and likewise the club wishes thomas all the very best for the future
5280836 i wasnt at ibrox or parkhead last week so thats how far those rumours went
5280837 its hard to tell but at the minute im there unless im told otherwise
5280838 to be perfectly honest i wouldnt entertain a move to glasgow
5280839 if you make a mistake people remember it whereas a striker can miss 10 chances and nobody notices
5280840 were all flat chested otherwise we wouldnt need to be feminists
5280841 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
5280842 i havent sold 25 million books but ive been selling some books lately
5280843 we go to arsenal in our next away game and if we could go there and play the same way we might get something there as well
5280844 the key is getting a good result from the dice
5280845 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5280846 your source is a liar the information you have is absolutely untrue
5280847 when my husband is getting ready for bed i get undressed lay on the bed and put both legs behind my head when he comes out and sees me like that he gets so excited we have wild sex the rest of the night
5280848 i want to auction my silver medal and give the money to sichuan province to help them so that this medal can fulfill its value
5280849 we pay nearly 1 000 pounds 1 860 dollars rent to have a stall here and if we cant attract customers particularly in winter then im worried the stall might not survive
5280850 the yells of the market have been part of life in hexham for anyone who lives in the town and its always been that way
5280851 the hustle and bustle of the market place is one of the reasons people visit the town its part of its charm
5280852 we talked to the traders about this on a number of occasions before sending them a letter which is not asking them to stop calling but to reduce the volume and frequency
5280853 a total of 49 deaths corresponding to 1 18 per cent mortality among the enrolled patients were recorded during the studies
5280854 i wanted to get factual information on such trials so we can press the government to formulate some specific policy to regulate it
5280855 no studies selectively target children belonging to low socioeconomic status
5280856 the dollar has come off because investors have realized that it has moved too far too fast at some point you would expect a pause
5280857 it would take a significant souring of the u s economic outlook to take the dollar down the perception on the dollar has changed and what you are seeing is a pullback in what is essentially a bull market
5280858 the dollar seemed to overshoot the macro adjustments last week with the massive liquidation in the commodity markets
5280859 but we are seeing some signs of stability there and second thoughts about how far oil will fall is allowing the dollar to take a breather
5280860 the increase cannot keep pace with population growth more people means more waste its that simple
5280861 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of
5280862 they do blaspheme who say allah is christ the son of mary
5280863 taste ye then for ye forgot the meeting of this day of yours
5280864 he is the first and the last the evident and the hidden and he has full knowledge of all things
5280865 and verily unto us belong the end and the beginning
5280866 but it is to allah that the end and the beginning of all things belong
5280867 i will always breath for as long as i live
5280868 and there are certainly among the people of the book jews and christians those who believe in god in the revelation to you and in the revelation to them bowing in humility to god they will not sell the signs of god for a miserable gain
5280869 not all of them are alike of the people of the book jews and christians are a portion that stand for the right they rehearse the signs of god all night long and they prostrate themselves in adoration
5280870 those who believe in the quran and those who follow the jewish scriptures and the christians and the sabians any who believe in god and the last day and work righteousness shall have their reward with their lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
5280871 nay whoever submits his whole self to god and is a doer of good he will get his reward with his lord on such shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
5280872 those who believe and do deeds of righteousness and establish regular prayers and regular charity will have their reward with their lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
5280873 strongest among men in enmity to the believers muslims wilt thou find the jews and pagans and nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say we are christians because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world and they are not arrogant
5280874 remains confident that antitrust issues will not prevent or delay a transaction
5280875 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5280876 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5280877 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5280878 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5280879 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5280880 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5280881 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5280882 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5280883 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5280884 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5280885 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5280886 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5280887 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5280888 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5280889 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5280890 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a
5280891 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think

5280894 zenit asked for 25million 19 7million for the transfer of arshavin this is the last price of the team
5280895 four days ago in a private meeting with one of the tottenham representatives it was take it or leave it that is the last price
5280896 i have got to talk with president of zenit alexander dukov if he wants to buy somebody he needs to sell somebody so he is pushing for zenit himself to sell andrei as he understands the contribution of the player
5280897 we still have a lot of time and from my experience a lot of deals are finalised close to the end of the window so we will see
5280898 digital storage in consumer electronics 2008 report to their offering
5280899 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5280900 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5280901 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5280902 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5280903 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5280904 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5280905 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5280906 we in fact tried to stop the brawl but police would not listen to us
5280907 tissue engineering is an exciting field were creating solutions to problems that can significantly impact peoples quality of life
5280908 these gels have great promise in not only regenerating bone but serving as a gene therapy delivery system
5280909 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5280910 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5280911 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5280912 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5280913 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5280914 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5280915 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world
5280916 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium
5280917 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5280918 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5280919 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5280920 hace menos de un mes el presidente habl y dijo que s lo se iban a continuar las obras que tuvieran m s del 75 de ejecuci n y ahora de pronto 21 d as despu s nos presenta una retah la de obras p blicas incluso fantasiosas

5280922 measured by enrollment lower costs than originally expected and persistently high satisfaction rates the part d drug benefit program has in a short time become a stable familiar and vital part of medicare
5280923 of course individual plans premiums and benefits may change given their past record of making smart choices i expect beneficiaries will continue to compare their plan options in the upcoming enrollment period based on cost coverage and convenience
5280924 average plan bids have increased at roughly the same rate as drug costs
5280925 beneficiary experience in part d continues to be good with millions of people getting the prescription drugs they need
5280926 cms will continue to provide up to date information about their plan benefits at http www medicare gov and 1 800 medicare 1 800 633 4227 and beneficiaries will receive their annual
5280927 clearly the nature of farm work carries more inherent risk than most other occupations these risks include use of heavy machinery the use of chemicals working in poor or dangerous weather conditions and working at heights
5280928 when it comes to agricultural machinery our message to the farming community is
5280929 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5280930 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5280931 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5280932 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5280933 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
5280934 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials
5280935 if an employer can manipulate or intimidate its employees into voting one way or another it seriously undermines political democracy
5280936 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
5280937 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
5280938 its a perfect opportunity both to celebrate the history of television and at the same time introduce new generations to some of the mediums most important events
5280939 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5280940 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5280941 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5280942 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5280943 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5280944 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5280945 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5280946 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans
5280947 through the generosity of our corporate members our chapters and the foundation itself we can offer this extensive group of scholarships to help fund these scholars as they pursue their education and develop their leadership skills the 2008 2009 scholarships offered by the himss foundation are foundation scholarships 5 000 cash awards healthcare information and management systems undergraduate healthcare information and management systems masters healthcare information and management systems phd richard p covert phd fhimss scholarship for management systems corporate supported scholarships beacon partners scholarship 7 000 cash award eclipsys clinical informatics scholarship 5 000 cash award ibm scholarship 7 000 cash award himss chapter supported scholarships 5 000 cash awards florida chapter scholarship southern amp central northern florida chapters the dvora brodie cphims fhimss new england chapter scholarship new york chapter scholarship northern california chapter scholarship southern california chapter scholarship denotes a new 2008 2009 scholarship scholarship recipients will receive an all expense paid trip to the 2009 annual himss conference and exhibition on april 4 8 2009 in chicago the recipients also will be honored at the 2009 himss awards and recognition banquet during the conference himss foundation scholarships and the online application form are available online application forms must be submitted online by oct 30 the himss foundation scholarship program provides an important investment in the next generation of leaders
5280948 the foundation appreciates these donations since the scholarship program supports our student members who represent the future of our industry
5280949 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial
5280950 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5280951 within the practice of creative improvisation there is no central director telling you what to do
5280952 instead each member engages in dialogue and risk taking the summer institute will explore this artistic form as a model for other types of interaction in communities
5280953 the two lecturers are both internationally respected scholars who are very stimulating and engaging speakers
5280954 we welcome any members of the public interested in coming to hear them speak
5280955 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5280956 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5280957 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5280958 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
5280959 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5280960 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5280961 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5280962 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown
5280963 these are the bacteria that maintain the earths health some of the methane escapes in some parts of the lake you can see the bubbles but whatever doesnt escape as bubbles these bacteria do a very good job of eating it
5280964 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
5280965 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5280966 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
5280967 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5280968 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
5280969 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
5280970 xenazine represents hope for patients and families dealing with this difficult disease
5280971 we are ecstatic that through the approval of xenazine patients and families will have the option to take the only drug developed specifically for treating the movements of huntingtons disease
5280972 chorea is a major cause of disability and death in patients with huntingtons disease
5280973 chorea is not just a mere inconvenience it can prevent huntingtons disease patients from walking talking working watching television and almost every aspect of ones life

5280990 to get the best throws you actually want a slight head wind
5280991 its completely counterintuitive the reason is this lift is determined by how quickly the air rushes by the discus with a headwind the air is rushing past the discus a bit faster than if it were going in the other direction
5280992 you know that if you put your hand outside a car while its moving you feel a force backward but if you tilt it theres some force upward thats lift the faster that wind is passing your hand the greater the lift

5280998 so all in all it seems to me that china is in a different situation now than in most of the other transition periods in its history the question is are the chinese leaders approaching this completely different situation in the completely different way that it requires that is no what we have in china is a mobile twenty first century society shackled to a sclerotic 1950s leninist style political system the economy is changing the society is changing but the politics are not and that is starting to cause sufficient problems in governance and even in the economy to call chinas rise to potential greatness into question china is more fragile and brittle than it appears

5281005 the launch of fusilev establishes the foundation of spectrums commercial oncology franchise
5281006 we believe the market potential of fusilev as a replacement for leucovorin could be significant in the u s there are more than 500 million milligrams of leucovorin prescribed every year our sales under the currently approved indications are expected to ramp up slowly until the full range of indications and formulations are approved we have built a team of highly seasoned sales and marketing professionals with a record of success in launching and marketing oncology drugs
5281007 based on the recommendation from nwn we looked very hard at netapp as the potential storage provider for burts bees
5281008 the closer we looked the more apparent the fit was sustainability is a very important factor for burts bees all throughout the organization including it since netapp is a storage vendor that is sustainable in its own right and provides a technology that puts the environment first it was the clear choice
5281009 netapp deduplication and flexible volumes gave us unprecedented storage savings for our virtualized environments providing us with exactly what we were looking for
5281010 we anticipate virtualizing all of our physical servers within the next year to help us grow sustainably and that wouldnt be possible with another storage platform and with the ability of netapp snapshot tm technology to easily mesh with vmware it provides us with peace of mind and a much better recovery point than with some of the other data protection solutions out there
5281011 customers like burts bees that experience tremendous growth year over year need a storage platform that not only addresses their critical storage needs today but also has the ability to scale with their growth
5281012 netapp does just that providing burts bees with a storage solution that addresses its expanding storage and data protection needs but without a constant requirement to add storage expansion and its associated power and cooling requirements netapp allows burts bees to focus on sustainable business and environmental practices

5281019 in this outstanding volume peter appleton and his colleagues show that to understand and treat a childs anxiety it is essential to take account of the social context within which it occurs whether it be war domestic violence child abuse out of home placement parental separation parental mental health problems or childhood disability this book presents a developmental and systemic framework for conceptualizing childrens anxieties and a fascinating series of complex case studies written by experienced clinicians childrens anxiety will be of interest to all mental health professionals who provide clinical services to young people in clinical and educational settings
5281020 this book provides a refreshing approach towards understanding the development and maintenance of anxiety in children with chapters organized around individuals rather than types of disorder nine chapters each by an expert clinician present case studies emphasizing developmental context and set within a range of theoretical and clinical orientations the volume forms a coherent whole with three comprehensive introductory chapters and a final chapter of unifying conclusions an excellent thought provoking book for research workers as well as clinicians and indeed anyone interested in the psychology of anxiety

5281106 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5281107 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
5281108 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
5281109 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
5281110 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person
5281111 im drawing on 20 years of accumulated experience using models
5281112 nouriel has a different way of seeing things than most economists he gets into everything
5281113 the most brilliant economist who never wrote down an equation
5281114 were in uncharted territory where standard economic theory isnt helpful
5281115 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
5281116 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
5281117 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
5281118 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
5281119 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
5281120 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
5281121 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
5281122 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
5281123 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
5281124 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
5281125 a good third of the regional banks wont make it
5281126 our biggest financiers are china russia and the gulf states
5281127 once you run current account deficits you depend on the kindness of strangers

5281333 the gimmicky measures on some of these social issues have failed to catch fire even at the signature gathering phase
5281334 theres quite a few social issues and generally conservative leaning social issues though theres no dominating issue

5281359 the men in the politburo werent businessmen in crises they werent worried about losing billions of their personal funds if things went wrong
5281360 its a positive step and a reflection of where were at in society as parents and kids want to make sure they feel safe at all times
5281361 using camera footage against bullying is a side benefit that ensures kids think ill be more careful about what i do and say
5281362 we dont live in the small community we used to some of the crime element is moving in and so people are concerned they want to be protected

5281367 we know that obesity per se is a risk factor for developing heart disease
5281368 but once you develop it is obesity more detrimental than not being overweight there have been different studies with results going both ways
5281369 with low dose statin therapy obesity was detrimental with more blockage what was unexpected was that with high doses of the statin obesity did not have much of an effect at all
5281370 they lower inflammation and people who are obese have greater inflammation there is a lot of evidence that inflammation in general is not good since a person who is obese has more of that going on statins tend to protect
5281371 what we can say is that if you have heart disease particularly if you had bypass surgery you should be on a good dose of a statin
5281372 if you are overweight or obese you really should take your statin and be aggressive about it
5281373 you get much more benefit than for someone who is thinner
5281374 limbs have been severed and mutilated people have been subjected to such brutal head injuries that their sight and hearing have been affected

5281379 section 377 is applicable even to the heterosexuals as it prohibits anal sex even between husband and wife we are demanding that consensual sex in private between individuals not be considered illegal but section 377 is needed so that children are not abused hence it should be read down but not abolished
5281380 its nice to know people at the top level are speaking for us
5281381 when one speaks individually to parents and friends there is a conditional change and acceptance but when one starts agitating for rights in front of police politician etc i find there is a huge homophobia there is no acceptance

5281391 there has been a long campaign by power coal and oil companies to mislead the public about the science of global warming
5281392 to the public nuisance of global warming by convincing the public at large and the victims of global warming that the process is not man made when in fact it is
5281393 the result of the increased storm damage is a massive erosion problem
5281394 houses and buildings are in imminent danger of falling into the sea
5281395 public nuisance law has been used from time immemorial to address issues that have not been addressed by the political branches
5281396 its very difficult to get a court to jump in here and say that what these companies are doing and have been doing for years is unreasonable and creating a public nuisance
5281397 the kind of harms to property and public welfare caused by global warming are classic public nuisance injuries
5281398 rather than unreasonably suing companies for the weather we would encourage everyone to join peabody in supporting aggressive development of carbon capture and storage projects and other technologies that help us provide both energy security and carbon solutions
5281399 the recycling of this type of discredited conspiracy theory only diverts attention from the real challenge at hand how to provide the energy to improve living standards while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions

5281431 i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely and one of the things that i strongly believe is that you know we are not going to as individuals erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront it when we see it
5281432 be anxious for nothing but by prayer and supplication make your requests known unto god and he will give you peace that passes all understanding

5281441 keep growing and changing well into retirement i would hope that i would continue to do one thing that terrifies me each day until i die

5281458 hi ghislaine what are you doing here and where are the other girls
5281459 umm i needed some time alone so i went for a walk

5281462 are we going to the hotel to the other girls
5281463 true friendship is a sacred important thing and it happens when we drop down into that deeper level of who we are when we cross over into the broken fragile parts of ourselves we have to give something up in order to get friendship like that we have to give up our need to be perceived as perfect we have to give up our ability to control what people think of us we have to overcome the fear that when they see the depth of who we are theyll leave but what we give up is nothing in comparison to what this kind of friendship gives to us friendship is about risk love is about risk if we can control it and manage it and manufacture it then its something else but if its really love really friendship its a little scary around the edges
5281464 because feeding the people i love is a hands on way of loving them when you nourish and sustain someone essentially youre saying that you want them to thrive to be happy and healthy and able to live well
5281465 so when im on the edge peering over into the unknown trembling and terrified to move forward devastatingly afraid to take that next step i practice believing that full life is beyond the fear god is god he is leading my life and that he is saying to me as he has been saying to his people throughout history i will never leave you and ive left reminders all around if you have the eyes to see them

5281469 dan dirikanlah shalat dan tunaikanlah zakat serta rukulah bersama orang orang yang ruku
5281470 adapun dalil dari al kitab adalah firman nya yanga artinya
5281471 dan apabila kamu berada di tengah tengah mereka shahabatmu lalu kamu hendak mendirikan shalat bersama sama mereka maka hendaklah segolongan dari mereka berdiri shalat besertamu dan menyandang senjata
5281472 ketika allah memerintahkan shalat berjamaah dalam keadaan takut menunjukkan dalam keadaan aman lebih wajib lagi
5281473 kembalilah kalian dan jadilah bersama mereka serta ajarilah mereka dan shalatlah kalian apabila telah datang waktu shalat hendaklah salah seorang di antara kalian adzan dan hendaklah orang yang paling tua berilmu tentang al kitab amp as sunnah dan paling banyak hafalan al qur annya di antara kalian mengimami kalian
5281474 rasulullah memerintahkan kami apabila kalian di masjid lalu diseru shalat dikumandangkan adzan pent maka janganlah keluar salah seorang di antara kalian sampai dia shalat di masjid secara
5281475 ya rasulullah sesungguhnya saya tidak mempunyai seorang penuntun yang mengantarkanku ke masjid
5281476 sesungghunya ilmu ini adalah agama maka hendaklah salah seorang dari kalian melihat dari mana ia mengambil agamanya
5281477 mereka salafush shalih tidak menanyakan tentang isnad suatu hadits tetapi ketika terjadinya fitnah setelah terbunuhnya utsman bin affan pent maka mereka mengatakan
5281478 pada hari betis disingkapkan dan mereka dipanggil untuk bersujud maka mereka tidak mampu untuk sujud dalam keadaan pandangan mereka tunduk ke bawah lagi mereka diliputi kehinaan dan sesungguhnya mereka dahulu di dunia diseru untuk bersujud dan mereka dalam keadaan sejahtera
5281479 mereka mendengar adzan dan panggilan untuk shalat tetapi mereka tidak menjawabnya
5281480 demi allah tidaklah ayat ini diturunkan kecuali terhadap orang orang yang menyelisihi dari shalat berjamaah
5281481 mereka mendengar panggilan hayya alal falaah tetapi tidak memenuhi panggilan tersebut
5281482 yaitu mereka diseru dengan adzan dan iqamah tetapi mereka enggan memenuhi seruan tersebut
5281483 yakni mereka diseru kepada shalat yang wajib dengan adzan dan iqamah
5281484 dan dalam ayat ini terdapat ancaman bagi orang yang meninggalkan shalat berjamaah
5281485 dan sungguh mereka pada waktu di dunia telah diseru untuk sujud sedang mereka dalam keadaan sejahtera
5281486 dan telah berkata lebih dari satu dari salafush shalih tentang firman allah taala
5281487 apabila engkau melihat mendapatkan orang yang mengenteng entengkan bermudah mudahan dalam masalah takbiratul ihram maka bersihkanlah badanmu darinya

5281505 perkataan seluruh manusia bisa diterima atau ditolak hanya perkataan penghuni kubur ini yakni rasulullah yang wajib diterima tidak boleh ditolak
5281506 setiap manusia bisa diambil atau ditinggalkan perkataan mereka begitu pula apa apa yang datang dari para salafus shalih sebelum kita yang sesuai dengan al quran dan as sunnah kecuali hanya rasulullah
5281507 dan janganlah kamu mengatakan terhadap apa yang disebut sebut oleh lidahmu secara dusta
5281508 sesungguhnya allah tidak mencabut ilmu secara begitu saja dalam diri manusia tetapi dicabutnya ilmu melalui wafatnya para ulama sehingga orang berilmu tidak tersisa lalu manusia menjadikan orang bodoh menangani urusan mereka mereka ditanya lalu menjawab dengan tanpa ilmu akhirnya mereka sesat dan menyesatkan
5281509 sesungguhnya di antara tanda tanda kiamat adalah diambilnya ilmu agama dari kalangan ashaghir
5281510 sesungguhnya orang yang paling aku cintai dan paling dekat majelisnya denganku pada hari kiamat nanti adalah yang paling baik akhlaknya di antara kalian dan sesungguhnya yang paling saya benci dan paling jauh dariku adalah yang banyak omongnya ats tsartsarun bermulut besar al mutasyaddiqun dan al mutafaihiqun
5281511 yaitu al mutakabbirun orang yang merasa besar sok berilmu hr imam at tirmidzi
5281512 dan janganlah kalian menjerumuskan diri kalian dengan tangan kalian sendiri ke dalam jurang kerusakan
5281513 sesungguhnya pemboros pemboros itu adalah saudara saudara syaitan dan syaitan itu adalah sangat ingkar kepada tuhannya
5281514 dan orang orang yang memelihara amanat amanat yang dipikulnya dan janjinya
5281515 yaitu jika diberi amanah ia tidak mengkhianatinya bahkan ia menunaikannya kepada pihak yang memberinya
5281516 t anda orang munafik ada tiga jika bicara ia dusta jika janji ia ingkar jika diberi amanah ia khianat
5281517 di antara baiknya islam seseorang adalah ia meninggalkan hal hal yang tidak bermanfaat
5281518 barangsiapa yang memudharatkan merusak seorang muslim yang lain maka allah akan memudharatkannya barang siapa yang menyulitkan orang lain maka allah akan menyulitkan orang itu
5281519 maka barangsiapa yang menimbulkan mudharat pada dirinya sendiri dan pada orang lain berarti ia tidak berbuat baik dan barangsiapa yng tidak berbuat baik berarti menentang perintah allah untuk berbuat baik dalam segala sesuatu
5281520 barangsiapa yang menyerupai suatu kaum maka ia telah menjadi bagian kaum itu
5281521 dan janganlah kamu mengikuti apa yang kamu tidak mempunyai pengetahuan tentangnya sesungguhnya pendengaran penglihatan dan hati semuanya itu akan diminta pertanggungan jawabnya
5281522 hukum asal segala sesuatu urusan dunia adalah mubah boleh kecuali ada dalil syariat yang mengharamkannya nah kami tidak menemukan dalil pengharamannya
5281523 kami pusing jika tidak merokok jika merokok kami kembali tenang dan konsentrasi
5281524 yaitu orang orang yang beriman dan hati mereka manjadi tenteram dengan mengingat allah ingatlah hanya dengan mengingati allah lah hati menjadi tenteram
5281525 saya pernah ditanya tentang hukum tembakau yang sering dihisap oleh orang yang belum paham tentang haramnya rokok maka kami jawab bahwa kami kalangan para ulama dan syaikh syaikh kita yang dahulu para ahli ilmu para imam dawah ahli najd daerah antara makkah dan madinah dahulu sampai sekarang menghukumi bahwa rokok itu haram berdasarkan dalil yang shahih dan akal yang waras serta penelitian para dokter yang masyhur
5281526 perokok penjualnya dan orang yang membantunya semuanya haram tidak halal bagi umat islam memperolehnya baik untuk dihisap atau untuk dijual barangsiapa yang memperolehnya hendaknya ia bertaubat dengan taubat nasuha dari semua dosa sebab rokok ini masuk kepada dalil keumuman nash teks al quran yang menunjukkan haram baik lafazh atau makna dst
5281527 tembakau dan rokok adalah perkara yang hampir sama keduanya memiliki daya tarik dan pengaruh yang kuat bagi para pecandunya sehingga begitu menakjubkan seolah olah tidak ada daya tarik yang melebihi rokok kita saksikan bersama betapa gelisahnya para penghisap rokok jika dia ingin merokok sedangkan ia tidak punya uang maka ia akan mencari temannya yang merokok untuk mengemis walau satu batang hal ini kami ceritakan karena kami melihatnya sendiri yang lucu pengemis rokok itu orang yang berkedudukan tinggi tetapi karena kuatnya dorongan untuk merokok membuat dirinya menjual harga dirinya untuk mengemis rokok walau satu batang
5281528 kami mengatakan bahwa rokok selama hal itu telah dinyatakan membahayakan maka hukumnya haram lebih lebih jika dokter spesialis sudah menetapkan hal itu kepada orang tertentu sekali pun tidak jelas bahayanya terhadap kesehatan tetapi yang jelas hal itu termasuk membuang uang untuk yang tidak bermanfaat baik untuk agama atau urusan dunia dalam hadits dengan tegas rasulullah melarang membuang buang harta keharamannya lebih kuat lagi jika ternyata sebenarnya ia amat memerlukan uang itu untuk dirinya atau keluarganya
5281529 seandainya manusia berinfak seluruh hartanya untuk kebenaran bukanlah termasuk tabdzir tetapi berinfaq di jalan yang bukan al haq walau satu mud itulah yang mubadzir

5281547 el partido no es propiedad de un reducido grupo de personas
5281548 de nada sirve que nos presentemos ante nuestros votantes como un partido innovador que apuesta por una nueva forma de entender la pol tica y la democracia si upd no cumple con una serie de requisitos recogidos en la ley de partidos pol ticos en la constituci n espa ola y en sus propios estatutos
5281549 a las sucesivas reuniones del consejo pol tico desde la fundaci n del partido se ha ido desconvocando a consejeros sin motivo alguno ese hecho tambi n ha ocurrido con algunos miembros de las coordinadoras y se ha repetido en algunos comit s locales los miembros del consejo pol tico rara vez han efectuado votaciones y en cuanto ha habido alguien con posiciones cr ticas inmediatamente ha sido censurado
5281550 del consejo de direcci n de upd han salido casi la mitad de sus miembros y del consejo pol tico otros tantos
5281551 el consejo de direcci n est formado por 20 personas de ellos unos ocho han sido invitados a abandonarlo y otros han dimitido voluntariamente
5281552 no nos parece un modo de actuar adecuado de uno de los dos m ximos rganos del partido entre congresos sobre todo si adem s su renovaci n no ha sido votada por el consejo pol tico responde a una iniciativa de un reducido grupo de personas y adem s como sabemos no cuenta con el respaldo de todo el consejo de direcci n
5281553 se han escrito muchas cartas al consejo de direcci n quej ndonos de esta falta de democracia interna y nunca nos han respondido
5281554 miembros del partido en esta comunidad se han reunido para tratar formas de solucionar estos problemas y han sido desautorizados por la direcci n que ha decidido apoyar a la coordinadora auton mica
5281555 por supuesto que la seguida hasta ahora no es la forma de hacer upd
5281556 la ineficacia organizativa es total el primer congreso tardar todav a un a o y tres meses en realizarse y a los que tenemos la osad a de denunciar los fallos y defender la democratizaci n urgente se nos acusa de trapisondistas trepas traidores y no s cuantas cosas m s

5281561 johnny was sent to bed one night without dessert when he was nine but he fought back against the adversity and now here he is in the skeet shooting finals
5281562 he played very well but he had some thing with his ankle and it was impossible to continue
5281563 now we have to send a letter and to discuss ballack with oliver bierhoff and joachim low and the national team from germany because its impossible for the doctor to say that it is a problem or not for the future we hope that next wednesday or next sunday hes in condition to play bit i think its difficult
5281564 if indeed these were serious acts why did the idf allow him to continue to serve for seven additional months after the wire tapping was terminated
5281565 his conversations were documented in which you can hear him transferring and receiving information on data related to different points in the fence talking about handing over information to people and holding coded conversations about smuggling on the border
5281566 i dont like it thomas i like it hi 5 come mummy get up i show you i like it your green eyes very pretty mummy daddy have it brown eyes like me mummy you no like it bread no you like chocolate yes i like it chocolate i dont like it thomas i want hi 5 no fairies i like it fairies ava grumpy she dont like me no more
5281567 ive been a doctor for 35 years and this is the first time ive ever seen such a thing happen this is somewhat of a medical miracle weve informed the health ministry and i guess theyll appoint a commission of inquiry the hospital will ask for an external investigation of the case
5281568 because of just how premature she is her chances are very slim then again she already saw divine intervention once so you never know were doing everything we can for her

5281570 the collection is closed because it has come to our attention that there is restricted material in the collection once the collection has been processed it will be open to any patron interested in viewing it
5281571 these folders are restricted via annenberg challenge until further notice
5281572 libraries of course exist not to restrict information but to make it available to the public i would hate to think that uic library was doing anything less than all it could to permit public access to these important materials
5281573 has alerted us to the fact that we do not have a signed deed of gift
5281574 we hope to be able to provide access within the next few weeks
5281575 i did not find any who were involved in the actual decision making process who have expressed regret and say openly that they made a mistake
5281576 nor have there been too many who said they wouldnt do it again
5281577 i found about five who said this but they were not involved in the decision making process
5281578 i was in favor of the disengagement hoping it would bring peace with the palestinians but i was wrong
5281579 and that weakness brought about attacks in gaza and the north it did not contribute to security or to peace it did not prove itself in very many regards though it did give us much maneuverability with regard to the global sphere
5281580 i admit and i confess that i was among those who strongly supported former pm ariel sharon and the disengagement today i say with my head held high we erred we made a very big mistake withdrawals can only work when the areas are handed over to responsible hands and rooted in agreements and international guarantees here we have a precedent a territory we left turns into a base for terror period
5281581 at the time i thought differently but there is now no doubt that the disengagement was an error it has resulted in the formation of a hamastan state in gaza in addition there is an entire population that is still without homes and with unsolved problems many thousands of people i believe that we should admit openly the disengagement was a mistake
5281582 unilateral withdrawal from the west bank would not be a wise step for israel to take when one sees what happened in gaza and sees the political advantage that hamas has taken of the situation to claim unilateral victory and now to be part of the pa government how many failures do you need before you recognize that its a failure
5281583 there has become a slight trend of late for commentators to say that the disengagement was a mistake but i dont trust them they often continue to support further withdrawals but i do see hope from a different direction the public many people truly see the folly of the disengagement especially after the second lebanon war and the kassam rockets and the buildup of hamas and i have confidence that if there would be a referendum on a future withdrawal it would be defeated
5281584 so who are using these services a high ranking amazon executive told me there are 60 000 different customers across the various amazon web services and most of them are not the startups that are normally associated with on demand computing rather the biggest customers in both number and amount of computing resources consumed are divisions of banks pharmaceuticals companies and other large corporations who try aws once for a temporary project and then get hooked

5281600 a 25 gb hd movie would take only 70 seconds to transfer between devices
5281601 studies show that a consumers patience on waiting time is about 1 5 minutes and after 5 minutes they abort what they were doing that same file transferred over high speed usb would take 13 9 minutes an unacceptable wait time for most people

5281629 assuming the completion of our proposed divestitures we will have acquired approximately 600 million of new assets in each of greater buffalo wallow and east texas north louisiana this year and fund it primarily by selling 800 million 1 1 billion of non core properties we expect as our asset quality continues to improve and our operations get more focused we can become even more efficient than we now are and deliver even better margins from our operations with a higher organic growth rate

5281733 i think good ceos manage to find company customer and shareholder attitudes that fit their budgets you have to balance the need to run and grow your company with things that are nice to have in a tough environment like we have now the frills go first you quickly focus on say 4 of the 8 things you thought you needed to grow and the nice to haves go out the window its a matter of balance and perspective but from time to time things get out of whack
5281734 the ability of corporate leaders to absorb new information about markets technological change and other economic events make quick decisions to capitalize on such information and manage associated risks is a strength of the us economy that should not be underrated or lightly discarded

5281951 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5281952 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5281953 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5281954 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5281955 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5281956 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5281957 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5281958 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5281967 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5281968 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5281969 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5281970 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5281971 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5282028 i think john mccains reaction to what happened in russia did not reflect well on the position he should have taken and that is one of understanding we have one president in this country and that secretary of state rice and president bush need the support of both presidential candidates in a very tricky time as it relates to russia and the neighboring states that are trying to establish democracies
5282029 i think him doing press releases and sending some of his political allies to georgia i think some of it began to ring like a political campaign instead of principled and strong diplomacy
5282030 they accused barack obama of being presumptuous for going to europe and meeting with our allies
5282031 what is presumptuous is to try to undercut in any way the very difficult and tricky work that president bush and secretary rice are trying to do right now
5282032 i disagree with you in every way to suggest that john mccains response to the aggression in russia was anything other than appropriate
5282033 he called for an international peacekeeping force he called for humanitarian aid he called it exactly what it is unprovoked aggression

5282047 weve had a very disturbing trend of school shootings in the us
5282048 it is my belief this is caused by making schools gun free zones when schools were made gun free zones they became targets for people who wanted to rack up the body count
5282049 its up there with the worst ideas in the history of education
5282050 you could have a gun accidentally taken away or a gun could be dislodged or discharged while a teachers breaking up a fight in the cafeteria

5282062 i deny the charges that economic crisis is caused by policies of my government in the past nine years
5282063 we are very conscious that problems will remain with us
5282064 i dont think any other leader would have had that kind of commitment
5282065 he is the person behind the peace process and he was the first pakistani leader to reorient pakistans policy toward kashmir and ensure intra kashmiri interaction his leaving would create a void
5282066 pakistans economy is in a poor condition politics is in complete chaos and theres a rise in militancy and violence
5282067 he was personally tolerant and liberal but his positive contributions are not enough to overshadow his negative ones
5282068 we can help people we can help youngsters because weve got a voice and weve got a voice that kids listen to

5282092 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5282093 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5282094 in addition i stopped 2 000 illegal immigrants from getting to canada saving canadian taxpayers at least 25 000 for each refugee claim or 50 million
5282095 i was told people sucked in wind shocked because they probably recognized some of the names theyd thought were upstanding hong kong businessmen
5282096 my first report was immediately leaked to media in hong kong and to someone in the globe and mail most likely leaked by people in the consulate
5282097 i had phenomenal contacts in hong kong i cant tell you who they were i was bombarded with information by people wondering what canada was doing being absolute fools allowing these people into their country
5282098 the first time quite shocked me i was sitting in my office one night on the 24th floor of a modern office building the phone rang i thought it was going to be my wife
5282099 instead the person described what colour tie i was wearing what colour suit i was wearing he could read what was on my desk he had to have had binoculars or a telescope i was hoping the telescope wasnt attached to a gun
5282100 i was constantly intimidated and the more it happened the more i knew i was doing the right thing so i just kept going
5282101 in the first two weeks after i arrived in hong kong my wife and i were invited to the happy valley race track by a well known businessman he gave us little red packets we opened them when we got home each one had about 250
5282102 i was very disturbed by that and told my boss that i was going to return the money
5282103 i was told it was in cash amounts of 1 000 and up for a staff member and for his or her spouse
5282104 thats the question that was just openers to see who was going to take bait
5282105 i made it known i was not prepared to accept any money
5282106 maybe three or four people among the canadian staff would speak to me
5282107 i was excited it was a continuation of the work id done with the immigration department
5282108 i argued that they should be upset because a number of people were very incompetent and a number of people were obviously corrupted within the canadian foreign service
5282109 it was the worst program so many flaws and so much corruption going on
5282110 id already discovered a lot of canadian immigration investor programs were being exploited by members of triads living in canada they made tens of millions of dollars from them
5282111 many of triads gained entry that way because 150 000 is a joke to them
5282112 i went home that night with an incredible weird feeling in my head i could actually feel the chemical change in my brain
5282113 the depression had built up over four years i defy anybody to work in an environment where your life is being threatened regularly where you know everybody youre working with hates you
5282114 one day my contact in the hong kong police department phoned me hed intercepted a phone call from mr x a triad kingpin talking to someone in the immigration department in ottawa
5282115 that person said to mr x dont worry about mcadam and what hes doing well take care of him
5282116 never that size but always branches falling down its sad that this is probably what it takes to have somebody come up there and cut all that down
5282117 they should at least close that off and put some kind of netting or have some kind of something a barricade or something

5282151 anxiety is that which divides and distracst the soul that which diverts us from present duty to weary calculations of how to meet conditions that may never arrive its the habit of crossing bridges before we come to them

5282161 the greater the sinner be the greater is his need of a saviour and the saving of the chief of sinners brings the chief honour and glory to the saviour though there be greater and smaller sins and sinners yet no man ever did or can believe as a little sinner least and less than the least of all saints we find a great saint saying eph 3 8 but never did any true saint either think or call himself a little sinner for as no man that seeth sin truly can call any sin small or little so no man that seeth himself to be a sinner really can count himself a small or a little sinner nor can it ever be till there be a little law to break a little god to offend a little guilt to contract and a little wrath to incur all which are impossible to be blasphemy to with and madness to expect

5282164 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
5282165 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
5282166 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
5282167 mostly that 20 percent drop is based on fear of another perhaps more damaging outage it hasnt happened but now i know it could happen any time and without warning and if it does i have virtually no recourse to get the service running again
5282168 if we began to experience a similar outage more than about two or three business hours per quarter wed probably make google apps and gmail a backup solution to a locally hosted mail system if we used it at all and it would likely be years before wed try a cloud based collaborative system again from any vendor
5282169 even though weve only had apps for a few days im already impressed with the customization options the ability to completely ditch outlook makes apps a worthwhile service to our company
5282170 the gmail interface feels more intuitive and is significantly quicker than outlook and the mobile accessibility is a huge improvement over our old e mail service
5282171 google understands its tremendous responsibility to keep things up and running
5282172 no ones happy when theres downtime but theres always downtime ive seen exchange go down often many times youre left to your own it people to fix it that can be good or bad id rather it be googles problem theyve got a world class team their reputation is on the line over time theyre going to get better and better

5282191 by taking a pool of equipment and dedicate it to the event and move it around instead of having to go through a deployment and purchasing cycle makes us more agile
5282192 so we were able to spread our load and use 25 different machines that werent at a peak time basically by doing that we were able to hold the peak load and there were no incremental capital costs
5282193 using the cdn for large scale assets like video delivery is the stated practice today no matter who youre talking to says albers

5282210 even the strongest person becomes mush when the topic turns to raises
5282211 just remember that your boss will also be uncomfortable talking about it with you
5282212 you could be the organizations powerpoint guru or possess some skill that everyone comes to you for help with
5282213 what you are effectively doing is running a marketing campaign for yourself you want to make sure youve got visibility with people other than your boss
5282214 a script will help you feel comfortable that you can objectively prove your worth to the organization
5282215 if a companys policy is to give annual raises its hard to get an exception to the rule
5282216 usually decisions come from senior management and your boss wont have any latitude to go outside the companys policy
5282217 the average person usually cant step aside from his or her emotions
5282218 also your manager may go on the defensive if you ask for a larger raise during your review
5282219 if your manager asks you what raise you have in mind you dont want to gasp and go blank
5282220 if you were offered a 3 percent raise you cant ask for 7 percent it just wont happen
5282221 if you got a 3 percent raise but want a 5 percent raise say ive accomplished xyz i possess xyz skills i put in extra time at the office and im a bit disappointed with the raise
5282222 be sure to use an i message rather than a you message it sounds less accusatory

5282311 we havent got too many split grains which has been a problem this year
5282312 most of its still standing although a couple of fields have gone down the second wheat looks very thin and pinched
5282313 it was the worst weve grown for 10 15 years
5282314 our mission is to secure the population defeat extremists and neutralize resistance groups increase the professionalism of the iraqi security forces build the capacity of government institutions and economic programs and transition security and local development tasks to the iraqi security forces and local governments over time
5282315 the improved security has enabled positive growth in governance and economic systems creating tangible improvements in the daily lives of babil citizens
5282316 as a result the people of babil trust the 31st brigade to provide security
5282317 we employ just over 9 500 sois who man static checkpoints to thicken security lines between the iraqi army and the police positions in the cities
5282318 the persistent presence of these security forces highlights to the iraqi people that the isf is committed to their security and it stimulates human intelligence gathering and productive economic growth
5282319 within the last three months the governor the provincial council leaders and directors general have traveled to north babil a feat that was inconceivable a year ago
5282320 we still have work to do in the areas of security water flow clean water and agricultural initiatives
5282321 but with a newly formed connection between local and provincial government such improvements are achievable
5282322 and now with the signature of the georgian president on this cease fire accord all russian troops and any irregular and paramilitary forces that entered with them must leave immediately
5282323 the solidarity of the united states with georgia and its people in this moment of crisis
5282324 that is americas position and in my discussions with my european colleagues it is the position of the europeans as well
5282325 the russian attack on georgia had profound implications and will have profound implications for russias relations with its neighbors and with the world
5282326 but our most urgent task today is the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
5282327 and eventually we need a more robust and impartial peacekeeping international force that would follow those monitors
5282328 we are under a russian invasion and russian occupation right now
5282329 and we want to end this russian invasion and occupation
5282330 access must be immediate and unimpeded for those humanitarian efforts
5282331 when the security situation in georgia is stabilized we will turn immediately to reconstruction
5282332 to rapidly develop an economic support package for the georgian economy to build on its demonstrated track record and to resume its rapid growth
5282333 restore georgias economy and reinforce investor confidence as georgia returns to its position as the leading economy in the region
5282334 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
5282335 the free world will now have to wrestle with the profound implications of this russian attack on its neighbor for security in the region and beyond
5282336 now that president medvedev has reportedly signed the cease fire agreement i assume that russian forces are going to begin to withdraw expeditiously
5282337 president medvedev of russia has now signed on to the terms of this agreement and thats an important development its a hopeful step
5282338 continue to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
5282339 these regions are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia
5282340 and there will have to be a negotiated solution on that basis
5282341 we do want to send a strong message of support for georgia
5282342 georgia is going to emerge from this and its infrastructure will be rebuilt
5282343 in recent days u s cargo planes carrying humanitarian supplies have arrived in georgia in the days ahead we will continue using u s aircraft and other assets as needed to deliver more humanitarian and medical supplies
5282344 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
5282345 continue to rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
5282346 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5282347 georgia is a member of the united nations and south ossetia and abkhazia lie within its internationally recognized borders
5282348 georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations
5282349 we will continue to insist that georgias sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity be respected
5282350 when this requirement came up we had to figure out how do we make this happen quickly
5282351 we had to get the georgian troops back and sustain what we have going in iraq and afghanistan
5282352 in the 36 hours from notification to when we started flying missions it all came together
5282353 it was a total teamwork effort from a planning perspective
5282354 it was also a great team effort on the part of aircrew members maintainers and loaders
5282355 i think we had about 36 to 48 hours to plan this
5282356 we got wind of the mission and began working closely with our contacts at u s european command
5282357 we wanted the missions to be fast visible and effective
5282358 we work with our customers across the globe and depending on what needs to be moved and how quickly it needs to be there we will find the right mode of transportation
5282359 sealift is a possibility and we are working with the navys military sealift command to examine the possibilities
5282360 in this case in a two day effort there was hardly any impact on sustainment operations or deployments in iraq afghanistan or elsewhere
5282361 had it been a longer term operation over time there would be some degradation but that would not happen to troops in contact
5282362 to my mind the real beauty of it was our young men and women who maintain and launch and load and fly these airplanes that they were able to respond and make this move happen
5282363 they took a chance because thats what they were called to do and they did a phenomenal job
5282364 it all boils down to we have a mission to do and we do it
5282365 our motto out here is a promise made is a promise kept in this case america made a promise to an ally and we kept that promise
5282366 this defendant preyed on the most vulnerable among us to make a fast buck using fear violence and intimidation he forced women and children into the tragic world of prostitution and drugs
5282367 the prison sentence handed down today denies webster the freedom he denied his victims and those who commit similar crimes should expect to be prosecuted

5282417 the 2008 theme for the diversity tour is diversity in namibian culture with the intention that namibian learners will immerse themselves in different cultural environments to learn the significance of valuing their own culture while also finding the respect and appreciation for other cultures
5282418 the peace corps volunteers achieve this goal by focusing on raising awareness of diversity issues in namibia creating a better understanding of diversity in the united states and increasing and developing educational opportunities which promote diversity
5282419 these include going on a game drive playing in the ocean for the first time and perhaps most importantly engaging in meaningful interactions and form strong friendships with fellow youth from different cultural backgrounds yet the same national heritage it is through this last point that the tour chiefly succeeds in breaking down tribal stereotypes and unifying the youth of namibia

5282432 letland heeft het hoogste aantal studenten in universitair onderwijs in de eu dat zal er wel iets mee te maken hebben
5282433 je bent jong creatief en je wilt iets doen dan kun je maar beter een eigen magazine uitgeven
5282434 vroeger was het de leninstraat toen werd het de stalinstraat toen de hitlerstraat daarna weer de leninstraat en nu heet het de vrijheidsstraat
5282435 ik leg mijn studenten altijd uit dat wanneer je een idee wilt hebben wat er in rookgordijn rusland aan de hand is dan lees je zorgvuldig deze publicaties wil je weten wat er in het veel kleinere en minder ingewikkelde letland aan de hand is wat lees je dan ik moet je het antwoord schuldig blijven
5282436 er bestaat geen onafhankelijke journalistiek in letland de situatie hier lijkt meer op de italiaanse verschillende clans hebben controle over de media je kunt het conflict het best beschrijven over een breuklijn die loopt tussen de lokale oligarchen en de westerse liberalen hoewel je beide begrippen met een flinke korrel zout moet nemen
5282437 ik werkte een tijd als televisiecriticus bij diena de grootste krant van letland ik stak mijn politieke mening niet onder stoelen of banken soms kom je daar nu eenmaal niet onderuit ook in mijn academisch onderzoek schreef ik soms kritisch over diena en zo was ik mijn baan als televisierecensent al weer kwijt
5282438 ze zijn een tijdje zelfs gestopt me te bellen voor quotes
5282439 tot de hoofdredacteur onlangs veranderde nog geen twee weken later wou men weer van me horen journalistiek het is hier pure politieke business
5282440 eigenlijk is het een campagne tussen sorosisten en anti sorosisten
5282441 dat begon in december 2005 toen de krant neatkariga een sterke toon aansloeg tegen george soros een campagne die vrijwel naadloos paste bij de russische anti soros campagne sinds oktober 2005
5282442 diena is pro neatkariga is contra je ziet het overal terugkomen de sorosisten of liberalen zijn voor een gay pride in de stad de anti sorosisten of lokale oligarchen die de meer traditionele waarden in pacht houden die zijn dus tegen
5282443 een echt debat is er niet het geruzie begint een paar dagen voor de pride en is daarna weer snel afgelopen in het hele debat heb ik drie redelijke argumenten gezien aan beide kanten de rest is nonsens journalisten gaan niet pro actief op zoek naar andere argumenten of verhaallijnen ze volgen de lijn van de redactie
5282444 die moest wel reageren omdat de anti sorosisten de liberale waarden nederlands vonden en het een en ander in verband brachten met de pedofielenpartij
5282445 diena is lets maar wilde in de loop naar de toetreding tot de europese unie haar anti russische toon matigen daarom huurde men etnische russische journalisten in zo stond er bijvoorbeeld een keer op 1 september de eerste schooldag een grote foto van een jongetje laten we hem vanja ivanov noemen een typische russische voor en achternaam en zijn trotse ouders ze stuurde hem naar een letse school omdat ze dachten dat daar meer toekomst in zat
5282446 journalisten hier hebben geen bond nodig ze zijn slechts in dienst van hun werkgever er bestaat geen professionele attitude onderzoek wijst ook uit dat een ruime meerderheid van de journalisten er geen probleem in ziet te schrijven wat hun werkgever hen opdraagt wie zich verzet tegen de hoofdredactie is de volgende dag ontslagen
5282447 er is geen visie onder uitgevers er is geen professionele strategie voor media business rijke zakenlieden kopen kranten of uitgeverijen als visitekaartje zonder een flauw idee te hebben wat ze er mee moeten doen er zit geen visie achter

5282501 you gotta understand that for most of its existence atlantic city largely had a monopoly on east coast casinos in that earlier era you did not have to work particularly hard to operate at close to capacity the customers were there because they really couldnt go anywhere else
5282502 if it aint broken dont fix it when we came in we just knew there could be more
5282503 i know for a fact that were hurting atlantic city because a lot of their high rollers are coming here and they love it here because theyre minutes away
5282504 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone
5282505 it was a shocking set of remarks and people were looking around the room in disbelief
5282506 it was far more blatant a threat than anything were used to hearing from many of the leaders
5282507 the whole thing was incredible malcolm got up there and thanked everyone for coming and told them we should think of his fund raising event as being like an ipo an initial public offering
5282508 he said we should get in early because then it doesnt cost as much the longer you wait to get in he said the more it will cost you and if you dont get in at all then it will be painful after november after the democrats win the majority
5282509 then he referred to bronx state sen jeff klein about four times as his enforcer who is going to be brutal aggressive about collecting the contributions and that he was the one managing the ipo
5282510 the golf was called off because of rain so the program was being shortened and the dinner was held early
5282511 smith was up there joking about what was going on about the dinner ending early and then said something like if anybody needs a permission slip for their spouse so that they can say you were here for a few hours more ill say you were here until 8 youre covered until about 8
5282512 there was only one way to interpret that cheating on your spouse even if it was a joke
5282513 he couldve ended up dead im really angry at the people who dont follow the rules
5282514 the real concerns are people driving 4 000 pound machines that have the ability to kill pedestrians cyclists and people in wheelchairs
5282515 in 22 years of commuting to oakland i have never seen a cyclist stop at a red light or stop sign
5282516 theres a physics argument on why some bikers dont stop at stop signs
5282517 i dont see why bikes are special and not subject to the speed limit
5282518 it is my intention to make sure everyone understands those laws
5282519 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5282520 he needs to come to the aisle of home depot and show them that a harvard graduate which i am as well knows how to help them
5282521 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
5282522 ich kann es nicht fassen und bin bergl cklich die meisterschaft schon beim vorletzten rennen gewonnen zu haben m glich war dieser erfolg durch ein auto das mit seiner balance nicht nur fantastisch zu fahren ist sondern zudem technisch ohne jegliche probleme durch die saison fuhr
5282523 und nat rlich durch unser team das ebenso fehlerfrei gearbeitet hat dass wir auch den teamtitel gewonnen haben unterstreicht die leistung der crew der heutige erfolg und der meistertitel sind nach meinem sieg bei den 24 stunden von le mans im juni ein weiteres highlight meiner rennfahrerkarriere
5282524 ich habe unheimlich gepusht um druck auf jos zu machen vor der schikane kam es zu einem missverst ndnis mit einem konkurrenten und in der folge zu meinem ausflug ins kiesbett rgerlich ist es auch weil unser auto heute unglaublich gut lag
5282525 gratulation an jos er hat den titel verdient denn er hat in der ganzen saison keine fehler gemacht
5282526 wir h tten die meisterschaft gerne offen gehalten und nach d nemark geholt ber unseren dritten platz freuen wir uns trotzdem wir waren von den rundenzeiten her so nah dran am van merksteijn porsche wie nie zuvor
5282527 unser auto lag heute sehr gut der neue vierliter sechszylinder motor im heck geht richtig gut und das team hat fantastisch gearbeitet dass wir dennoch keine siegchance hatten lag an den reifen die auf kurvenreichen strecken wie dem n rburgring nicht optimal arbeiten
5282528 das rennen war ungemein anstrengend und der verkehr streckenweise der reine horror aber wir haben uns gut geschlagen und das maximum herausgeholt

5282670 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
5282671 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
5282672 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
5282673 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
5282674 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
5282675 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
5282676 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
5282677 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
5282678 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
5282679 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
5282680 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
5282681 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
5282682 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing

5282685 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
5282686 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
5282687 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
5282688 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
5282689 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

5282697 citrix resellers determine the price at which they sell to their customers based on their purchase price from distributors their business model and the overall scope of each solution
5282698 the increase is a result of the rising costs of doing business globally based upon the inflation of various currencies in comparison to the us dollar upon which citrix pricing is based
5282699 we should be in the beginning of changing the current development model which is based on man made energy the fossil fuel to renewable resource based sustainable development

5282707 well you could sell them for a profit and use the money to buy trawlers to catch even more fishes
5282708 you sell them for even greater profits buy over a fishing fleet and start your own company
5282709 well with all that money in the world you dont have to work any more and you can do anything you like

5282722 dude how can you live in that colony with all the tunnels an insect has to be outside breathe get in touch with nature
5282723 i get time to go out and experience nature but our colony is very efficient its warm in the winter and we conserve our resources
5282724 yeah man conservation all the way i totally support government research towards developing new sources of food i think the new solar powered plants are going to be huge weve got to wean ourselves from foreign species but dude you gotta try some of this colombian weed
5282725 but grasshopper all the government research and solar power are going to be wasted as long as youve got everyone traveling these huge distances by themselves were going to be reaching the peak of this solar season and pretty soon energy will be scarce i hope youre prepared
5282726 dont worry ant man as long as im in touch with nature nothing bad can happen
5282727 dear senator antdams i am hungry and the grass and leaves are drying up please help
5282728 many of my colleagues have constituents who need relief from dried up grasses they do not have the alternatives of a strong stockpile as we do in the ant colony therefore i propose that we take the ant colonys stockpile and use it to feed the grasshoppers so they can hop around outside
5282729 but senator that stockpile was supposed to last all winter if you use up our stockpile well go hungry
5282730 insects are hurting and they need relief my proposal will give them that relief what do you propose
5282731 well the grasshoppers have been stingy with us chasing us away from leaves and grasses im sorely tempted to keep the stockpile and let them die but weve worked so hard this past summer that i think we have just enough to get us all ants and grasshoppers through the winter
5282732 but and this is a big but the grasshopper lifestyle is a mistake we can only afford to make once the grasshoppers are still planning to spend all next summer wastefully hopping large distances alone and not spending any time stockpiling food theyve got to change their plans and live more sustainably theyve got to commit to more efficient colony living and do more walking we should not share any of our stockpile with them until they make that commitment
5282733 hey sewell guess what next saturday im having a few friends over for some beers and conversation what do you say

5282767 though victory in iraq is finally in sight a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president says mccain
5282768 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5282769 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen
5282770 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5282771 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5282772 even in retrospect mccain says of his opponent who plans to address the vfw at its convention in orlando on tuesday
5282773 im proud to count many of you in this room as personal friends including my good friend retired marine corps sergeant major paul chevalier of new hampshire
5282774 all of us take pride in being members of this great organization
5282775 in all the years since the men and women of the vfw have stayed faithful to their mission of serving those who have served their country
5282776 the men and women of the vfw know the value of freedom because you have been its protectors
5282777 though victory in iraq is finally in sight a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president
5282778 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
5282779 thanks to the courage and sacrifice of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines and to brave iraqi fighters the surge has succeeded
5282780 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5282781 its been a while since most americans including most of our leaders and diplomats have viewed russia as a threat to the peace
5282782 for some time now i have been making the case for a dramatic acceleration of domestic energy production
5282783 when russia first invaded georgia some people may have wondered why events in this part of the world should be any concern of ours
5282784 if i am elected president they will have that support
5282785 through decades of struggle free nations prevailed over tyranny in large measure because of the sacrifices of the men and women of the united states armed forces
5282786 the walter reed scandal was a disgrace unworthy of this nation and i intend to make sure that nothing like it is ever repeated
5282787 reform begins with appointing a secretary of veterans affairs who is a leader of the highest caliber and who listens to veterans and veterans service organizations
5282788 veterans must be treated fairly and expeditiously as they seek compensation for disability or illness
5282789 as president i will do all that is in my power to ensure that those who serve today and those who have served in the past have access to the highest quality health mental health and rehabilitative care in the world
5282790 im not here to tell you that there is a cost that is too high to be paid in the care of our nations veterans
5282791 exactly because funding va programs command bipartisan support some in the congress like to attach unrelated appropriations and earmarks to va bills
5282792 when we make it clear to congress that no earmark bill will be signed into law that will save many billions of dollars that can be applied to essential priorities and above all to the care of our veterans
5282793 my administration will create a veterans care access card to be used by veterans with illness or injury incurred during their military service and by those with lower incomes
5282794 this card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans health care as some have wrongly charged
5282795 even so there are veterans eligible for care who are not currently able to receive it on account of distance wait times or the absence of certain specialties and for this group the new card i propose will offer better alternatives to provide the benefits they have earned
5282796 reform must also recognize that greater care is needed for certain types of injuries
5282797 the va must also broaden its care for the women who are entering the armed forces in greater numbers than ever
5282798 these are among the elements of my reform agenda for the va system
5282799 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage
5282800 as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation
5282801 no one who has worn the uniform of his or her country can ever take these matters lightly
5282802 the next president will have many responsibilities to the american people and i take them all seriously
5282803 it is every veterans hope that should their children be called upon to answer a call to arms the battle will be necessary and the field well chosen
5282804 i am leaving with satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did that with honesty
5282805 i am a human too i could have made mistakes i believe that the people will forgive me and if there were any shortcomings or any mistakes they were unintentional

5282816 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5282817 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5282818 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5282819 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5282820 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5282821 the market could grow more and the rupee could get stronger against the dollar if the country sees good governance in future

5282863 dca needs to do a better job helping the consumers of this city in resolving these types of consumer related disputes so that homeowners are not victimized a second time by the very agency that has the responsibility to protect them from abuses of unscrupulous home improvement contractors it is shameful that this family has been forced to spend thousands of dollars to hire their own engineers to inspect the work and testify at hearings that should have been done by dca inspectors thousands of dollars in lawyers fees to represent them in the dca proceedings and many more thousands of dollars to hire new contractors to repair and complete the work that should have been done by the original contractor
5282864 we have been fighting this battle for almost four years and we thought that the department of consumer affairs was there to help us resolve this matter in a fair way but what we have experienced instead is incompetence ineptitude and injustice
5282865 but i was too young and too short to wear the costume when i found out they were looking for someone to be westy this season i volunteered id grown a lot

5282874 a college degree in theater and years of dance lessons have definitely helped me bring all of the mascots ive been to life
5282875 as for being a baseball mascot i was pretty much thrown into a costume one day when the mascot for the team i was working for at the time didnt show up i didnt really know what i was doing but from that day on i was hooked
5282876 my favorite is convincing a mom or dad to tango across the concourse with me
5282877 ive never gotten seriously hurt but it makes me sad when i hear a parent say to the kids go punch the mascot
5282878 but ive learned a lot by watching other mascots especially disney characters
5282879 i have to drink a lot of water because it gets really hot in the suit
5282880 there are two main rules while im working never take the head off my costume and never speak

5282945 right now id stack our prospects up against anybody elses
5282946 we just think hes the all around type of center that we have been looking for that we dont have
5282947 hes a player that can play in all situations he has good offensive instincts and hes shown that hes a guy that can play defensively and hes shown that he has good size hell be a big strong center which is something we have been coveting
5282948 he made the adjustment from northern michigan and learned about longer schedule and stronger players
5282949 he has good offensive skills and is rounding out his game now the offensive skill set is in place for him and with all that hes learned he could make a big jump were hoping for him
5282950 he makes the people around him better with the way he sees the ice and can make plays his scoring needs to pick up a bit in terms of pace but he can play up to the pace so we think hell move up to the american league next year and the higher tempo will help as he gains leg strength his skating skills will come out
5282951 i think hes in a good situation at notre dame
5282952 his game is only going to continue to develop there
5282953 he had a really good year and jumped up in his production
5282954 hes a good two way guy thats the core of his game he kills penalties blocks shots and has a physical aspect to his game he blossomed on the offensive side this year and should take on more of a leadership role at wisconsin its a year by year analysis with him
5282955 he didnt produce quite as much as he could have his sophomore year but he did score 20 goals as a freshman
5282956 expectations might have been too high but he finished the year strong
5282957 we have him signed and hell be in training camp
5282958 i really believe he will make the predators this year i think he can really be on our team
5282959 the one thing we have never done is rush our prospects because were concerned about them being solid players for us five six seven years from now
5282960 were in a fortunate situation with our d that we dont have to force our guys it would be great if he came in and pushed but our plan right now is for him to go back to vancouver and go back to world juniors with the u s
5282961 our hope is hell push in training camp but if he needs more time so be it
5282962 cody is a big rangy guy who shoots and passes the puck extremely well he learned a lot in terms of the defensive side this year in milwaukee and made strides were looking forward to him coming to camp
5282963 he got good experience playing in a mens league in germany and he was mature coming over
5282964 he had a good year for us but had a groin injury late in the year he was probably our most reliable guy in milwaukee this year with his two way game we definitely see him in our plans
5282965 he has one more year in plymouth and i think with a year under his belt as a starter there and knowing how to carry the load it will pay dividends for him
5282966 i would say hell certainly be in the running for team canada
5282967 he had an excellent year at tri city i think he led the league in wins and played 90 percent of their games he was a real workhorse for them much the way carey price was there are similarities there with his size and his demeanor he doesnt get rattled by much he takes away a lot of net and controls his game pretty well
5282968 we really feel confident that hes ready to play in the nhl hes got future starting possibilities
5282969 we really feel confident that hes ready to play in the nhl
5282970 dek is a little different in that he didnt play junior
5282971 hes a little older because he played college hockey but lets not write him off at all dek is a pro now and hes ready to be a pro i think hes a sleeper

5283695 what sibel revealed to us and has been revealing little by little since january is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the us to procure nuclear designs and parts for the aq khan network and it was done not through pakistani intelligence directly but through the turkish embassy turkish businessmen who got the information and gave it to turkish military attaches who then turned it over to the isi and from there went on to the nuclear black market to procure these parts and designs high government us officials helped facilitate turkish israeli phd students to get into nuclear facilities in the us they worked with the rand corporation as well some moles with rand to help get this information there was at least one american company giza technologies that was helping with parts probably there were others and this thing went on from 1995 at least until 2002 and it could still be going on when this operation was shut down by the dept of defense and the state dept now sibel tells us that high government officials inside those two departments defense and state were involved in this ring she has named them on her website at least she has not named them she has photographs of people other bloggers have named them
5283696 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy

5283724 assets and income of public officials which may be materially affected by their official actions should be disclosed and in appropriate circumstances the officials should be disqualified from acting in order that conflicts of interest may be avoided
5283725 no public official at any level of state or local government shall make participate in making or in any way attempt to use his official position to influence a governmental decision in which he knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest
5283726 for most other officials including employees of state and local government agencies it is up to the agencies that employ them to decide what their disclosure requirements are

5283745 the crisis in the housing market is spreading like cancer and all the evidence suggests that scotland is now infected growth in the scottish housing market has ground to a halt
5283746 if the first minister stops dithering and takes control he can help a construction industry under massive strain so that it can survive to build more private and affordable housing in the future
5283747 by doing so he can also help address the chronic shortage of affordable and social housing in scotlands communities
5283748 this is an important test for the first minister the time to act is now less spin and more action thats what scotland expects
5283749 we recognise that developments in the credit markets will have a significant adverse effect on house building over the short to medium term

5283796 i had been working on infrared reflection spectroscopy for medical imaging when andrew approached me about a possible collaboration i thought that this would be perfect for the frogs it can show us what is happening in the frogs skin but it is non invasive
5283797 this is a great example of novel and exciting interdisciplinary research that draws on expertise right across the university
5283798 with a third of the worlds amphibians currently under threat its vitally important we do our utmost to investigate the reasons why they are dying out at such an alarming rate
5283799 the imaging techniques we use do not harm the frogs in any way as an animal conservationist i simply would not allow any research that distressed these amazing creatures

5283808 bengal government should strive create a separate state of gorkhaland in a conducive environment it will be wise on their part and proper to create gorkhaland in a friendly environment
5283809 this will result in good relations between gorkhaland and west bengal
5283810 our main demand is gorkhaland and this political demand should be solved politically our demand is within the ambits of the constitution
5283811 bhattacharya is nobody to reject gorkhaland it is the responsibility of the centre to give gorkhaland
5283812 people have come out in open for community rather than party our solution is only gorkhaland
5283813 since all parties in sikkim are in favour of gorkhaland and agrees that the sikkim government should play a proactive role sikkim should take the lead and be the first state pass a resolution in the assembly before any other states does it
5283814 in other states we are almost near to get similar resolutions passed
5283815 its a part of the democratic process to approach an elected government for a representation we should send the resolution collectively under the banner of parisangh
5283816 language recognition was not easy because it was not constitutionally binding but gorkhaland demand is valid as there are constitutional provisions for creation of separate states
5283817 the proposed gorkhaland territory should give leadership to all the indian gorkhas living in the nation
5283818 if bgp does not take into its fold all the parties and organizations of gorkhaland demand then there will be doubts raised whether the movement will be fruitful
5283819 the bgps guardian role is important so that our demands are institutionalized and we reach the ears of delhi through the parisangh
5283820 i feel that nobody from sikkim will back out from supporting the gorkhaland demand
5283821 the bgp should prepare a proper documentation justifying the gorkhaland demand to the delhi leader
5283822 bgp has nationwide network but we are not using it
5283823 it will not be successful unless it becomes a national issue
5283824 we should take good qualities of ghisingh and use him in the movement and not treat him like his is being treated presently
5283825 the mass have no minds but leaders should be able to control the masses
5283826 we will take action against illegal mining the new mining policy which is in the draft state will address the issue

5283850 musharraf was a little more pragmatic than his predecessors if we look at his exit purely from viewpoint of its bearing on the kashmir issue its bad news for india
5283851 moreover we dont know how long will the unity between asif zardari co chairman of pakistan peoples party and nawaz sharif head of pakistan muslim league nawaz last it also remains to be seen how stable this coalition will be
5283852 in such a situation there is every chance that kashmir will become an issue in party politics with each side trying to outdo the other by more hawkish postures on kashmir
5283853 musharraf was a little more reasonable on kashmir but his formulations were something india could not accept
5283854 the peace process is also likely to slow down due to domestic political preoccupations in pakistan
5283855 we dont really know who is in control and whether they can rein in forces inimical to indian interests

5283883 there should be clear and comprehensive rehabilitation programmes for these juveniles either inside the prisons or when they get out
5283884 even the strongest person becomes mush when the topic turns to raises
5283885 just remember that your boss will also be uncomfortable talking about it with you
5283886 you could be the organizations powerpoint guru or possess some skill that everyone comes to you for help with
5283887 what you are effectively doing is running a marketing campaign for yourself you want to make sure youve got visibility with people other than your boss
5283888 a script will help you feel comfortable that you can objectively prove your worth to the organization
5283889 if a companys policy is to give annual raises its hard to get an exception to the rule
5283890 usually decisions come from senior management and your boss wont have any latitude to go outside the companys policy
5283891 the average person usually cant step aside from his or her emotions
5283892 also your manager may go on the defensive if you ask for a larger raise during your review
5283893 if your manager asks you what raise you have in mind you dont want to gasp and go blank
5283894 if you were offered a 3 percent raise you cant ask for 7 percent it just wont happen
5283895 if you got a 3 percent raise but want a 5 percent raise say ive accomplished xyz i possess xyz skills i put in extra time at the office and im a bit disappointed with the raise
5283896 be sure to use an i message rather than a you message it sounds less accusatory
5283897 it also may put you on top of the layoff list
5283898 talking about what someone else received really tends to turn a boss off

5284113 yaitu tanggal 19 desember 2007 karena pada tanggal itu idul adha dirayakan di arab saudi dan negara negara sekitarnya padahal hal ini perlu ditinjau kembali
5284114 dan ketahuilah bahwasanya waktu wukuf di arafah itu antara zawal tergelincir matahari pada hari arafah yaitu tanggal 9 dari bulan dzulhijjah hingga terbitnya fajar pada hari nahar
5284115 dan puasa arafah yaitu tanggal sembilan dari bulan dzulhijjah yang menghapus dosa dua tahun
5284116 al maziri ditanya tentang puasa tanggal sembilan dzulhijjah jika diragukan adalah hari nahar
5284117 sabda beliau dan arafah serta asyura penamaan ini dan diisyaratkan dengan sabda beliau sebagaimana penamaan lainnya asyura dan nishfu syaban nama kapan puasa dan selain puasa dituntut untuk dilakukan waktu itu
5284118 dan yang kedua dari hadits abu hurairah dan hari arafah bagi selain jamaah haji adalah tanggal sembilan dari bulan dzulhijjah dan asyura yaitu tanggal sepuluh dari bulan muharram
5284119 adapun hari arafah adalah hari kesembilan dari bulan dzulhijjah kami tidak mengetahui adalah perbedaan pendapat tentang itu karena wukuf di arafah dilakukan saat itu
5284120 adapun hari arafah adalah hari kesembilan dari bulan dzulhijjah dinamakan demikian karena wukuf di arafah dilakukan saat itu
5284121 wahai amirul mukminin kami keliru menghitung menurut kami hari ini adalah hari arafah

5284128 but its a good opportunity to practice like it was the big one
5284129 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5284130 when we looked at the domain parking business we realized that visitors to domains would have a much better user experience if they were directed to the best websites in the world instead of landing on a parking page
5284131 domain owners no matter how much they try can never build up the kind of brand recognition that a travelocity has
5284132 so we thought the traffic would do better if it flowed to them and that a market based approach where there was competitive bidding would also help domain owners earn the most possible money the advertisers that can benefit the most from the traffic would be the ones who would bid the most
5284133 weve been seeing really great results we learned that the model of advertisers paying for every visitor not just the ones that click has worked very well we created a lot of technology to optimize the matching of domains with the right kinds of advertisers we also uitilize a system that advertisers are familiar with by letting them bid on keywords that made it easier to get advertisers onboard and bidding on our traffic
5284134 over the last few weeks we have brought in some of the premier generic domain names we are extremely selective about the domains that we work with and we go after very specific domains in relation to who we have signed up on the advertising side
5284135 we can approach a portfolio holder and say you have five really great domains that would work well with advertiser a b and c and sort of grow the relationship from there they see michael feeley sendori director of business development that we outperform parking by a pretty large margin and they end up wanting to bring over the rest of their portfolio
5284136 there have been some big changes and it looks like even bigger changes are coming down the pipeline that will put a hurting on a lot of these guys so they are looking for a new home
5284137 what ilike about our model is that it has total transparency
5284138 you know exactly who is advertising on your domain you know who is paying your bills and that is something that has been missing its true that we are still somewhat of a middleman but the domain owners revenue share is still a lot less diluted than it is with parking
5284139 we think you are going to see some strong end user sales transactions down the line through sendori
5284140 with the stats we also know how much to sell the traffic for as we are obviously not going to sell it for less than what you are already making some of the bigger domain owners are hesitant to share their stats with anyone but if they will take that step we can make more money for them
5284141 we have to look at the owners names and see what might sync up with our advertisers to determine what we would be interested in where we are going to shine is where we have an advertiser match so that is where we concentrate our efforts
5284142 companies like that can offer more for domains than other buyers because they have the most to gain from owning them or advertising through them
5284143 because we offer complete transparency they can see exactly where conversions are coming from and they can weed out anything that is under performing our reports update hourly so they can see exactly what is going on the transparency we have is not something they get with google and yahoo weve also found that advertisers are always willing to try something new if they can measure it so we made sure we built something that they can measure
5284144 it has been very exciting to see what happens when you match a great domain with a great advertiser the value that is created
5284145 we are seeing very high conversion rates in come cases 30 or more and it is fun to watch that happen
5284146 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
5284147 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
5284148 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
5284149 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
5284150 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
5284151 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
5284152 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
5284153 thank you press and thank you san francisco you guys made our night and day and many many days and years impossible to forget

5284158 priyadarshan has the ability to lift ordinary stories and make them into great films he was dying to do this one we will make marginal changes keeping the indian sentiments in mind our kind of storytelling is different our canvas is bigger and so are our locations
5284159 its a big deal for us we have bought the rights of the film we have been working on it for a year we are happy that we will be making an honest film that has tremendous potential in our market we indians love films that are emotional and traditional our huge middle class will have a sure shot connect with the film

5284163 basically in china people are free to say their opinions
5284164 as long as you dont organize if you organize youre likely to get in trouble
5284165 if you compare chinese responses against those of other asian societies there is a considerable degree of criticalness expressed about political and civil rights
5284166 focus on established democracies we know much less about what people think about human rights in democratizing or authoritarian countries
5284167 if citizens dont have accurate information about actual political conditions it is difficult to offer a meaningful or even critical opinion
5284168 anything that challenges the notion of building this great strong china
5284169 political authorities have swept under the rug theyre using the glory and prestige of the olympics to show chinese citizens and the world that china is strong and to further legitimize their continued rule over the country
5284170 theyve unleashed this event the question is how much longer can the communist party keep accurate information about domestic political conditions and the outside world from getting in

5284182 the legal cases between oklahoma and arkansas evolved from a conflict over point source pollution involving municipal wastewater discharge to a conflict over nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrient runoff from poultry litter
5284183 in light of three decades or more of significant structural changes in the animal agricultural production system this shift from point source to nonpoint source mirrors the evolution of how water quality has been addressed since the enactment of clean water act
5284184 discernable confined and discrete conveyances including any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well from which pollutants may be discharged
5284185 a consequence of these structural changes is that extraordinary amounts of animal waste are produced in geographically limited areas
5284186 this waste must be disposed of or utilized somehow and a traditional and common method is for producers to apply it to the land as fertilizer
5284187 policymakers may begin to consider new policy approaches to addressing nonpoint source pollution particularly if they conclude that addressing the issue through region based litigation may not be the most effective tool to address a national issue the thought might be that perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation
5284188 linking this approach with some type of comprehensive watershed management system may be a new paradigm in which policymakers can address nonpoint source pollution from agriculture
5284189 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama

5284217 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5284218 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5284219 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5284220 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

5284227 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5284228 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5284229 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5284230 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5284231 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5284232 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5284233 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5284234 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

5284237 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5284238 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5284239 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5284240 het devies bij deze wedstrijd was heel blijven en geen schade oplopen dat is gelukt ik heb maartje paumen en janneke schopman veel rust kunnen geven dat is een goed teken

5284242 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5284243 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5284244 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5284245 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5284246 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5284247 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5284248 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5284249 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5284250 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5284251 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5284252 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5284253 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5284254 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5284255 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5284256 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5284257 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5284258 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5284259 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5284260 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5284261 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5284262 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5284263 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5284264 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5284265 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5284266 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5284267 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5284268 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5284269 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5284270 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5284271 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5284272 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5284273 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5284274 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5284275 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5284276 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5284277 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5284278 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5284282 i am a human too i could have made mistakes but i believe that the people will forgive me
5284283 historically there has been a close correlation between actual production in electronics sector and exports of electronics
5284284 recently we noticed that this gap has been widening which then means either domestic consumption of electronics is high because its not being exported but retail sales do not support that this means inventories are being built up
5284285 with oil prices easing a little bit maybe global demand doesnt have to continue slowing so steeply after all it was high oil prices as we realize here in singapore that put a pinch on household budgets and corporate bottom lines

5284287 weve done some investigation and found out that the installation failure in this case may actually be caused by the computer configuration which in most cases can be easily changed to allow for successful installation and functionality of windows search 4 0
5284288 in this case when ws4 0 runs under windows server 2003 or windows xp it requires terminal services to be running by default terminal services are set to start automatically in windows xp and windows server 2003 however system administrator or third party software may have chosen to disable them in order to enable installation and subsequent functionality of windows search 4 0 on your machine you need to have terminal services running first
5284289 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5284290 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5284291 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5284292 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5284293 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5284294 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5284295 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5284296 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5284297 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
5284298 every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
5284299 its the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
5284300 have somebody stand up for somebody have me as a man who ended a relationship stand up for somebody write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated woman ive ever met people are different people have different chemistry they have different lives its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out youre either a cheater or you break up and im not the first im the second one and thats it theres no lying theres no bullshit i just dont want to be followed around ny city like an animal
5284301 why did you ask me that question im being as honest as i can possibly be and youre asking questions that belie what im saying
5284302 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5284303 blustered that he would handle the human rights issue as an element for negotiations with north korea
5284304 we categorically dismiss this as a premeditated act of the u s to deliberately throw a hurdle in the process of the six party talks
5284305 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist
5284306 we are pleased to deepen this relationship and are confident that this transaction will create long term value for mufg shareholders while creating new opportunities for unionbancal employees and customers

5284330 is it too much of a stretch to think that an evangelical christian would make sure a republican candidate had the questions beforehand
5284331 the victims were all very poor people living in old and dilapidated buildings
5284332 so far we have received reports about the partial or full collapse of as many as 890 houses

5284337 who knows what causes normally composed well adjusted sane people to become quietly or in some cases not so quietly unhinged maybe as happened the other evening at jean georges vongerichtens latest experiment in international cuisine matsugen its pretty much everything
5284338 to provide the necessary big restaurant heft and cash flow the matsushitas have added a hodgepodge of options including workmanlike tempura pricey uninspired sushi even a ridiculously effete version of shabu shabu we called for some sushi which was professionally made but would have been better if the uni hadnt tasted several days too old the seared fatty tuna belly was insipid and ridiculously expensive
5284339 this zenlike touch has a minimal effect on the fractured boxy space and the new restaurants identity is featureless and opaque
5284340 then theres the shabu shabu which is hoisted to the table like a camping kit with raw ingredients a pot of tepid water and the portable gas burner i didnt have the nerve to pay 160 for a taste of boiled wagyu beef my friend the steak loon did
5284341 it might be the greatest waste of good beef in history

5284350 middle ear nerve damage may play a role in affecting taste in children with recurrent ear infections or chronic ear disease who get drainage tubes this damage may increase intake of fattening foods
5284351 there was a trend but not significant for recurrent ear infection to lead to overweight
5284352 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
5284353 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
5284354 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections
5284355 taste does have an impact on selection of food and diet
5284356 a tonsillectomy may damage one of the nerves that carry taste information in addition ear infections can also alter taste altering taste does have an effect on the preferences for food
5284357 it certainly makes sense that variations in taste due to many factors including a history of ear infections could influence food preferences total food intake and weight

5284362 no one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of god
5284363 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 35for whoever wants to save his life a will lose it but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it 36what good is it for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul 37or what can a man give in exchange for his soul 38if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his fathers glory with the holy angels
5284364 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service

5284407 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5284408 i wasnt expressing an opinion i was reporting what they were saying
5284409 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5284410 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning non partisan coverage of the presidential race
5284411 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5284412 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5284415 limitations exist on the authority of staff to deal with regional business during a hiatus in the sitting of council
5284416 these limitations may prove problematic in dealing with certain large scale and time sensitive capital projects in these circumstances the establishment of a committee with full authority to deal with such matters is proposed
5284417 in order to deal with this challenge during this summer and for the remainder of councils term it is proposed to establish an interim period approvals committee which could be convened at the call of the chair and would have delegated to it councils full authority to make decisions which would be beyond the authority of staff
5284418 what were looking for today is some evidence that would signal to us that there is an underlying heart problem
5284419 there are things that we can pick up with an electrocardiogram or with echocardiography that we may need to follow and in some cases could be career ending
5284420 if you walk into a medical facility and request these same tests you would spend well over a thousand dollars
5284421 it will take a period of three hours my physicals usually take 15 minutes
5284422 there are many kids who come here and never really had a complete physical exam let alone an echocardiogram or an ekg
5284423 just like a used car you can shine it up but none of us think twice about buying it unless we took it for a test drive and had a mechanic look at it
5284424 it just measures the electrical voltage that your heart puts out the thing we look for here is your heart rhythm is it normal
5284425 so youve passed this first leg of the heart screening
5284426 were looking for abnormal heart thickening meaning a portion of the heart wall is thicker than another
5284427 you always wonder if somethings wrong its better to find out early than find out later
5284428 i havent skied near 8 400 points in two years so this is really good
5284429 i came here with a goal to get a really nice score i could have added more tricks and gotten a bigger score but in the preliminaries i wasnt quite on so i didnt want to take that risk
5284430 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5284431 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5284432 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5284433 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5284434 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5284435 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5284436 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5284437 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5284438 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5284439 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5284440 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5284441 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5284442 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
5284443 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go
5284444 all of a sudden we heard this big thud we knew someone was hurt and when we came back around we saw him lying on the ground
5284445 i got a blanket jumped on top of him we did everything we could to save him he had a pulse
5284446 south ossetian president eduard kokoity has dismissed the government of the georgian breakaway republic and proclaimed a one month state of emergency his spokesman said on monday

5284448 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5284449 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5284450 i kind of felt like i let the tournament slip away on 10 and 11
5284451 i told myself on the next tee box i got my momentum

5284523 he definitely taught me as an individual that its not always about yourself its about the team
5284524 this is where he was born you know with running at least
5284525 he was the type of kid that when you talked to him he looked you straight in the eye
5284526 gabe really lit up our life as an individual and as a person
5284527 we wanted to light up his life and give him a way to see the track again
5284528 it has been good for the three players to be involved in the olympics and we are proud of them

5284530 zenit asked for 19 7million for the transfer of arshavin
5284531 this is the last price of the team four days ago in a private meeting with one of the tottenham representatives it was take it or leave it that is the last price
5284532 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5284533 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5284534 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5284535 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there

5284539 the real concerns are people driving 4 000 pound machines that have the ability to kill pedestrians cyclists and people in wheelchairs
5284540 in 22 years of commuting to oakland i have never seen a cyclist stop at a red light or stop sign
5284541 theres a physics argument on why some bikers dont stop at stop signs
5284542 i dont see why bikes are special and not subject to the speed limit
5284543 it is my intention to make sure everyone understands those laws
5284544 you have to trust the veteran guys the last thing we need to do is have a guy who has got an injury who has proven he can play and push him into it early and have it turn into a chronic deal
5284545 it wouldnt be the best approach for every team especially coming off the injuries we came off at the end of last season if you come in and everybody goes and never misses a practice some guys get beat up and were right back not starting off fresh
5284546 obviously if you get hurt in a preseason game it affects your chances in the regular season
5284547 were a veteran team but everyone needs to get on the field get out there and tackle go full go
5284548 during practice we go fast tempo but there is not a lot of contact its big for us to be out there in a game

5284552 the objectives are to obtain the maximum number of titles
5284553 there will of course be pressure but it is challenge for all the players and the coach
5284554 i believe that we will be able to do it we will obtain one as a minimum
5284555 i believe there are similarities the sensations of the team in pre season the dynamics of the play the winning character the pressure that well be under these situations lead me to believe that this year will go very well
5284556 i am in one of the better parts of my career
5284557 to win the european championships and to be named best player of the championship has given me a lot of confidence in confronting this new season
5284558 as a player he was very methodical and meticulous he liked to order a lot and to have everything under control he is a person that talks a lot and i am very pleased to have known pep as a player and now as a coach
5284559 that season was perhaps the best i have ever had at barca rijkaard pushed me forward 15 metres i felt i could be more significant i improved a lot in front of goal and i had extraordinary players in front of me
5284560 use of a collective voice that embraced black and white concerns
5284561 negotiations will continue under the facilitation of south african president thabo mbeki we hope a deal can be finalized in the fullness of time

5284563 i leave my future in the hands of the people

5284565 people will never pardon this government if they fail to do so

5284619 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5284669 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5284670 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5284671 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5284672 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5284673 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5284674 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5284675 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5284676 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando

5284682 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5284683 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5284684 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5284723 as china projects a new air of openness and tolerance as it rolls out the welcome mat for olympics visitors the government is cracking down on citizens
5284724 what if things do not go the way we hope they will
5284725 i think all of us who entered iraq expected the job of actually discovering deployed weapons to be easier than it has turned out to be
5284726 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
5284727 iraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction wmd programs in defiance of un resolutions and restrictions baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of un restrictions if left unchecked it probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade
5284728 since inspections ended in 1998 iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort energized its missile program and invested more heavily in biological weapons most analysts assess that iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program
5284729 if baghdad acquires sufficient weapons grade fissile material from abroad it could make a nuclear weapon within a year without such material from abroad iraq probably would not be able to make a weapon until the last half of the decade
5284730 baghdad has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents probably including mustard sarin cyclosarin and vx saddam probably has stocked a few hundred metric tons of cw agents
5284731 all key aspects r amp d production and weaponization of iraqs offensive bw biological warfare program are active and most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war baghdad has established a large scale redundant and concealed bw agent production capability which includes mobile facilities these facilities can evade detection are highly survivable and can exceed the production rates iraq had prior to the gulf war
5284732 there is a problem the probable possession of weapons of mass destruction by an uncontrollable country iraq the international community is right in having decided iraq should be disarmed
5284733 this clandestine capability was suitable for preserving bw expertise bw capable facilities and continuing r amp d all key elements for maintaining a capability for resuming bw production
5284734 detainees and cooperative sources indicate that beginning in 2000 saddam ordered the development of ballistic missiles with ranges of at least 240 miles and up to 620 miles and that measures to conceal these projects from un inspectors were initiated in late 2002 ahead of the arrival of inspectors
5284735 the facility was instructed to remove evidence of the true activities at the facility evacuate documents to hide sites make physical alterations to the site to hide its true purpose develop cover stories and conduct mock inspections to prepare for un inspectors
5284736 if the world tells us to abandon all our weapons and keep only swords we will do that we will destroy all the weapons if they destroy their weapons but if they keep a rifle and then tell me that i have the right to possess only a sword then we would say no as long as the rifle has become a means to defend our country against anybody who may have designs against it then we will try our best to acquire the rifle
5284737 why did you rely on this source and not this other piece of information
5284738 please explain the history of iraqs association with the organization you mention in this sentence
5284739 today saddam hussein has the scientists and infrastructure for a nuclear weapons program and has illicitly sought to purchase the equipment needed to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon should his regime acquire fissile material it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year
5284740 if the iraqi regime is able to produce buy or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year
5284741 we estimate that once iraq acquires fissile material whether from a foreign source or by securing the materials to build an indigenous fissile material capability it could fabricate a nuclear weapon within one year
5284742 the judgment in the nie was that if saddam could acquire fissile material weapons grade material that he would have a nuclear weapon within a few months to a year that was the judgment of the intelligence community of the united states and they had a high degree of confidence in it
5284743 many problems have not been solved not even by the united nations and some want them to be solved during the olympic games putting pressure on the international olympic committee and the beijing olympic committee wang said

5284761 when it first happened it looked like the plane would go straight down but the pilot recovered it and seemed to be in control of it
5284762 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5284763 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry
5284764 when i arrived here there was a lot of bystanders indicating that a collision had occurred
5284765 a search took place and we did locate two scenes of wreckage one towards coventry and one in brandon wood approximately one mile apart
5284766 we are conducting a joint investigation with the air accidents investigation branch and warwickshire fire and rescue service to try to find out what has happened
5284767 there are two scenes and they are difficult to get to we are appealing for anyone who witnessed the crash to get in touch
5284768 we looked up and it looked like lots of confetti falling out of the sky
5284769 a twin engined plane then came toward us falling all the time it was going to hit us or could have gone on to the housing estate in binley by morrisons
5284770 but i think the pilot must have realised what was going to happen because the plane then banked very very sharply like they do in those acrobatic displays
5284771 its sad especially in the sense that they operated out of coventry which is a small community and we all know most of the people
5284772 although they have not been named when they are named i suspect we will find that we know them
5284773 our condolences go out to not just the families but also their work colleagues
5284774 its more normal to have two pilots and one operator but sometimes its helpful to have a second person to assist and quite often pilots go along to help out if they are free
5284775 im delighted that so many people came out on their bikes to enjoy hackneys parks and green spaces cycling is fun good for the environment and a great way to keep fit
5284776 i am delighted to be here thanks to the chartered institute of housing for organising this seminar and for the interest of everybody here
5284777 as you have very likely gathered we are launching a green paper on welfare reform
5284778 in 1997 there were a little over five and a half million people of working age on the out of work benefits jobseekers allowance incapacity benefits lone parents on income support
5284779 but one part of the system has remained until very recently unreformed and yet many people see it as key to explaining why such a large number of people still are trapped on benefit instead of being in work its housing benefit and its time now to work out what we are going to do with it
5284780 so in the budget alistair darling announced a comprehensive review of housing benefit for working age customers my department will be working closely with the treasury and with the department for communities and local government
5284781 of course one big change to housing benefit has recently been introduced the local housing allowance rolled out nationally in april is a very significant change for tenants in the private rented sector it gives a clear signal of the direction we see reform moving in the future
5284782 for the first time the local housing allowance places responsibility for paying rent and handling benefit payments firmly in the hands of the customer
5284783 most housing benefit has always been paid automatically to landlords because that was easier for all concerned too often housing benefit entirely passed the tenant by the tenant had no responsibility at all for paying the rent
5284784 the new system has changed that requiring privately renting tenants who receive local housing allowance to take responsibility for their own affairs
5284785 eighty four per cent of customers in the lha pathfinder areas were able to manage their benefit payments themselves and pay their rent reliably
5284786 the lha also means for the first time that new customers know in advance how much benefit they will receive and can make the sort of informed choices over accommodation that other families have to make
5284787 the lha applies only to private rented tenants the benefits of choice and responsibility are not available to most of the eighty per cent of housing benefit customers in the social sector we need to consider how the lessons of the lha can be transferred to them too
5284788 it wont be easy tenants in the social sector suffer greater disadvantage on average than those in the private sector and tend to need more help around half of working age tenants in the social sector are unemployed or inactive
5284789 but that makes the need for reform all the more pressing
5284790 but we need to do more to give independence and control so people can take advantage of the opportunities on offer when as in this months employment figures we have more people in jobs in britain than we have ever had before
5284791 our ambitions to raise employment to 80 from 75 today to move a million people off incapacity benefits to help 300 000 lone parents and one million older people into work
5284792 we propose increasing the expectation of people on the employment and support allowance who could work and of people on jobseekers allowance to take increasingly active steps towards finding a job
5284793 delays in paying claims present huge problems even more so for those moving into short term or irregular work
5284794 we have agreed with hm revenue and customs and the local government association to roll these processes out nationally by the end of 2009 we will announce local authorities in the first phase after the summer
5284795 so what exactly are the problems we are trying to solve the most obvious is sheer complexity a result of the tough demands we make on the system
5284796 we demand a lot from customers in telling us about their circumstances how much money they have coming in and who lives in their household
5284797 much complexity is so we can target help at those most in need but i am convinced we can devise a system that cuts out unnecessary complication whilst maintaining or perhaps boosting fairness
5284798 and to those who suggest that the solution is to put the clock back 25 years and re centralise housing support lets not forget that local authorities are also ideally placed to provide the support services people need best delivered locally
5284799 and yet there is still too much variation in the standard of administration across the country while the quickest local authorities process a new claim in little over a week others are taking six weeks
5284800 i want a much clearer focus on the key elements of good administration efficiency good customer service low fraud and error value for money for the taxpayer
5284801 i have an open mind at this stage about the direction that reforms will take we are prepared to look at all the options i have no doubt you will have options to propose and i will welcome your ideas
5284802 i also want to be clear about the impetus behind this review clear about the purpose of housing benefit about what it is that we want from the scheme
5284803 too few customers today receive their benefit themselves or can exercise choice over where they live or how much of their benefit they pay in rent housing benefit is passive it doesnt fit with our wider welfare reform plans we are announcing today and it needs to
5284804 i am convinced we can give people far more control than they have at the moment far more responsibility for managing their own financial affairs and far more choice in finding decent affordable housing
5284805 i think we can do more about equalising the way tenants in different types of tenure are treated
5284806 in an active benefit system customers need to be given greater opportunities to balance their choices with responsibilities we want to promote mixed communities too but we need to ask whether communities made up of the rich and of benefit recipients are really what we mean
5284807 housing benefit is to ensure that people on low incomes have access to decent housing that core purpose will stay
5284808 but beyond that how does housing benefit help people into work how does it helps them exercise choice and responsibility is it fair is its administration efficient and good value for money the review of housing benefit will look at all those questions
5284809 we want people to be able to take greater control in managing money and saving for the future housing benefit should be helping
5284810 the idea that housing benefit is merely a means of transferring cash from the state to the customer with no strings attached cannot be sustained welfare is no longer delivered to the individual passively by the state without conditions
5284811 so we have begun to address the most pressing problems with housing benefit
5284812 there is more to do i have outlined evident problems and some of the factors driving reform but i am not yet offering answers the four tests we need to apply to housing benefit are simple
5284813 those are the questions we will be applying during this review and considering what changes we need to make to get us better answers to them than the ones we have today

5284840 i became a really bad alcoholic in the navy it was part of the culture it was accepted
5284841 my life just completely utterly went out of control in every way that you can think of i was 22 years old and i just didnt know if i was going to make it and not just if id make it in society i didnt know if id make it another year living i was surrounded by people who were involved in everything you could think of from drugs to dealing to every bad element that you can think of in this town
5284842 even though id been in rehab before and it had done me no good
5284843 i went there on oct 1 by oct 10 i was sitting there in a service and i gave my life back to god
5284844 he just got a hold of me and i could sense him sense his voice hear him i went up to the front of the church and i said god look i will give my life to you whatever im worth if im worth anything im giving myself to you
5284845 they laid hands on me and they prayed and instantaneously i saw myself standing on a platform in my minds eye speaking to people hundreds of people thousands of people
5284846 and i got mad i got really really angry because all these guys were talking about their experiences with god with hands touching them and i went back to my seat and i was angry i said to god when i sat down i cant stay clean i cant manage my life its a mess everything i try fails and i try to give my life to you and you show me this vision of me leading people i cant even lead myself
5284847 there are just some people that need to be not to prove who you are but to be
5284848 the sense that he gave me that day was youve been radical in everything that you do im the most aggressive person in everything i do im the most aggressive basketball player youll see on the court i was the most aggressive person in the military in the war games i was the dude that was infiltrating the camp everything about me was that way so he just gave me a sense shane you just cant be that guy who just goes to church on sunday you cant be the guy who just changes your life it wont work im going to help you change your life so you can change everything around you
5284849 this is me were talking about here chris you remember me in school
5284850 i didnt want to come back here i never thought id be back here
5284851 the bible says that a prophet is not without honor except in his hometown but when id come back home to see my family id drive by that building on delphine and say to myself we could do something special there
5284852 the only room that was being used for ministry was the sanctuary
5284853 the rest of the rooms were just being rented out by the owner and you could literally see a cloud of darkness i dont want to be superspiritual but you could sense that it was death police were in and out of there raiding the place at any given time
5284854 it started with me my wife and another couple four of us and just grew from there
5284855 the lost sheep people who love god but hate church
5284856 they love god but theyve been hurt by the politics and the organization and the stuff that just happens in churches
5284857 ive been part of megachurches down south with five ten fifteen thousand people so he started speaking to me its become for the ministry a situation where people come and sit in the pews and give and sustain the ministry he said to me i dont want you to do that shane he said i want you to build something that the ministry is for the people
5284858 the bikers arent here today theyre out visiting another church so it wont be quite as rowdy as usual
5284859 the appeal to this type of church is just the realness of it the rawness of it rather than there just being all these facades and faces people acting a certain way because its sunday morning you just come as you are you dont have to act like somebody youre not you can just be yourself
5284860 not everybody is going to be drawn to our church people who were raised in church all their life is not going to typically feel comfortable with a service like ours because its not the norm but for people who havent been in a church and dont know what its supposed to be like its their first taste of it and they like it they can accept it
5284861 we definitely have to wake up early in the morning get some coffee get the vocal chords stretched out so we can hit those notes
5284862 the vision is a church where the broken people are celebrated uplifted and empowered the purpose is all about the people broken people
5284863 i was sitting at home getting ready to go to virginia beach to shoot somebody over a bad debt
5284864 god done it through a friend god through a friend he told me he knew a better place for me he told me he knew a better way for me and a better place for me and that was revolution church
5284865 every sunday if im not doing something with the motorcycle ministry im in the church
5284866 i do everything for god and god says for me to reach out to other people a lot of my friends who see me now and knew me before they still have a problem understanding me but the more they see me the easier it gets my mission is to win souls to jesus and shane keeps me guided in the right direction with gods guidance
5284867 i had a parishioner the other day come and tell me ive heard all this stuff about you pastor and i told this person who was telling me all these things about you no theres no way thats true about my pastor
5284868 i looked that person right in the eye and i said i dont know what that person said but im just going to tell you its probably safe to say that every bit of it is true i dont know what they said but every bit of it is true i have made so many mistakes had so many failures but i am not that man the bible says you are a new creation im not that man im not my mistakes a person who is divorced theyre not a divorcee we label people by their mistakes
5284869 ill admit it i was skeptical about starting here but god told me shane the only way this is going to work is if youre willing to scream your failures from the mountaintops as much as your successes
5284870 we do also reach people who are not in that place of being lost but they want to be a part of a church thats doing something
5284871 so if you come in if somebody comes in to visit im in a suit and tie i look like a businessman and around me up at the front the most vocal people theyre in leather they roll in on their harleys and theyre in chaps and leather youve got that group youve got the group over here thats dressed up youve got another group thats in blue jeans and t shirts thats what revolution is to us
5284872 we need to have a revolution in our personal lives
5284873 we need a personal revolution we also need a spiritual revolution and a social revolution thats the way i define it and revolutions are done at the grassroots people who have a cause every great movement in america started with a revolution martin luther king jr started a revolution he put his life at risk and he put himself out there
5284874 we will have failed if all we do is come here every sunday and nobody on that side of town
5284875 we want to do something about the addiction to crystal meth
5284876 we need to get involved we cant just keep to ourselves here and hope that everything is better one day we have to make it happen
5284877 we need to get this city to understand that you cant abandon people for this ministry to be effective it has to be able to effect change and thats the first thing i want us to do
5284878 a religious revolution waynesboro church turns tradition on its head
5284879 david bottenfield said we needed to mark off this date the 16th of august for paint the valley blue that we were going to have a little
5284880 if virginia has 57 million barrels of oil available and it is not in the cue to be used and we use 20 million a day from some source then the 57 will extend what we have
5284881 david bottenfield said we needed to mark off this date the 16th of august for paint the valley blue that we were going to have a little
5284882 if virginia has 57 million barrels of oil available and it is not in the cue to be used and we use 20 million a day from some source then the 57 will extend what we have
5284883 hopefully well have retained many of the things that make life in this area so special which is very friendly communities that are livable communities that are walkable that you dont have to get into a car to drive across the county to go to the doctors office or to the grocery store that you still know your neighbors and that you still have open spaces and that weve retained the beauty of whats here weve got that vision its down there its in our comprehensive plan
5284884 now were in a situation where we will be far less persnickety in who comes because people are seeing the value of having a manufacturing base
5284885 it hurts the hajocas who were selling them piping it hurts the electric contractors who were helping them it hurts the water and sewer fees that staunton was receiving it is a ripple effect that goes throughout the economy and its not going to be long before the building supply houses are closing because we dont have the construction industry that we once had right now and for the foreseeable future until we start shoring up our manufacturing we will be very receptive
5284886 the county is truly in my opinion a suburban county already its preposterous to think that augusta county thinks of itself as a sleepy little county
5284887 and id be driving somewhere that i hadnt been for a year or two and id say to myself where are all of these houses coming from
5284888 the county is going to have to take a really hard nosed look at their comprehensive plan and where they say agriculture they have to mean agriculture and were not even going to think about rezoning for housing or industrial instead of just this willy nilly well maybe this would be alright if it was industrial you have to look at the big picture sometimes and say we want to force development in this area because then we can provide the services for it
5284889 the real question that comes up to us is can we provide in a competitive nature can we provide the quality of life that people are looking for
5284890 what i see as the major question is how do we compete against other places to provide that quality of life and we have to recognize that the arts and theater and health care and schools are important
5284891 a vibrant city one that is absolutely nurtured from the east end to the west end of town one that is comprehensive in nature in terms of development taking advantage of our river taking advantage of the blue ridge parkway and also making sure that were nurturing the commercial and industrial sector of our community i just see a well rounded community thats well supported has a healthy tax base and a bright future
5284892 2025 vision what does greater augusta look like in the future
5284893 david bottenfield said we needed to mark off this date the 16th of august for paint the valley blue that we were going to have a little
5284894 if virginia has 57 million barrels of oil available and it is not in the cue to be used and we use 20 million a day from some source then the 57 will extend what we have
5284895 if we can make our comprehensive plans work i think well certainly have many more people but hopefully well have retained many of the things that make life in this area so special which are very friendly communities that are livable communities that are walkable that you dont have to get into a car to drive across the county to go to the doctors office or to the grocery store that you still know your neighbors and that you still have open spaces and that weve retained the beauty of whats here
5284896 the state gives us money for every 1 500 people to hire an additional law enforcement person
5284897 the same with fire and rescue if you have more and more houses way out in the outlying areas the smaller volunteer fire departments and rescue squads arent going to be able to serve that growing population in the way that they expect and deserve to be served
5284898 we are holding tightly to our tax rate but someplace down the road its going to have to go up
5284899 eventually there will be pressure to go from a sheriffs department to a police force
5284900 the population here hasnt grown as fiercely as one might think
5284901 the rest of that can be nestled easily within the staunton to waynesboro to lyndhurst stuarts draft area
5284902 i just see us being more tightly compacted in the fishersville area and the waynesboro suburbs if you will and stuarts draft but i think the overall rural character of augusta county wont change just those limited parts of it
5284903 i dont see a lot of changes in how we do fire
5284904 i can see us having a combination sheriffs department police department
5284905 im going to be pushing the regional eoc thing the budget problems are going to drive people who are not receptive to change it will drive people who have to look at things differently to think differently we can use this budget crunch that waynesboro has and staunton has to say come on guys you turned your eyes from us two years ago we need to get on with this thing and save the money
5284906 my vision that i see most of all for the area is the fact that were seeing an exodus from the major cities
5284907 the real question that comes up to us is can we provide in a competitive nature can we provide the quality of life that people are looking for
5284908 what i see as the major question is how do we compete against other places to provide that quality of life we have to recognize that the arts and theater and health care and schools are important we have to have kids around we need to hear the sound of playgrounds and we need to attract high tech jobs and you cant attract high tech jobs if you dont have kids
5284909 i see the corridor between staunton and waynesboro as being a vital economic engine
5284910 the county is truly in my opinion a suburban county already
5284911 too many times augusta county is looking at the obsession with the 58 cent tax rate and that translates to disparities with the cities because the cities are providing higher levels of services
5284912 a vibrant city one that is absolutely nurtured from the east end to the west end of town one that is comprehensive in nature in terms of development taking advantage of our river taking advantage of the blue ridge parkway and also making sure that were nurturing the commercial and industrial sector of our community i just see a well rounded community thats well supported has a healthy tax base and a bright future
5284913 we are struggling competitively to put the right deals on the table
5284914 certainly invista i think that they are reaching a point that theyre struggling to be competitive with china and with other countries weve got to understand like we did five 10 years that when we have all of our eggs in the basket of dupont years ago thats where the city went broke and basically relied on its tax base so the broadening of our tax base with our retail and commercial sector has certainly enabled us to have a little bit more confidence moving forward that we are expanding our tax base we have to be absolutely vigilant about trying to protect the base that we have but understanding that it is a completely different environment
5284915 in 2025 i dont think flooding is going to be on the radar screen for council in terms of things that we need to be doing hopefully by 2025 well be doing preventive maintenance only obviously moving forward we need to be moving on the stormwater which i have concerns about with the current program that we have but understanding the nature of what we need to do downtown around the south river there are certainly remedies that go along with our companion pieces to development and we can achieve those things its going to take strong political will its going to take this community getting behind conceptually ideas that we need to address and its going to take a lot of all these pieces coming together can we do it absolutely we can do it but it is going to be a communitywide undertaking where were going to have to rely on the very strong leadership of our city council and were going to have to rely heavily on public private partnerships but flooding can be addressed
5284916 david bottenfield said we needed to mark off this date the 16th of august for paint the valley blue that we were going to have a little
5284917 if virginia has 57 million barrels of oil available and it is not in the cue to be used and we use 20 million a day from some source then the 57 will extend what we have
5284918 so dad says hey you guys want to go down to covington and were thinking where the heck is covington
5284919 and then three hours later were driving down to covington
5284920 we went there we get a hat this guy sold him his hat off his head dad wanted a hat so the guy sells dad a hat
5284921 dads been doing this his whole life ive got to go to every acc basketball arena ive got to go to every major league baseball stadium im going to take older brother chris to every stadium in the northwest league
5284922 so when we heard it were like yeah were in
5284923 last night i got asked at least a half dozen times what are you trying to accomplish
5284924 i said the teams work really hard to promote themselves but nobody is promoting the league we need people to talk about what were talking about thats the one thing that im trying to do
5284925 this was supposed to be a night off these people were looking forward to a night off they worked eight hours maybe 10 and what are they going to do tonight theyre going to make sure that you and i have a good time
5284926 those are my heroes those are my all stars if i could have my own all star team when the kids go to covington all the volunteers would be there with them
5284927 if theyre making 40 000 youre saying hey thats part of the job but they went to church that morning that got up they go out there they run the grill they do whatever thats the story that im trying to tell
5284928 the biggest question weve been faced with the whole time is what will you consider a success i said everybodys going to judge this differently im going to judge this by how many people have a card and its half full because thats who im after
5284929 the people who are hard core fans theyre already going to all the parks theyre already doing this im just giving them a chance to be celebrated for it im going after the fan who might only go to one game or two games if i can get them to go to six then ive accomplished something
5284930 i cant ask people to drive to covington or haymarket with gas at 4 a gallon but that was never the intent anyway
5284931 i think jerry has undertaken a project that is going to be beneficial in the long run for our league and hes doing it at his own expense hes not getting a dime for it
5284932 some people said wheres the angle theres got to be an angle somewhere
5284933 i dont think there is an angle he just loves the game and he loves the valley league hes doing this to support the league as a whole
5284934 each team whether they have a winning record this year or not should be a winner because of around the valley in 60 days
5284935 the promotion has been wonderful to the league the exposure that its gotten through you through mike shickman at wsva this has been a real shot in the arm
5284936 i think its great for the league because it will reach people who maybe go to one or two places and now maybe some will go to more of them maybe all of them and theyll see how diversified the league is in terms of fields and communities and the way they play and everything
5284937 it will add some league fans where there are just team fans now there will be league fans and that will help us in promoting the league i think it will help all the teams in the league
5284938 its been three times the fun that i thought it would be we knew going in that it would be an adventure working the hours that we work its a little bit tougher but weve been everywhere
5284939 around the valley in a baseball daze promotion spreads love of summer league
5284940 david bottenfield said we needed to mark off this date the 16th of august for paint the valley blue that we were going to have a little
5284941 if virginia has 57 million barrels of oil available and it is not in the cue to be used and we use 20 million a day from some source then the 57 will extend what we have
5284942 you have to think that way thats where baseball is
5284943 ninety nine percent of what i hear back is very positive fans appreciate what im doing and parents like being able to go to one place and see how their son might be doing
5284944 david bottenfield said we needed to mark off this date the 16th of august for paint the valley blue that we were going to have a little
5284945 if virginia has 57 million barrels of oil available and it is not in the cue to be used and we use 20 million a day from some source then the 57 will extend what we have
5284946 when you clean up very polluted air as china is doing during these olympics it has a direct impact on global warming and temperatures rise
5284947 being from a fruit growing family apples and grapes are not that dissimilar you do the same things it was in my blood
5284948 the valley really hasnt established itself as a wine region yet but i think we will
5284949 we have a better climate im at 1 400 feet thats at least 500 feet higher than on the other side of the mountain it tends to make for cooler days cooler nights it tends to make the grapes better we have good limestone and shale soils to me we should be able to produce world class wines
5284950 hey its either that those 72 on the other side of the mountain are idiots or that they have something figured out and theres no sense for the mountains to serve as a barrier
5284951 when people come in for a tasting i want them to learn about the culture i want them to learn how we do what we do i want them to be able to experience everything there is to our wines
5284952 ninety nine percent of the people who approach me have an interest in wine and the interest in grape growing i would say is a natural horticultural extension of the interest in wine
5284953 though its probably something thats in the back of the mind of most people who take the first step with the vineyard
5284954 and once they start exploring the numbers the costs and the returns most people realize that for a small vineyard one can make more money selling wine than you can ever make selling grapes just due to the value added nature of wine
5284955 a lot of people get into it for the romance of it we got into because my wife was a teacher and i was in the navy had been in it 27 years and we spent a lot of time apart we got into it because we liked drinking wine and we wanted to do something where wed end up spending a lot of time together as opposed to apart
5284956 we got exactly what we wanted we spent a lot of time looking at the monetary aspect of it and how much time it would take to make money we never realized it would take three times the amount of time that we thought it would
5284957 i dont want to get much bigger than maybe 5 000 cases a year you can sacrifice quality for quantity and i dont want us to do that
5284958 i think our wines and i know im prejudiced now but our wines are superior to a lot of the warm weather wines that tend to be overalcoholic and oversweet and just not as interesting i think were making some good wines in the valley and some interesting wines
5284959 david bottenfield said we needed to mark off this date the 16th of august for paint the valley blue that we were going to have a little
5284960 if virginia has 57 million barrels of oil available and it is not in the cue to be used and we use 20 million a day from some source then the 57 will extend what we have
5284961 just a house full of stuff to pack up and move
5284962 the work of the ipr office at itma asia citme 2008 existing at exhibitions since march 2006 in accordance with chinese law has been followed by cematex our chinese trade fair partner bjitme has created good prerequisites here for implementing our trade fair conditions
5284963 more than every second company in textile machine construction first discovers that their own products have been illegally copied at exhibitions therefore it was the task of our office before the itma asia citme 2008 to inform our members fully concerning the legal situation to offer advice upon preparation and also to provide support on location to take action against product pirates
5284964 itma asia citme 2008 has shown that successful action to combat product pirates at trade fairs is also possible in china for companies who have prepared themselves for it well and who have protective rights in china
5284965 employees of the eu china ipr sme helpdesk were given an impression of how concerned our industry is and have held initial talks with employees of our member companies
5284966 in this way it can be hoped that the chinese have felt the negative effect themselves and are beginning to alter their way of thinking
5284967 think of the other as mortals plus were men and women just like anyone but theres something extra something that marks us as fey too it can be an innate talent like sensing or even controlling local weather patterns or a gift for premonition mayhap its as simple as the woman whose garden produces vegetables and flowers like mad when her neighbors can grow only weeds

5284981 some people said would it have been easier to lose by 40 000 votes i dont think so im proud of every daggone vote i got
5284982 its kind of like youre a kid on the playground and the bully picks on you and hits you in the stomach and you fall down youre hurting physically your feelings are hurt youre embarrassed because everybody on the playground including the pretty little girl saw you get hit and fall down your diaphragm stops working you cant breathe and you have two choices and one of them is not a choice one of them is to die to lie on the ground and pretend the world has gone away and of course it doesnt go away the other is to pick yourself up straighten yourself out and walk on and get stronger and get smarter
5284983 a lot of people worked very hard for me and asking people to work was one thing its tough for me asking people to work just to begin with i dont think people ought to waste time helping me out but i couldnt do it on my own so asking people to work and then putting in hours and trying for me and taking it to heart and letting them down that was the worst part
5284984 running for election put me in touch with so many places and so many wonderful people that it was a terrific experience for me i really enjoyed it
5284985 as much hard work as it was i enjoyed the experience of talking to people about any number of different subjects that sometimes i had never given any consideration to
5284986 it gave me a new appreciation of the valley we live in it also gave me an appreciation of some of the challenges that we face together
5284987 i sat down with former city councilman dick robinson and he asked me that very question he said are you ready to put yourself through that again and i told him sometimes you learn a heckuva lot more losing than you do winning there are folks out there who have never lost and having not lost they havent had that humbling experience that comes with that and that learning experience that comes with losing
5284988 i still have some embers in the ash of that campaign that i was able to blow on and rekindle into a fire but frankly the real seeds of this campaign were there before 2005 that was just a speed bump for me that 2005 campaign was just a speed bump
5284989 losing an election is not the end of the world its certainly not the worst thing thats ever happened in my life theres lots of people in this world who have to go through things a whole lot worse than that if losing an election is the worst thing that i have to go through in my life ill have been lucky and i can tell you right now its not the worst thing
5284990 david bottenfield said we needed to mark off this date the 16th of august for paint the valley blue that we were going to have a little
5284991 if virginia has 57 million barrels of oil available and it is not in the cue to be used and we use 20 million a day from some source then the 57 will extend what we have
5284992 heres the big problem even though producer prices take some time to work there way through to the consumer level and in the past have often never found their way there at all we see too much anecdotal evidence to the contrary this time around from kimberly clark nyse kmb to dow chemical nyse dow from united airlines nasdaq uaua to j m smucker nyse sjm companies far and wide are raising prices so expect future cpi price measurement to show inflation is out of bernankes control
5284993 we all came from somewhere and this is inescapable once you start interviewing your relatives who often still speak in an accented version of english
5284994 this is universally loved but because genealogy is a western sport we have a huge customer base of english irish and scottish folks and we have a very extensive client base of eastern european jews as well

5284996 the mailman was my favorite person because i would send off for a death certificate death certificates are my favorite documents because they have so much information
5284997 one thing that i advise also in my class is to contact the oldest person in their family and call them and start asking questions about genealogy and i dont mean just about dates i mean about stories because that is the most interesting part about genealogy
5284998 i was really just so interested in american you know the founders of america my ancestors who were there at the time of the founding of our country

5285025 i cant prove god exists that demons exist that angels exist theyre invisible you cant touch them feel them smell them but sometimes something so absolutely marvelous and wonderful happens beyond what you believe is mans ability to make things happen likewise there are things so awful so hideous so dumb that you just cant believe man is responsible for that activity so you look for evidence of satan

5285066 rechazo que se sindique al ppd como el partido que est incumpliendo los compromisos la verdad es que cuando uno hace un revisi n nacional hay una situaci n confusa producto del cierre de una negociaci n que fue compleja

5285068 yo estoy muy tranquilo porque kristel llega muy bien en lo f sico en lo t cnico y en lo sicol gico hizo una muy buena marca en 800 metros y eso posibilita que se sienta segura y confiada en su potencial
5285069 no nos ponemos metas en cuanto a un lugar espec fico pero ciertamente que hay un grupo de 10 u 11 competidoras que son muy parejas y entre las cuales la que lleve la mejor t ctica es la que tendr m s chances
5285070 kristel est en el grupo y puede salir primera o und cima como todas las dem s a m en verdad lo nico que me preocupar ser n los cinco minutos iniciales los primeros 400 metros porque es el momento clave para ponerse en la delantera y por lo tanto pueden haber muchos golpes u otras situaciones inesperadas que pueden restar concentraci n del objetivo central una vez pasado ese tramo inicial creo que las cosas se pueden dar muy bien para nosotros
5285071 kristel es la m s novatas de todas las dem s llevan 20 o 25 carreras de este tipo en el cuerpo y ella apenas seis por lo que claramente hay menos experiencia en cuanto a los aspectos t cticos pero s muy bien que ella llega en un gran momento de su preparaci n

5285138 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5285139 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5285140 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5285141 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5285142 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5285143 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5285144 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror

5285151 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5285152 in this vacuum they may see a period to step up activity in this time of uncertainty that is something that india needs to be alert to
5285153 musharraf was a comfortable point of reference who do you speak to now
5285154 who controls the nuclear button now that musharraf is gone
5285155 they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5285156 continued dedication to fight terrorism in all its forms remain deciding factors

5285161 and are working on their own jams when their schedules permit

5285185 cost segregation is a powerful and necessary part of accurately calculating depreciation for real property
5285186 a properly prepared study is invaluable to me as a cpa because it provides reliable support for preparing the depreciation schedule and reducing my clients taxes
5285187 clients expect us to seek out and utilize tools which will minimize their federal taxes
5285188 cost segregation is an appropriate conservative and cost effective tool to substantially reduce federal and state income taxes our clients have been extremely pleased with the results
5285189 we routinely obtain a cost segregation study after purchasing an investment property
5285190 dont you know that people will be angry at what you publish
5285191 get bitter and cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
5285192 the conservative message of t he p rimary s ource is obscured by its hateful tone and its racist homophobic anti semitic humor sections
5285193 you may be able to write hateful articles now protected by the university but youre leaving a paper trail thats going to catch up with you in the real world
5285194 if a counterpart publication by the tufts democrats i cant remember its even offer competition what makes anyone think another conservative publication could
5285195 the fact is that the primary source is the best edited best written and funniest publication on campus
5285196 moreover it is the conservative voice of tufts if other conservatives were truly unhappy with the way they were being represented they would have spoken up twenty five years ago
5285197 the accusation regarding content betrays the fact that most liberals arent interested in the articulate thoughtful and measured discussions of local and national politics that fill most of the sources pages
5285198 what theyre really interested in is getting riled up and getting indignant
5285199 who said the aim of the primary source was to create a campus of conservatives
5285200 who think that dialogue is productive the source realizes that the prejudices people bring with them to college are not likely to be overcome especially when they are being institutionally reinforced every day
5285201 so what is our purpose our purpose is to say what no one else is willing to say
5285202 that doesnt mean a lot of people arent thinking it of course there is a silent minority of conservatives on this campus
5285203 for this group of people which has chosen not to put itself on the line for the beliefs of the average american the primary source is a mouthpiece
5285204 we are a reminder that it is all right to laugh at diversity
5285205 and that in the words of aristophanes comedy is allied to justice most of all we are a reminder that a few individuals are all it takes to protect freedom of speech so lighten up
5285206 but slowly over the course of their undergraduate education peers and professors choke the openness out of them
5285207 wake up the primary source is far closer to the mindset of mainstream america than you think this explains several things it explains why former source staff members now enjoy prestigious careers in government industry and law all over the country
5285208 finally it explains why the vague threat of the paper trail is usually heard as a feeble last resort from the mouths of out of touch professors bewildered as their fascist attempts to silence the source fail once again
5285209 so until the military talk radio nine out of ten respectable think tanks and washington become liberal were not worried about getting jobs and the source isnt going anywhere
5285210 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me

5285365 es un esc ndalo y una verg enza que las tensiones internas del psoe las contradicciones y los fines absolutamente partidistas est n situ ndonos en un callej n sin salida poniendo a espa a en una tensi n sin precedentes

5285368 ponen a espa a en una situaci n sin precedentes
5285369 la falta de solidaridad y las contradicciones internas dentro del psoe nos lleven a una situaci n sin salida y de dif cil soluci n a la hora de establecer un sistema de financiaci n justo para todos los espa oles

5285376 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start

5285390 i really cant see whitney houston playing this little place
5285391 i dont see why she would come all the way out here
5285392 her career is kind of dead right now so maybe thats why shes coming here but still she could do better than this
5285393 but i dont think she needs the money that bad
5285394 if they pay her shell be here and so will i
5285395 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5285396 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5285397 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5285398 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5285399 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5285400 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5285401 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5285402 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5285403 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5285404 he was a senior administrator for a pedophile website and was effectively a librarian for the storing and distribution of indecent images of children
5285405 todays sentence reflects how seriously the criminal justice system views those who take gratification from the sexual abuse of children
5285406 its not a good thing or a bad thing its the evolution of retail
5285407 the future is on the internet and the customers know to go there too
5285408 the day of the single storefront of an antiques shop is done you change or die
5285409 i would like to stay open for a little longer thats why were consolidating were not ready to close up shop yet
5285410 the antique stores are kind of fun and funky but how many antiques can one family buy
5285411 if you put in an apparel store or a services business then the families that live in the neighborhood can frequent the shop more often
5285412 weve worked to develop this as a critical retail strip but its in danger
5285413 atlantic avenue has always evolved but now its evolving and spinning us right off the block
5285414 i think this furniture will be rediscovered in 20 years the way it did 40 years ago
5285415 were in a normal natural cycle victorian furniture has had 30 good solid years
5285416 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5285417 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5285418 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5285419 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5285420 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5285421 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5285422 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5285423 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5285424 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5285425 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5285426 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5285427 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5285428 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5285429 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5285430 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5285431 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5285432 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5285433 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5285434 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5285435 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5285436 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5285437 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5285438 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5285439 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5285440 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5285441 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5285442 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5285443 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

5285451 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5285452 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5285453 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

5285469 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5285470 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5285471 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5285472 this is a planning took where all things are going
5285473 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5285474 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5285475 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5285476 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5285477 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5285478 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5285479 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5285480 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5285481 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5285482 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5285483 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5285484 generate a place where workshops informal lectures interviews and other educational activities could take place
5285485 we cannot chase them away it is the policy of our government to help everyone but that makes it difficult also to cater for our own people
5285486 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5285487 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5285488 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5285489 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5285490 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5285491 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5285492 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5285493 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5285494 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5285495 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5285496 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5285497 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5285498 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5285499 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5285500 americans just want to be left alone our enemies are determined not to leave us alone but our media our intellectuals and the democratic party are trying to soothe us and assure us that we dont actually have to fight anybody we can win just by sitting still and being america
5285501 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5285502 were funded by venture capital theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken
5285503 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
5285504 i was very happy with the result even though i know we can play better football than we did worthing are one the favourites this season so to get a win against them is a good result
5285505 the players are playing together well considering the amount of new faces we kept our shape well and the work rate was good we can play a lot better which is pleasing in a way
5285506 i am glad that pugh scored the goal should give him a confidence boost and that could really help us
5285507 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5285508 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5285509 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5285510 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5285511 the supplier of last resort for dictators and human rights abusers
5285512 pervez musharraf has proven himself to be one of the biggest enemies of islam if the not the biggest
5285513 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5285514 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5285515 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me
5285516 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5285517 most expositors find an allusion to the standards of the roman legions in the expression the abomination of desolation and the explanation is highly probable the eagles were the objects of religious worship to the soldiers and the parallel passage in st luke is all but conclusive evidence that this is the true meaning we know from josephus that the attempt of a roman general vitellius in the reign of tiberius to march his troops through judea was resisted by the jewish authorities on the ground that the idolatrour images on their esigns would be a profanation of the law how much greater the profanation when those idolatrous emblems were displayed in full view of the temple and the holy city this was the last token which portended that the hour of doom for jerusalem had come its appearance was to be the signal to all in judea to escape beyond the mountains for then would ensure a period of misery and horror without a parallel in the annals of time
5285518 and arms shall stand on his part and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength
5285519 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week
5285520 being displayed in full view of the temple and holy city
5285521 plants the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain
5285522 unfortunately the business of trash collection and disposal is a very large ticket item and the city simply cannot shoulder the finances without this fee
5285523 but we are actively looking at alternatives with a concentration on finding a solution that is most cost effective for not only residents but also the city
5285524 its not who votes that counts its who counts the votes
5285525 moving the date of english local government elections to the date of the european parliament elections in 2009 consultation
5285526 gordon brown is set to postpone local elections next year in a bid to stave off a leadership challenge that could be triggered by a labour wipeout
5285527 gordon brown is clearly terrified of a bad beating in the county elections you can be sure that if he was confident of holding on to labour seats he would hold the local and euro elections on separate days this is all about protecting gordons back
5285528 we would have that again in england with first past the post for local elections and a list system for the euros
5285529 if we are to make an order moving the date of the local elections in 2009 such an order must be made by 7 november 2008 if following the consideration of the results of this consultation we were to change the date of the local elections we would lay an order moving the date of the elections before parliament not later than early october 2008
5285530 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5285531 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5285532 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5285533 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5285534 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5285535 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5285536 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5285537 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5285538 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5285539 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5285540 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5285541 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5285542 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5285543 sure as long as the machines are working and you can dial 911 but you take those things away you throw people in the dark you scare the shit out of them no more rules youll see how primitive they get
5285544 you scare people badly enough you can get them to do anything theyll turn to whoever promises a solution or whatever
5285545 going against the will of god walking on the moon or splitting his atoms or stem cells and abortions destroying the secrets of life that only god above has any right to
5285546 heaven and earth are cruel they treat all living things as straw dogs
5285547 obstetrics is peculiarly open to ideas for treatment which superficially seem slightly eccentric yet catch the imagination of pregnant women one example which has confused the obstetric scene for the last 15 years is abdominal decompression
5285548 for most obstetricians and their patients natures abhorrence of a vacuum seems likely to prevail
5285549 even if they dare to commit any crime during the olympics they wont be able to escape easily
5285550 give us 16 days of olympics and be rewarded with 5 000 years of our civilisation
5285551 it is all the foreign devils better to have a safe games than a farce like the torch relays in london paris and san francisco it was such a loss of face we dont want it here on our soil
5285552 lives lived in gaudy imitation of the less edifying aspects of the u s a
5285553 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
5285554 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
5285555 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5285556 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5285557 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5285558 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5285559 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5285560 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5285561 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5285562 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5285563 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5285564 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5285565 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5285566 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5285567 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
5285568 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go
5285569 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5285570 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5285571 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
5285572 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
5285573 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
5285574 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
5285575 cest une sentence injuste et inhumaine on va faire appel
5285576 distillers grains offer a high protein feed for livestock and help us meet all needs
5285577 critics lament how much corn goes into ethanol but often ignore the coproducts and calculate too high a figure

5285580 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5285581 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5285582 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5285583 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5285584 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5285585 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5285586 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5285595 s evident que si no hi ha una actitud clara de defensa dels interessos de catalunya nosaltres ens haurem de replantejar moltes coses
5285596 el maquillatge per emmascarar la resist ncia del govern espanyol a la gesti descentralitzada dels aeroports
5285597 deixi de marejar la perdiu en aquest tema i que aclareixi la seva proposta de cogesti que forma part del paquet de mesures econ miques anticrisi
5285598 inicialment la cogesti estava prevista pels aeroports amb un tr fic anual de 30 milions de passatgers per despr s la ministra de foment ha dit que estava elaborant uns estudis sense terminis per anar encaixant les aspiracions de tothom

5285603 it was a huge blow for us and it changed everything if it wasnt for the russians our lives would have been completely different
5285604 and in georgia its basically the same they are invading another country
5285605 the putin doctrine has been very much about rolling back the ukrainian and georgian revolutions and getting back to a position of malleable semi authoritarian governments that the russians are able to control
5285606 thats the aim in georgia regime change even if they stop their tanks miles from tbilisi they want saakashvili out
5285607 these russians they just fight fight and fight and they just dont listen to reason
5285608 maybe now the world knows better what russia is like
5285609 its incredible to think the united states would risk a direct military confrontation with russia for poland or another country in the region
5285610 thomas wishes celtic every success and likewise the club wishes thomas all the very best for the future
5285611 its been the same old story we show up fast but we cant put a whole race together so weve got to do some homework weve got to science it out and figure out what the heck is going on because we are sure fast when that race starts but ive been like that my whole career
5285612 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5285613 and if you are under great pressure before a big race it is difficult to get over your injuries quickly
5285614 i have experienced in the past the great pressure that government officials exert on the athletes as well as the coach and that they demand a gold medal otherwise it is meaningless
5285615 this will not be just another friendly for our team because the dutch will be eager to settle the score
5285616 i pick the best players and mark van bommel is one of them
5285617 he is strong can play good football has insight and above all can be merciless
5285618 all the russian players are in competition while mine are still warming up
5285619 this will be my squad and they will get my confidence
5285620 the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors
5285621 in times of universal deceit telling the truth will be a revolutionary act
5285622 in our country the lie has become not just a moral category but a pillar of the state
5285623 hp continues to distinguish the elitebook brand with sophisticated innovative designs that combine military standard durability with easy to use features and the right levels of performance
5285624 these great looking notebooks can withstand the rigors of the road meet the most demanding tasks and keep up with the ever changing mobile lifestyle
5285625 blustered that he would handle the human rights issue as an element for negotiations with north korea
5285626 we categorically dismiss this as a premeditated act of the u s to deliberately throw a hurdle in the process of the six party talks
5285627 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist

5285630 it is quite clear that the peace process has to be taken to a logical conclusion and it will be my priority to prepare a new constitution
5285631 there is one reason for all these examples of anarchy the absence of the state
5285632 we can only hope that all this will change with the election of a new prime minister
5285633 they swap food for drugs and then eat from the bins
5285634 it rots their brains punishment doesnt work because the addict is sick he cant help it
5285635 the ones that have got to go to prison are the peddlers the smugglers
5285636 whats the point of decriminalizing drug possession without stopping this social poison from entering the country
5285637 decriminalization is just another way for them to wash their hands of the problem
5285638 they used them as human shields the rebels killed them on their way out they were killed as if like chickens that is the report given to us by the civilians
5285639 i condemn the dastardly attack and the violence sowed by the milf early this morning in some towns of lanao del norte
5285640 we will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5285641 we have driven away the rebels we are going after them
5285642 these developments are a clear manifestation of the insincerity to the peace process of a significant portion of the milf
5285643 our leadership has not sanctioned these attacks this has to stop if we can confirm the involvement of our forces
5285644 eating of rats will serve twin purposes it will save grains from being eaten away by rats and will simultaneously increase our grain stock
5285645 we are very serious to implement this project since the food crisis is turning serious day by day
5285646 russia has finished the operation on halting georgias aggression against south ossetia
5285647 it is used during attacks against large scale sites and there was no point using it here
5285648 we agreed on further cooperation on the position of both sides from the troops pullout to humanitarian efforts
5285649 kejadian itu berlaku ketika hujan lebat dan dipercayai siew choo hilang kawalan ketika mengayuh di kawasan curam di situ sebelum terjatuh ke dalam longkang dan dihanyutkan arus deras ke sungai
5285650 tumpuan kawasan operasi mencari dan menyelamat ialah sepanjang longkang besar dan sungai itu
5285651 they have taken over the business centre the rural banks pawn shops
5285652 we appeal for sobriety and ask for ceasefire on both sides they should go back to the negotiating table and extend the people help we are willing to help
5285653 i think this is a wake up call to every one that this is one problem we really have to deal with we should aspire to move forward maybe this should be resolved in a round table discussion instead of letting the guns do the talking so to speak
5285654 maybe we should come up with some compromise because the old framework does not work anymore we should explore and be open to face the changes that might work
5285655 this looks to be like their reaction because iligan city is against bje and the milf is serious in its claims
5285656 god said in his heart i will never again curse the ground for mans sake
5285657 we feel the city should be ashamed of this secret prison theyve set up
5285658 the public was never going to view this place it was just found out
5285659 they got caught with this place they told our lawyers in negotiations that this place didnt even exist
5285660 our planned business class only service will be the most convenient way to travel between london and new york for those people based in or travelling to the heart of london
5285661 we managed to weigh it down and slide it right down into the pipe work
5285662 with a lot of coaxing and everything we managed to entice her with food and her toys to climb up the netting and we eventually managed to get her out of the pipe work
5285663 we were lucky the forecasted rain hadnt really come so there wasnt water pouring down the hillside and down the pipe work
5285664 vamos ver o que vai acontecer agora no pa s antes de comemorar
5285665 a an lise de musharraf em seu discurso exata o pa s enfrenta v rias crises e os l deres devem agora encontrar uma solu o para elas
5285666 a coaliz o nos dizia que musharraf era o principal obst culo vamos ver agora o que ela vai fazer
5285667 we looked around and then we see jim and his wife over at another table with washington quarterback jason campbell and his girlfriend and you can tell they re talking about football
5285668 this is a huge concern and it absolutely has to be addressed by the legislature
5285669 if somebody wants to know if my rep or senator is performing on the environment in the way i would like them to vote we should be able to say that
5285670 despite the widespread enthusiasm about the 2008 presidential elections connecticut residents are not optimistic about what it portends for an economic recovery
5285671 the economy is forcing many connecticut families to mortgage the future to get by in the present

5285900 clean powers technology has a very positive future i was convinced of this after my visit to the companys r amp d facility in newhaven uk where i saw the c 15 caterpiller engine in operation producing steam to power an auxiliary steam engine and storing the excess in an accumulator
5285901 i am proud to be joining such a forward looking environmentally conscious company clean power is at the forefront of developing and providing lower emission and more efficient power systems initially for transport refrigeration units and trucks and in the medium term for broader applications such as automobiles and ships as emission control takes higher priority on the global government agenda and in the public consciousness i look forward to promoting clean powers unique technology to the transportation industry helping it reduce fuel expense while benefiting the environment
5285902 we would like to thank all of our customers for supporting us for so many years
5285903 we love being in the neighborhood and serving what we believe to be simply the best coffee and we look forward to our next 30 years

5285905 the people of new orleans are resilient and community driven and its our commitment to each other thats allowing businesses to flourish once again in katrinas aftermath
5285906 pjs coffee has withstood competitive challenges and the impact of hurricane katrina and much like the city of new orleans pjs has remained and will remain a compelling brand and a special place for its consumers
5285907 from the coffee to the retail experience and to the belief that it will be the quintessential coffee destination in the southeast we are committed to keeping pjs true to its roots
5285908 both the jewelers for children and healing the divide organizations represent what the hope heart message is all about
5285909 we believe there is no better person to now lead first marblehead than our co founder dan meyers dan provides extraordinary strategic market and product leadership and is uniquely qualified to guide the company through this challenging operating environment
5285910 we would also like to thank jack for his services and contribution to the company jack led first marblehead in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 through a period of strong revenue and earnings growth and through a most challenging fiscal year 2008 as the company had to adjust its business model due to capital market disruption
5285911 i am determined to build on the strengths of first marblehead and take the steps necessary to best enable the company to enhance shareholder value first marblehead is committed to working with clients and helping students finance college education
5285912 gscps total investment of 192 5 million provides first marblehead with liquidity and financial flexibility in an environment where other institutions are stepping away from their willingness to help students achieve their aspirations
5285913 this gold concentrate shipment was produced from material extracted from the lower portions of our bulk sampling program in the l463 gold shoot the majority of which was recovered from the final stages of our underground bulk sampling program
5285914 most impressive are the bulk sample gold grades that were 5 7 to 6 3 grams per tonne produced during our trial stoping program which appear to be in line with the average gold grade we are seeing in our geologic modeling of the lower l463 gold shoot
5285915 we gained useful geological information from the underground bulk sampling program and are pleased that recoveries using conventional flotation have averaged around 90 we will use the revenue from the sale of these concentrates to offset some of our exploration costs going forward

5285964 do we then nullify the law by this faith not at all rather we uphold the law

5286001 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
5286002 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation

5286061 we had previously demonstrated that grp stimulates the growth of this particular cancer
5286062 this time we wanted to demonstrate the opposite effects by targeting grp receptors in neuroblastoma to see if we could make the cancer regress
5286063 in order for cells in a soft agar colony to proliferate and grow without adhering to a surface they have to possess malignant properties as in the original neuroblastoma cells
5286064 however our grp receptor silenced neuroblastoma cells behaved like nonmalignant cells their growth was significantly inhibited and they formed fewer new colonies
5286065 we wanted to see how these neuroblastoma cells would behave whether they would grow and or metastasize to the liver
5286066 the cancer cells that expressed the grp receptors behaved as we expected with rapid growth as well as aggressive liver metastases the implication is that the metastatic behavior of this cancer is driven by grp and its receptor
5286067 with the publication of our data we would like to propose an application involving a number of institutions to move forward with a phase 1 clinical trial using this fda approved grp receptor antagonist for neuroblastoma
5286068 we hope to demonstrate the safety of targeting grp receptors for effective inhibition of neuroblastoma growth and metastasis this is just such a tragic disease and with all the advances were making we ought to be able to make a dent in it
5286069 im really sick of hearing myself talk about my work

5286082 with the problems associated with contaminated heparin produced from pig tissues in china a non animal source of this essential drug is gaining importance
5286083 a safer version of the drug could result in less adverse effects and fewer deaths
5286084 if heparin is prepared the right way it should be consistent and safe even from an animal source
5286085 our biotech version of heparin will be prepared in a controlled environment ensuring that it is pure and free of contaminants

5286088 given all the new hair treatments out there theres a growing need to make hair feel more natural especially for women
5286089 for the first time we present an experimental setup that allows measuring the subtle forces both physical and chemical that arise when single hairs slide past each other or are pressed against each other
5286090 the findings will help provide clearer strategies for optimizing hair care products
5286091 the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair care products affect hair to hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion
5286092 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
5286093 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues
5286094 psychologists who work with clients with gender identity issues are not of one mind on this issue
5286095 accordingly if there were evidence showing the gid diagnosis to be similarly harmful and discriminatory against gender variant transgender or transsexual people there would be a precedent for a resolution discouraging psychologists from using this diagnosis
5286096 however there is a great deal of disagreement about the gid diagnosis and whether it is helpful or harmful therefore the task force does not recommend that apa take a position on gid at this time
5286097 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5286098 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5286099 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5286100 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them

5286103 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
5286104 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5286105 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
5286106 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5286107 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
5286108 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale

5286111 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5286112 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5286113 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5286114 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5286115 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
5286116 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games
5286117 this would reduce the percentage of students who engage in suicidal thinking who contemplate how to make an attempt and who continue to make attempts
5286118 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5286119 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5286120 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5286121 cops had the street closed off and tyra had bodyguards
5286122 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons some were whining that it was so bad for the environment
5286123 it was so disorganized people fell over the press outside and almost trampled two little girls tyra was acting like it was a live sporting event instead of the most self indulgent narcissistic crap
5286124 tyra kept saying when i was a model and would hardly let them talk

5286129 daniele eccelleva sugli altri prefetti e satrapi e il re pensava di stabilirlo sopra tutto il regno
5286130 tutti voi non mi date che parole stolte e vuote cercate solo di perdere tempo ma voglio la verit voglio la risposta ai miei desideri pi profondi
5286131 sia benedetto il nome di dio per sempre eternamente perch a lui appartengono la sapienza e la forza egli muta i tempi e le stagioni depone i re e li innalza d la sapienza ai savi e la conoscenza a quelli che hanno intendimento egli rivela le cose profonde e segrete conosce ci che nelle tenebre e la luce dimora con lui
5286132 dio parla ancora a qualcuno c qualcuno in grado di leggere i tempi e di capire cosa sta succedendo chi pu discernere i segreti del signore
5286133 quale argomento dobbiamo evitare nei nostri sermoni come possiamo farvi piacere affinch veniate nella nostra chiesa
5286134 allora il volto del re mut ed i suoi pensieri lo turbarono le giuntura dei suoi lombi si allentarono e le sue ginocchia iniziarono a tremare il re ordin a gran voce di far entrare gli astrologi e i magi
5286135 per favore pastore dicci cosa sta accadendo questo il giudizio cosa avverr perch non ci hai avvertito di quello che sarebbe successo ci dicevi che andava tutto bene ma abbiamo perso tutto
5286136 c un uomo nel tuo regno in cui lo spirito degli d i santi gi al tempo di tuo padre si trovava in lui una luce unintelligenza e una saggezza pari alla saggezza degli d i in lui fu trovato uno spirito straordinario conoscenza intelligenza e la facolt di interpretare i sogni di spiegare enigmi e di risolvere questioni difficili si chiami dunque daniele ed egli dar linterpretazione
5286137 tutti questi savi non mi hanno saputo dire niente non possono interpretare la scritta sul muro ma ho sentito dire che sai discernere i tempi per favore dimmi la verit e dissolvi i miei dubbi
5286138 tu belsatsar non ti sei umiliato ma ti sei innalzato con il signore del cielo dio ha contato i giorni del tuo regno e vi ha posto fine sei stato pesato sulla bilancia e sei stato trovato mancante
5286139 allora i capi e i satrapi cercarono di trovare unoccasione per accusare daniele circa lamministrazione del regno ma non potevano trovare alcuna occasione n alcun motivo di riprensione perch egli era fedele e non cera in lui alcuna mancanza da potergli rimproverare
5286140 noi non avremo nessun pretesto per accusare questo daniele se non lo troviamo in quello che concerne la legge del suo dio
5286141 ho troppo poco tempo per pregare il mio lavoro mi consuma ogni istante
5286142 non ho neanche un momento per pregare se vesto i bambini pulisco la casa e preparo il pranzo non mi rimane pi un momento libero
5286143 andate per le vie di gerusalemme guardate informatevi cercate per le sue piazze se vi trovate un uomo se ve n uno solo che pratichi la giustizia che cerchi la fedelt e io le perdoner
5286144 sar misericordioso se riuscir a trovare anche una sola persona che mi cerca
5286145 io ho cercato fra loro qualcuno che riparasse il muro e stesse sulla breccia davanti a me in favore del paese perch io non lo distruggessi ma non lho trovato
5286146 volsi perci la mia faccia verso dio il signore per dispormi alla preghiera e alle suppliche con digiuno con sacco e cenere feci la mia preghiera e la mia confessione al signore al mio dio
5286147 noi abbiamo peccato a noi la confusione di faccia perch abbiamo peccato contro di te abbiamo commesso iniquit abbiamo agito iniquamente
5286148 sentivo che mio marito si stava pian piano allontanando da me e non riuscivo a capire come mai poi un giorno entrai nel suo studio e vidi che stava guardando dei siti porno su internet
5286149 questo disastro ci piombato addosso tuttavia non abbiamo implorato il favore del signore del nostro dio non ci siamo ritirati dalla nostra iniquit e non siamo stati attenti alla sua verit il signore ha vigilato su questa calamit e ce lha fatta venire addosso perch il signore il nostro dio giusto in tutto quello che ha fatto ma noi non abbiamo ubbidito alla sua voce
5286150 abbiamo visto tutto il degrado morale nel nostro paese ed abbiamo visto i nostri pastori curare soltanto i propri interessi tutta la nostra societ va verso la distruzione non ci siamo votati alla preghiera se solo avessimo pregato dio ci avrebbe allontanati dai nostri peccati ma lui ha aspettato che noi ci muovessimo rinnovandoci le promesse di restaurazione nei nostri confronti ma non gli abbiamo dato ascolto anzi ci siamo lentamente allontanati da lui divenendo sazi con i peccati di questa societ malvagia per questo ci venuto addosso il giudizio
5286151 signore non voglio partecipare a quello che sta accadendo fammi essere un esempio della tua potenza preservatrice in questepoca corrotta non mi importa se tutti gli altri non pregano io continuer a pregare
5286152 mentre stavo ancora parlando in preghiera quelluomo gabriele che avevo visto prima nella visione mandato con rapido volo si avvicin a me allora dellofferta della sera
5286153 daniele io sono venuto perch tu possa comprendere quando hai cominciato a pregare c stata una risposta e io sono venuto a comunicartela perch tu sei molto amato fa dunque attenzione al messaggio e comprendi la visione
5286154 o signore mostrami dove mi sono allontanato dove ho mancato e poi aiutami ad affrontare questa situazione qualsiasi cosa dovr affrontare dio fa che rimanga in ginocchio desidero vederti ristorare la tua chiesa
5286155 le tentazioni ci sono ancora ma ora corriamo sempre nella cappella a pregare nessun commento

5286158 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5286159 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5286160 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5286161 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown
5286162 these are the bacteria that maintain the earths health some of the methane escapes in some parts of the lake you can see the bubbles but whatever doesnt escape as bubbles these bacteria do a very good job of eating it
5286163 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5286164 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5286165 its time for big corporations to pay their fair share

5286167 neutralizing antibodies derived from the b cells of 1918 influenza pandemic survivors
5286168 ninety years after survivors encountered the 1918 pandemic influenza virus we collected antibody producing b cells from them and successfully isolated b cells that produce antibodies that block the viral infection
5286169 the antibodies produced by these cells demonstrated remarkable power to block 1918 flu virus infection in mice proving that even nine decades after infection with this virus survivors retain protection from it
5286170 the fact that you can isolate these anti 1918 memory b cells so long after infection will hopefully provide the impetus to further study the mechanisms behind long lived immunity
5286171 our findings show that survivors of the pandemic have highly effective virus neutralizing antibodies to this powerful virus and humans can sustain circulating b memory cells to viruses for up to 9 decades after exposure
5286172 these findings could serve as potential therapy for another 1918 like virus
5286173 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led
5286174 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5286175 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5286176 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms
5286177 the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5286178 just like a mass on a spring the pulse produces an oscillation of the spins of singlets and triplets in the organic led
5286179 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5286180 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5286181 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5286182 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5286183 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5286184 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5286185 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5286186 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5286187 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
5286188 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
5286189 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5286190 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
5286191 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture

5286194 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5286195 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5286196 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder

5286200 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5286201 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5286202 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5286203 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5286204 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5286205 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5286206 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5286207 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5286208 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5286209 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5286210 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5286211 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5286212 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5286213 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5286214 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5286215 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5286216 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
5286217 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5286218 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to you know not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
5286219 all of a sudden the door of the cell opened the guard came in he loosened the ropes
5286220 and i was standing outside for my few minutes outside my cell
5286221 he came walking up he stood there for a minute and with his handle on the dirt in the courtyard he drew a cross and he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away for a minute there there was just two christians worshipping together
5286222 my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or a different view
5286223 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5286224 when i find myself taking the wrong step i think a lot of times its because im trying to protect myself instead of do gods work
5286225 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage

5286563 blood and death is part of war and is also part of telling the story of war we do not add gratuitous violence to our games but we do want the true to life nature of combat to be revealed without this the sacrifice that the real soldiers of hells highway endured would be meaningless and the telling of a dramatic historical event would be trivialized
5286564 for the fans of fenerbahce i am sad to announce that after giving my all to this club i personally love the management have made it impossible for me stay
5286565 two seasons ago even when i was injured i agreed to play for fenerbahce just to make sure we won the title and i am happy that i did because of my commitment to the club
5286566 since then there has been some dishonest briefings to the turkish media about the complications from the surgery
5286567 since they have stopped paying my salary i am now a free agent and i expect that status to be confirmed by fifa later this month
5286568 celtic football club thomas gravesen and thomass representatives have agreed that he will part company with the club
5286569 im only going to bring quality in we havent got the money to go out and buy six 15million players
5286570 we dont have that so of course we are going to bring players in who are down at the lower end of the market
5286571 but as ive always said im looking to get the main players in first then we will look at what we can do after that
5286572 we feel very strongly that my constituents deserve the maximum service they can possibly get and the facilities are here to do it
5286573 weve not had a crisis like this since probably the great depression and our area has been hit more dramatically
5286574 people tend to panic in times of crisis and they dont want to talk to their lenders this workshop is a way of getting them to talk to people that can help to lay a foundation of knowledge and understanding the best we can
5286575 this is not armageddon this is not the destruction of the housing market as we know it
5286576 there are angry people and i understand that they deserve to be angry but at the same time our message is to stay with it stay with your property
5286577 i think it shows just how big a need there is for something like this
5286578 we have well over 600 people here and people are still coming in the doors
5286579 we knew wed get a response but we had not idea how a big a response the hud people the real estate and lenders people my gosh they really responded all of them have a piece in the game everyone is facing difficulties so this is kind of a spirit that says this is a community and were in it together
5286580 this is a big step and theres a lot of good information being talked about but you have to wonder why now is it because theyre losing their profits
5286581 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
5286582 even the strongest person becomes mush when the topic turns to raises
5286583 just remember that your boss will also be uncomfortable talking about it with you
5286584 you could be the organizations powerpoint guru or possess some skill that everyone comes to you for help with
5286585 what you are effectively doing is running a marketing campaign for yourself you want to make sure youve got visibility with people other than your boss
5286586 a script will help you feel comfortable that you can objectively prove your worth to the organization
5286587 if a companys policy is to give annual raises its hard to get an exception to the rule
5286588 usually decisions come from senior management and your boss wont have any latitude to go outside the companys policy
5286589 the average person usually cant step aside from his or her emotions
5286590 also your manager may go on the defensive if you ask for a larger raise during your review
5286591 if your manager asks you what raise you have in mind you dont want to gasp and go blank
5286592 if you were offered a 3 percent raise you cant ask for 7 percent it just wont happen
5286593 if you got a 3 percent raise but want a 5 percent raise say ive accomplished xyz i possess xyz skills i put in extra time at the office and im a bit disappointed with the raise
5286594 be sure to use an i message rather than a you message it sounds less accusatory
5286595 it also may put you on top of the layoff list
5286596 talking about what someone else received really tends to turn a boss off
5286597 there was such a rumor that boris s wort was going to show up
5286598 the only thing they could count on every day was that show
5286599 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5286605 its frustrating for those who would like to take action to help those in extreme poverty in our own countries and in third world countries where billions are in extreme poverty starving or dying of preventable illnesses what is needed is for us to take action but individually its so hard to make a difference when the problem is so overwhelming in large numbers we can not only help we can greatly reduce the problem the first world for example has the power to wipe out so much of this suffering with action by the elected officials of our countries thats the power of this global conversation by getting people talking we are creating the impetus for change
5286606 i want to be at that birds nest with our team it would be great to celebrate the gold medal in such a beautiful place but im not concentrating on it now we have to beat belgium to be able to visit the birds nest
5286607 these are not super eagles this is a different team and we want to see it so
5286608 why make it so tiny why dont you make something she can actually use for several years make it twin size
5286609 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
5286610 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
5286611 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
5286612 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
5286613 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
5286614 it was though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
5286615 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england

5286621 i dont care who it is after 33 years of something you need a change
5286622 and i needed a change ive welcomed it my enthusiasm is there my energy is there and working with patti and trip is going to be terrific
5286623 it wouldnt be reality tv as we know it but itd be awful close
5286624 its not a time buy its something were trying to sell to the networks like youd sell
5286625 so we can look at it now and say there are x number of veterans who are coming back on a regular basis from afghanistan we can look at the figures and say well there arent that many at the moment that are presenting with problems
5286626 but what we can say with some confidence is that over the coming five to 10 years a lot more of those people will have problems
5286627 those three people are with this soldier from start to finish to ensure that the soldier can get through the system without having to fight
5286628 there was nothing wrong with taks its just that mabuza was more cunning and managed to neutralize his style of boxing from the onset he came with a defined game plan and it somehow worked for him
5286629 there are plenty of other upcoming boxers who are waiting in the wings to get a bite at either the continental title or world crown so i still strongly believe we are on the right path and it wont be long before we produce another world champion after the legendary harry simon we have world class boxers around here and these boys are itching to stand up and be counted should the opportunity arise
5286630 under normal circumstances we would not have fancied a rematch against naule at this stage but we knew he has not fought anybody since we took the title away from him earlier this year and that gave us an indication that he must be a bit rusty so we were very confident coming into this bout

5286697 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5286698 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5286699 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5286704 weird nothing from ibm other than the announcement letters posted to ibm com world wide not even a press release no customer stories
5286705 maybe this whole xiv thing wasnt really all that big a deal after all
5286706 theyve taken a very conservative step in presenting this product to the market
5286707 on the contrary i think its because ibm is ibm and they like to do things in a conservative fashion

5286716 willkommen in der wirklichkeit herr professor das bem hte sch nreden der prek ren situation in den wiener gemeindebauten kennen wir von den sozialisten seit jahrzehnten richtiger werden ihre argumente aber trotzdem nicht noch immer wird gerade von den rathaus sozialisten eigentum gegen ber mietwohnungen stark benachteiligt von konflikten in sachen l rm schmutz ber die u erst schlampige arbeit der hausbetreuung bis zur intransparenten vergabe von gemeindewohnungen das s ndenregister ist lange
5286717 die grundrechnungsarten sollte auch professor kopietz beherrschen das hei t n mlich nach adam riese dass ein drittel keinesfalls mehr in den gleichen gemeindebau ziehen w rde alleine diese zahl zeigt dass der ideologisch besetzte soziale wohnbau in wien gescheitert ist

5286728 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5286729 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5286730 he tips them off he loves the attention jen didnt want to believe it was happening but it was and she has no tolerance for that
5286731 cobwebs come flying out of mayers wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jen would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her

5286734 the list will get more than 25 million page views on our web site millions more will see it on national tv and through local coverage and thats not including you and 7 8 million others reading about it in the magazine
5286735 being considered one of the best places to live in america by such a credible source not only reinforces what we residents already know it also exposes the many benefits of our community to the world
5286736 apparently our experience over the years in midlothian made an impact on my children when my daughter relocated with her husband they chose a home in the midlothian area primarily for the cost of housing quality of schools and because of her experience as a child growing up in the area
5286737 i like the pool the playground the tennis courts and i have all different kinds of friends
5286738 midlothian offers the best real estate because you not only get great houses in the right price range but you get some land too i also see great diversity in midlothian blacks whites asians indians and its important because things are not just local anymore theyre global
5286739 im very pleased that the only area in the entire richmond region named to the money magazine list was here in chesterfield county midlothian is a great place when you look at the combination of history preservation and growth making it a terrific story of economic development
5286740 its on our web site we refer to it when were talking with prospects or sending out information we use national rankings such as this to promote the county
5286741 in combination with the other virginia localities named on the list it keeps virginia front and center with those seeking to relocate from a retirement standpoint or with those choosing to relocate a business
5286742 the varsity baseball field at midlothian high school where we spent a lot of time with our children and developed special memories
5286743 mid lothian mines park its right behind my house and its a beautiful walk in the woods chesterfield county did a fabulous job preserving its history and creating a beautiful place for us all
5286744 i can tell because that is my old dodge durango
5286745 people have mentioned the photo to me and so i know its being seen
5286746 we have regular loyal customers but we also have a lot of tourists and out of towners come through because quilters will come off the beaten path to visit a good quilt shop
5286747 in saluting midlothian you have to give the people who developed sycamore square 30 years ago credit its a great place to work and shop thanks to what sycamore square started and the vmvc has focused on were getting more and more fun shops and restaurants in the village
5286748 midlothian has always had a defining image that goes beyond just being another bedroom community to richmond it seems when you have that defining image then community pride will stay strong which results in citizens re investing in the community with volunteer time festivals school support athletic leagues etc this community pride and citizen participation is what makes midlothian a great place to live
5286749 the negotiations will continue under the facilitation of south african president thabo mbeki
5286750 it is our expectation as zanu pf that a deal will be concluded in the fullness of time so that we can put behind us the divisions conflict the polarisation that in fact has divided our country

5286754 it overturned as it was crossing a bridge on the river glace
5286755 in my travels round the world i have always been surprised that no matter where i go people recognize and know me from europe australia and india to the philippines and the zulu nation in south africa this got me thinking i realized that while two people from two entirely different countries and backgrounds may seem to have nothing in common the only thing they might have in common is me so i decided to start a network where people from across the world might come together and get a conversation started over me where it will lead i dont know but the world would be a better place if everyone talked a little more to each other
5286756 the momentum behind the move came from the financials index
5286757 wider even than at the time of the bear stearns bailout
5286758 increased new issuance is expected in the upcoming months reducing demand for bonds in the secondary market
5286759 there could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely
5286760 the market will probably get through this hurricane news pretty quickly
5286761 the number one story in global assets is for now the rise of the dollar index
5286762 since it was a key market input for the upward move of crude oil any further rise in the dollar index should further limit the upside potential for oil
5286763 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5286764 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5286765 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5286766 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves
5286767 an afghan woman and two children died in the sangin area when uk forces fired rockets at taliban fighters unaware that civilians were in the vicinity of enemy fighters in a local compound
5286768 never run a 100 yard dash in a 90 yard room
5286769 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5286770 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5286771 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5286772 i would really like to see him do things in tennessee that would help in other working class and blue collar places like ohio
5286773 job security and health care are huge here he needs to come to the aisle of home depot and show them that a harvard graduate which i am as well knows how to help them

5286778 door inzicht in return on investment te bieden wordt het makkelijker voor bedrijven om strategische beslissingen te nemen op dit gebied

5286782 we were basically stuck up the canyon without our rafts
5286783 we had no supplies no food and very little water we lost everything
5286784 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5286785 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5286786 we see substantial differentiation in the performance of small balance pools compared to that of traditional cmbs pools

5286792 in der heutigen kabeg aufsichtsratssitzung haben sp und vp ihr wahres gesicht gezeigt ein v llig wild gewordener und ebenso ahnungsloser stephan tauschitz glaubt mit hilfe der sp die kabeg nach seinen w nschen umkrempeln zu k nnen indem er nicht nur den aufdecker mandl zum t ter stempeln will sondern nun auch noch den aufsichtsratsvorsitzenden strutz f r befangen erkl rt
5286793 sp und vp wollen einfach die kabeg verpolitisieren f r diese rot schwarze umf rbeaktion ist ihnen jedes mittel recht der versuch strutz befangenheit vorzuwerfen weil dieser sich vor einem halben jahr f r einen job in der kabeg beworben diese bewerbung dann aber zur ck gezogen hat ist v llig absurd und kann nur in die kategorie geistige schreberg rtnerei eingeordnet werden untersuchenswerter w re da schon der umstand dass der sohn von sp landesr tin cernic welche sich immer als besondere gegnerin von prof mandl positioniert hat auch in der kabeg besch ftigt ist das ist meiner meinung nach im gegensatz zu strutz zur ckgezogener bewerbung wirklich ein fall von befangenheit
5286794 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5286795 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5286796 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5286797 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5286798 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5286799 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5286800 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5286801 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5286802 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5286803 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5286804 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5286805 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5286806 simply having a bunch of things is not the key to happiness our data show that you also need to appreciate those things you have its also important to keep your desire for things you dont own in check
5286807 ellas not that interested in movies shed far rather be playing with her dolls and barbies but thats good i think thats healthy
5286808 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
5286809 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5286810 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5286811 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5286812 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5286813 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5286814 they were huge tied together with a gold ribbon and i thought come on a man who sends something like that has to be worth working with
5286815 its not the typical mother daughter thing but were extremely close
5286816 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5286817 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5286818 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5286819 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5286820 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5286821 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5286822 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5286823 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5286824 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5286825 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5286826 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5286827 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5286828 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5286829 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

5286854 when we started spore we were thinking about how wed make an engine that had the possibility of expansion so yes well add to the experience
5286855 i think however we have a very cool opportunity to take spore in a few different directions too the editors are so cool and fun that we want to advance those as well as the gameplay that we put into the core game
5286856 we are not shipping with the flora editor sorry its something we eventually want to get out there as it is fun to work with

5286860 i am never afraid because i have seen so much eruptions in 23 years that even if i die tomorrow i dont care
5286861 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5286862 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5286863 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5286864 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5286865 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5286866 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5286867 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5286868 who are open to doing something on the production side
5286869 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5286870 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5286871 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5286872 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5286873 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5286874 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5286875 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5286876 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

5286905 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5286906 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5286907 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5286908 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5286909 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5286910 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5286911 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5286912 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5286913 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5286914 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5286915 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5286916 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5286917 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5286918 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5286919 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5286920 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5286921 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5286922 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5286923 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5286924 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5286925 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5286926 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission

5286928 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5286929 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5286930 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5286931 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5286932 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5286933 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5286934 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5286939 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5286940 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5286941 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5286942 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

5287003 you would think theyd use the present indicative laid infers a completed action wherein even the dimmest porn aficionado turns to a porn magazine looking for the possibility of finding a lay is out of the question after all it is only a tawdry magazine then said reader will surely seek out the next best thing in the form of pleasuring him or herself all things being equal thus the logical congruence of the adjectival lay and all its future potential subjunctive form implies as in read this magazine dear reader laid infers that the contents in question have already gone down the garden path so why would i or any other potential reader want to fork out for a magazine in which someone elses bolt has already been shot it just doesnt make sense

5287080 tackle what members of both parties see as his greatest vulnerability with undecided voters his otherness
5287081 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
5287082 the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
5287083 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5287084 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5287085 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5287086 verbosity and love of his own voice that drive many including by some accounts mr obama nuts
5287087 the party is putting more money into what strategists call early voter persuasion getting a jump on previous years in their push to identify democratic voters and nail down their allegiance by providing background information and other material it is distinct from voter turnout drives that will begin closer to the election

5287093 no one should be allowed to take thousands of american innocent american lives of course evil must be defeated we are facing the transcendent challenge of the 21st century radical islamic extremists
5287094 i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely and one of the things that i strongly believe is that you know we are not going to as individuals erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront it when we see it
5287095 a whole glossary of often colorful expressions that could be described as sub subprime they reflect the deceit cynicism and scandalous exploitation that are taking the homes of many thousands perhaps millions of families

5287097 tumultuousness if coupled with discipline and a cool mind is not such a bad sort of thing in other words unless one wants to live a stunningly boring life one ought to be on good terms with ones darker side and ones darker energies
5287098 they were like you know once you make the final table you make a three month break and then you know i almost lost money on it because i didnt believe them i was like ill bet you money that you dont and then when their arm was out ready to shake my hand i knew they were serious
5287099 the pace of play at that final table is going to be ridiculously slow
5287100 is the minimum stack size required for unhampered post flop play including information bets and more advanced moves on later streets or against more aggressive deep stacked opponents
5287101 yeah but the blinds are very small in relation to the stack sizes here
5287102 theres not a single player at the table whos ready to just push under the gun or raise all in it would surprise me greatly unless there are just some huge hands like aces versus kings or something like that to see any elimination here in the first three or four hours of this tournament
5287103 ive been riding since the age of 16 but only got my full licence about three years ago
5287104 i love the new bmws and was really intrigued by them especially the technical brilliance wizardry and german engineering im really excited about this bike and am looking forwards to getting out of town on it ive got a couple of friends and were intent on touring the north of italy and riding across the alps into switzerland wed also like to ride around the british isles which would be a great way to discover my own back yard
5287105 i actually spoke to ewan about a good motorcycle insurance provider because hed know of course i think its amazing what these guys did though and it was great that they documented it all to share with us what i love is the idea of a motorcycle being like a horse of the modern age theres something much more intriguing and magnanimous about these guys clad in all their gear on these big german bikes than there would be travelling by car a car is more bondaged and encased whereas on a bike youre out there and youre more accessible it feels more immediate and its a great way to cross boundaries and see other cultures and have them see you because they know youve come a long way on a giant bmw into say mongolia i mean what a thrill for both parties to see
5287106 its good to put a helmet on and disappear for me the bike is about making the hours work in the day i couldnt bear to drive in london and the buses are very slow so just being able to jump on the bike and get to meetings in soho and then quickly get back out to notting hill is great of course theres no congestion charge for bikes either so thats good i think there should be a greater initiative to get more people riding and all bus lanes should be open to motorcycles that would really help things flow with this bmw though im looking forwards to getting out of town and into the country to try a bit more of the open road
5287107 although acting will always be there as its my absolute drive and passion im moving more into producing and directing and am getting really interested in the making of aspects behind the camera im just enjoying life at the moment the bike is a good metaphor for that of course because it gives the freedom to get out and enjoy whats around you you can have great plans but in executing those plans you can miss a trick in actually getting to that destination sometimes sitting back and watching the countryside go by is just as important as reaching the final place
5287108 were geared up for that were capable of working within that environment so the guys that go into the scene are in hazardous materials suits they have to go through hazmat decontamination going in and going out it just makes the process a little longer thats all
5287109 after that theres testing to be done with the evidence that theyve seized well be working in concert with the centre for forensic science theyve been kind enough to be at the scene
5287110 they dont often have them right at the scene but that testing all these things it could take months before we know
5287111 one thing that really makes me upset myself is that i felt i didnt do enough before
5287112 i knew people were upset about it i know people who wrote and complained and i didnt do enough
5287113 our friend danny went to have his tank filled and they overfilled it put 45 in a 20 psi tank
5287114 there is a technique used for draining cylinders for re certifying them
5287115 we use a system to pump the propane out of the tank its safer no spark no flame
5287116 my first opinion was theres foul play because the actual chances of a propane explosion like that are so slim propane is harder to ignite than gasoline
5287117 propane tanks are not something you just throw a match at and it lights it has to be at a certain pressure certain atmospheric conditions
5287118 somebody did something they shouldnt be doing especially at four oclock in the morning

5287147 drifter is a miracle of courage he underwent total amputation of his left front leg and shoulder in 2002 to remove a peripheral nerve sheath tumor a rare aggressive form of cancer surgery saved his life and he cheerfully adapted to life as a three legged dog
5287148 in the summer of 2006 drifter became paralyzed and could no longer get up or move around
5287149 drifter could barely move at first but after a few days of physical therapy he began to crawl around

5287154 when she was spayed the vet was surprised by the size of her cleft palate she said that most dogs with such a large cleft palate dont survive but faith had the will to live shes over 4 years old and still has a passion for sucking on teddy bears we call them her sucky bears

5287170 als anfang m rz in hamburg beinahe eine lufthansa maschine abgest rzt w re enth llte bild das traurige geheimnis der sch nen pilotin auf ihrer titelseite ein blick ins studivz reichte um herauszufinden was die hobbys und vorlieben was die ngste von maxi j 24 waren
5287171 das st bern nach privatdaten im studivz geh rt mittlerweile offenbar zum handwerkszeug jedes bild redakteurs
5287172 nat rlich nutzen bild redakteure wie im brigen alle anderen journalisten auch alle verf gbaren informationen im internet f r die recherche inwieweit diese informationen bestandteil eines artikels werden h ngt nat rlich ganz vom einzelfall ab
5287173 meine praktikantin wies mich darauf hin dass caroline bei studivz registriert ist
5287174 ich konnte den kontakt zu drei freundinnen von caroline herstellen mit denen ich per e mail und telefonisch korrespondierte
5287175 die letztlich alle das ziel haben die weltherrschaft an mich zu rei en
5287176 ich habe die redaktionen auf die herkunft des bildes hinge wiesen und gebe den schwarzen peter damit weiter
5287177 zu redaktionsinternen vorg ngen u ern wir uns grunds tzlich nicht zum anderen sind wir dem quellenschutz verpflichtet
5287178 gro e skepsis die uns presseleuten nach kurzer zeit aus carolines freundeskreis entgegengebracht wurde
5287179 wer kann mir etwas ber caroline erz hlen sehr dringend
5287180 ich war damals 59 jahre alt da konnte ich mich doch nicht mehr mit richtigem namen in einem studentennetz anmelden
5287181 sie sah sich selbst als k nig der unterwelt wollte diabolische pl ne schmieden und die weltherrschaft an sich rei en das zumindest schrieb die 21 j hrige studentin caroline b aus passau auf ihrer internetseite ob sie sich in eine fantasiewelt fl chtete weil sie ahnte dass ihr wirkliches leben nur kurz sein w rde
5287182 nachdem wir keine anderen informationen ber sie finden konnten mussten wir uns eben auf das verlassen was sie ber sich schreibt au erdem arbeitete ich unter immensem zeitdruck
5287183 das war die eine seite von caroline b die andere driftete ins mystische sie h rte gothic musik und las irvine walsh der auch das drehbuch f r den abgedrehten kultfilm trainspotting geschrieben hat der zur ihren lieblingsstreifen z hlte
5287184 mit dieser art der informationsbeschaffung die grenzen der geschmacklosigkeit berschritten
5287185 den beleidigenden ton ihrer zuschrift f hren wir darauf zur ck dass der gewaltsame tod einer kommilitonin sie offensichtlich nicht kalt gelassen hat ein gutes zeichen
5287186 jedes mittel nutzen um an m glichst authentische aussagen zu gelangen
5287187 die pnp hatte bei studenten schon immer ein schlechtes image
5287188 ein v llig falsches bild wurde von caroline in den berichten gezeichnet sie wurde regelrecht in den dreck gezogen
5287189 dass dieser branche absolut das mitgef hl die soziale verpflichtung verloren gegangen ist hat mich so erschreckt dass ich angewidert bin mir ist der spa am studium vergangen da man ja irgendwann f r solche gef hllosen menschen arbeiten muss
5287190 die verwendung von mitgliederfotos und informationen aus studivz und sch lervz zum zwecke der berichterstattung verletzt die urheber und pers nlichkeitsrechte unsere nutzer solange die rechte nicht an die entsprechenden medien abgetreten wurden eine derartige verwendung verbieten wir ausdr cklich in unseren allgemeinen gesch ftsbedingungen zudem empfinden wir diese art von missbrauch als respekt und geschmacklos gegen ber unseren mitgliedern der nutzer kann gegen das entsprechende medium rechtlich vorgehen was bei einem missbrauchsfall auch in unserem interesse ist
5287191 ihre gef hle ihre erlebnisse ihre freunde ihr leben gedankenlos firmen an die umfassende datens tze ber sie besitzen besser als alles was die gestapo und stasi je hatten
5287192 das internet bietet unter anderem in den gro en sozialen netzwerken viele recherchem glichkeiten f r journalisten hierbei muss jedoch immer bedacht werden dass die informationen die ein nutzer in ein solches forum einstellt dort erst einmal nur f r einen bestimmten personenkreis ver ffentlicht werden in der regel bedenkt kaum jemand dass auch journalisten das forum als quelle nutzen k nnten von daher sind von seiten der journalisten unbedingt die pers nlichkeitsrechte der nutzer zu wahren ziffer 8 des pressekodex nur weil sich jemand in einem solchen portal vorstellt hei t dies nicht dass die daten auch f r die ver ffentlichung in der presse freigegeben sind dies gilt insbesondere auch f r fotos beispielsweise von opfern oder t tern auch das thema datenschutz sollten die journalisten dabei im auge haben ein jugendlicher nutzer des internets ist diesbez glich h ufig sehr unbedarft daher obliegt dem journalisten hier auch eine spezielle sorgfaltspflicht
5287193 dass journalisten angaben ber personen in den sogenannten sozialen netzwerken f r ihre recherchen verwenden ist nicht nur legitim sondern notwendig um ein m glichst umfassendes bild einer person zu gewinnen allerdings d rfen sie sich nicht ausschlie lich der sozialen netzwerke bedienen im klartext studivz kann erste hinweise geben und m gliche kontaktpersonen nennen der direkte kontakt zwischen dem journalisten und den kontaktpersonen muss dennoch erfolgen und selbstverst ndlich m ssen journalisten die im pressekodex festgelegten medienethischen regeln beachten dazu geh rt beispielsweise dass sie nicht ohne einwilligung der angeh rigen das foto der ermordeten ver ffentlichen d rfen selbst wenn es simpel ist ber studivz an das foto zu gelangen
5287194 auch lange bevor es das internet gab stellten sich journalisten die frage wie sie mit informationen aus der privatsph re eines menschen umgehen ob sie intime details um der sensation und des kommerziellen erfolgs willen ver ffentlichen und um der eigenen eitelkeit zu schmeicheln und dabei einen rufmord in kauf nehmen oder ob sie solche informationen zur ckhalten um das ansehen eines menschen sein leben gar nicht zu zerst ren
5287195 die w rde des menschen sollte respektiert werden das sollte aber nicht einen kritischen journalismus verhindern

5287242 the last time there was this level of buzz in the high desert north of los angeles was in 2004 for the spaceshipone suborbital flights

5287255 a lot of people like to be babied its just natural to want to go back to a simpler time when you had no worries or cares
5287256 you have your strongest climaxes when you potty i think that if it feels good and youre not hurting anyone just go for it
5287257 what would i do without you ohh that feels so nice you have such nice hands and know just how to use them

5287263 its no secret we have a retention problem we think that will help our retention problem students will be more comfortable they will be able to handle the stress and challenges of coursework and university life
5287264 if we devote more time to that experience we believe it will not only improve what we are doing for the success of students but it will help with the retention problem
5287265 its not going to be as convenient as it was but for those two years were going to have to do it
5287266 people want to give money but they want to see what have you done so far theres nothing happening that you can visually see i think that when we say were going to start turning dirt in the spring and when that first bulldozer hits i think theyll say all right its for real well start giving you money and i think that will happen
5287267 zo wel zullen het draadje van de ondertanden eens vervangen goed
5287268 for us it is challenging because we had sambursky who was mr everything and then we had nick hill who was kind of a question mark but turned out to be phenomenal so this is the first time in arguably seven or eight years that the quarterback position is a question mark
5287269 with the quarterback situation joe is a great leader and dieker is a good quarterback
5287270 experience is definitely a plus for joe we know he has been in the fire before and can handle the pressure but our expectations are that chris can do it too he just hasnt been given the chance yet
5287271 given that the suspect returned approximately 30 minutes after the exchange of words at the traffic lights it is highly likely he lives locally
5287272 whether the designer of life was a dope a demon or a deity
5287273 from the bare conclusion of design i see no necessary major implications for our daily lives

5287279 it is not only his playing ability but his leadership ability which makes him such a great asset for us if he continues to progress and improve at the same pace which could easily happen due to his great work ethic he will be an even better player this year
5287280 they both have good size and speed and will be big play threats any time they are on the field i expect both of them to be go to guys for us in the passing game this year
5287281 we have a lot of talented players at wide receiver but most of them have had limited opportunities due to the depth we have had at the position
5287282 this year those guys will finally have their chance to get on the field and i am confident a number of them will rise to the top and be productive players for us
5287283 paul nielsen is another guy who has had some injury issues but he has outstanding physical skills and athletic ability and can also be an effective blocker and kevin golden is a versatile guy who can help us at both tight end and fullback all three of those guys will play key roles this year and give us tremendous depth
5287284 he is going to be a legitimate threat as both a runner and a receiver and that makes him hard to defend francis camara will also look to earn playing time offensive line in addition to all of the talent returning at the skill positions the crusaders return four out of five starters on the offensive line last year the line paved the way for holy cross to average 463 4 yards of total offense and 35 9 points per contest the crusaders also allowed just 14 sacks during the 2007 season while the team attempted 497 passes just one sack for every 36 5 times the team dropped back to pass leading holy cross this season will be four players who started all 11 games during the 2007 campaign senior chris smith will be back for his third year as the starting center while senior mike mccabe who played in all 11 games off the bench last season looks to take over as the fifth starter at right tackle mason olson to continue to progress after starting all of last year
5287285 the guy who emerged in the spring was mike mccabe who has good size good feet and is extremely motivated his emergence is really helping things out in that spot
5287286 not only do we have four of the five starters coming back on the line but they have all progressed both mentally and physically
5287287 they are all bigger and stronger they understand what we are doing and they work well together as a group we also have good depth this year which will provide us with some competition for playing time there are multiple guys who are capable of going out there and performing without the offense missing a beat
5287288 both of our outside linebackers are really versatile guys and we are looking for them to have great seasons
5287289 evan byrd is a great run defender as well as an outstanding pass rusher and we expect him to continue performing at a high level sean lamkin played an awful lot for us off the bench last year and we expect him to get even better as he steps into a starting role
5287290 he has the speed and the coverage skills to be the best corner in the patriot league and we have a lot of confidence in him at the other corner anthony dimichele stepped up and had an outstanding spring after playing a significant amount as a freshman he not only has the speed but is a very physical player and he is a guy who we think can have a breakout year
5287291 he has both the physical skills and the leadership skills needed to be successful the other guy who has really emerged is alex johnson who began seeing action toward the end of last season and really has a lot of potential the defensive line will be led by senior bryan walwyn who returns as a starter at one defensive end spot last season walwyn recorded 31 tackles and tied for the team lead with four sacks junior nicholas macdonald will look to take over as the other starting defensive end after posting 13 tackles and two sacks as a reserve in 2007 sophomores kevin regan should also play key roles as backups at defensive end bryan walwyn is an experienced guy who has played in every game since he has been at holy cross
5287292 he is very steady and capable of performing at a high level so we are looking for a big year out of him at the other end position nicholas macdonald played a lot last year and we expect him to step into a bigger role as a starter mude ohimor is another guy who gained some experience last year and should become a key part of the rotation
5287293 he played very well the first two games last year before his injury alex carson then came in and took over as the starter and did a good job those two along with steve buller can give us outstanding depth at nose tackle
5287294 he has worked hard to improve his range and consistency and i can only see him becoming a better kicker as a senior he has good experience and his confidence is growing and that is a huge part of being an effective kicker
5287295 he became a lot more consistent as the season went along and i expect him to get even better as a senior don lemieux have also made a lot of progress as punters and i can see both of them being factors for us
5287296 j descobri que o meu corpo de manh quer caminha
5287297 even the strongest person becomes mush when the topic turns to raises
5287298 just remember that your boss will also be uncomfortable talking about it with you
5287299 you could be the organizations powerpoint guru or possess some skill that everyone comes to you for help with
5287300 what you are effectively doing is running a marketing campaign for yourself you want to make sure youve got visibility with people other than your boss
5287301 a script will help you feel comfortable that you can objectively prove your worth to the organization
5287302 if a companys policy is to give annual raises its hard to get an exception to the rule
5287303 usually decisions come from senior management and your boss wont have any latitude to go outside the companys policy
5287304 the average person usually cant step aside from his or her emotions
5287305 also your manager may go on the defensive if you ask for a larger raise during your review
5287306 if your manager asks you what raise you have in mind you dont want to gasp and go blank
5287307 if you were offered a 3 percent raise you cant ask for 7 percent it just wont happen
5287308 if you got a 3 percent raise but want a 5 percent raise say ive accomplished xyz i possess xyz skills i put in extra time at the office and im a bit disappointed with the raise
5287309 be sure to use an i message rather than a you message it sounds less accusatory
5287310 it also may put you on top of the layoff list
5287311 talking about what someone else received really tends to turn a boss off
5287312 my big concern is that everyones so hell bent on decriminalising abortion we might forget to put in place the support and care systems that women and couples need

5287315 he was trying to swim his way to the top after an avalanche the snow turns slushy until it stops tumbling and then it packs down really hard while its still fluid you try and swim to the top

5287320 when they have me down on the table and clamp that horrible mask over my face a mere childish panic begins inside me
5287321 we begin by recognizing the role of moods and feelings they can change on a daily basis and color how we view our beliefs
5287322 we must constantly review and keep what we believe before us
5287323 is tracing a bad mood or painful moment precisely to an image concept troublesome comment or irrational belief
5287324 this is giving you a reason why you should use a particular search engine
5287325 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that if he wants to he can change flights the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5287326 he is looking forward to coming back on monday he is thinking about being free but worried about reporters he is okay but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart

5287362 the intergovernmental panel on climate changes fourth assessment report climate change 2007 presents compelling scientific proof that the worlds climate has changed because of human action and industrial growth
5287363 the ipcc which brings together the worlds leading climate scientists and experts
5287364 the ipcc would have us believe that its reports are diligently reviewed by many hundreds of scientists and that these reviewers endorse the contents of the report an analysis of the reviewers comments for the scientific assessment report by working group i show a very different and very worrying story
5287365 it is no small matter that routine weather service functionaries from new zealand to tanzania are referred to as the worlds leading climate scientists it should come as no surprise that they will be determinedly supportive of the process
5287366 most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations

5287478 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5287479 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world

5287589 there have been church books that changed my life on my mission i read then apostle spencer w kimballs the miracle of forgiveness which was so warm and open and real that it touched my heart and gave me great hope as i realized that this was a part of the gospel i was in brazil to teach
5287590 eternal life hangs in the balance awaiting the works of men this process toward eternal life is a matter of achieving perfection living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation through the perfection which comes by complying with the formula the lord gave us being perfect means to triumph over sin this is a mandate from the lord he is just and wise and kind he would never require anything from his children which was not for their benefit and which was not attainable perfection therefore is an achievable goal
5287591 repentance must involve an all out total surrender to the program of the lord that transgressor is not fully repentant who neglects his tithing misses his meetings breaks the sabbath fails in his family prayers does not sustain the authorities of the church breaks the word of wisdom does not love the lord nor his fellowmen a reforming adulterer who drinks or curses is not repentant the repenting burglar who has sex play is not ready for forgiveness god cannot forgive unless the transgressor shows a true repentance which spreads to all areas of his life
5287592 there is one crucial test of repentance this is abandonment of the sin desire is not sufficient in other words it is not real repentance until one has abandoned the error of his ways and started on a new path the saving power does not extend to him who merely wants to change his life trying is not sufficient
5287593 one of the most fallacious doctrines originated by satan and propounded by man is that man is saved alone by the grace of god that belief in jesus christ alone is all that is needed for salvation
5287594 that it is by grace that we are saved after all we can do
5287595 by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god
5287596 if we confess our sins god is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
5287597 god shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
5287598 we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in jesus christ so we also have believed in christ jesus in order to be justified by faith in christ and not by works of the law because by works of the law no one will be justified
5287599 he saved us not because of works done by us in righteousness but according to his own mercy
5287600 forgiveness costs us nothing all our costly obedience is the fruit not the root of being forgiven thats why we call it grace but it cost jesus his life that is why we call it just oh how precious is the news that god does not hold our sins against us and how beautiful is christ whose blood made it right for god to do this

5287733 the mccain campaign wants to make the election about me because the issues arent on their side
5287734 so dont get fooled by paris and britney and nasty emails that folks are sending out dont get fooled by that
5287735 the caravan that were sitting in right now is what we wanted to bring to edinburgh to tell people the story of the floods
5287736 weve performed in traditional venues before but for this show it was to get across how claustrophobic and difficult living in a caravan is
5287737 i had bought tickets because the content was very interesting having the performances in a caravan added tremendously to the impact of the show it was very powerful and i cant imagine it performed any other way
5287738 when youre that close to somebody it brings a very different perspective to a performance
5287739 it throws all your conceptions of what a normal theatre performance should be
5287740 i think its good to have a sprinkling of odd venues and performances as long as its balanced out
5287741 the unusual venues those are the things you remember but ive been to similar shows where the venue was more interesting than the performances quality
5287742 we managed to weigh it down and slide it right down into the pipe work
5287743 with a lot of coaxing and everything we managed to entice her with food and her toys to climb up the netting and we eventually managed to get her out of the pipe work
5287744 we were lucky the forecasted rain hadnt really come so there wasnt water pouring down the hillside and down the pipe work
5287745 hasta hoy nicaragua es el pa s con mayor inequidad tributaria en centroam rica y se necesita una reforma que corrija los grandes desequilibrios fiscales
5287746 una reforma tributaria es una proceso en materia de impuestos que pretende incluir ajustes cuando se observan desequilibrios
5287747 el gobierno no la ha impulsado porque esto implica la afectaci n a algunos intereses que est n vinculados a l
5287748 hay que corregir distorsiones fiscales para beneficiar a sectores que necesitan
5287749 supuestamente dicen que la hacen y luego que no esto es una expresi n de la incapacidad que tiene el gobierno para realizar una propuesta y luego consensuarla
5287750 es intolerante que la suma anual de la evasi n contrabando y exoneraciones nacionales sea equivalente a m s del triple de la cooperaci n externa
5287751 este gobierno que dice ser de los pobres debe tomar medidas para evitar una estructura inequitativa
5287752 hay diputados que est n informados y saben que la reforma toca sus intereses
5287753 la reforma tributaria vendr una vez que terminen las elecciones y ser uno de los elementos importantes del primer semestre de 2009
5287754 disminuye los sesgos anti exportadores facilita las inversiones fortalece las instituciones encargadas de recaudar los tributos y busca la neutralidad y equidad de los tributos
5287755 demuestran que a duras penas se ha logrado cierto incremento de las recaudaciones en claro detrimento de la equidad esta obsesiva captaci n de ingresos fiscales hu rfana de lo social debe sustituirse por cuatro ejes imprescindibles para la renovaci n integral de la tributaci n
5287756 no es la causa del problema fiscal que enfrenta nicaragua sino el esquema tributario excluyente y distorsionado
5287757 a m me pone nervioso eso de la reforma porque es un eufemismo para el aumento de los impuestos en momentos muy dif ciles y si venimos con una plan de reforma estrangulamos el poco dinamismo econ mico que existe en este momento
5287758 a intocables y poderosos grupos de presi n en nicaragua el 20 por ciento m s pobre de la sociedad paga el 100 por ciento m s que el promedio del pa s mientras el 20 por ciento de mayores ingresos soportan apenas el 20 por ciento menos que dicho promedio nacional
5287759 se debe actualizar la tabla del impuesto sobre la renta para dejar de castigar a los asalariados porque actualmente las personas que reciben un ingreso nico de salario son las que m s aportan y hay que corregir esa inequidad
5287760 estudios responsablemente fundamentados en lo t cnico y en lo legal demuestran las posibilidades objetivas de garantizar m s recaudaci n con estricto apego a la ley y sin menoscabo de los derechos de ning n contribuyente colocan sobre la mesa del fisco no menos de 25 millones de d lares equivalente al 0
5287761 hay que analizar los impuestos que pagan los sectores m s desprotegidos los incentivos al turismo por ejemplo que tiene los m ximos beneficios fiscales
5287762 el gobierno est haciendo un esfuerzo por hacer una nueva ley tributaria
5287763 hay aspectos del sistema tributario que no son los m s id neos como el iva que se les cobra a los asalariados hay grupos que pagan poco y tienen mayor capacidad
5287764 no creo que el gobierno est hablando muy en serio de eso si hay reforma estamos hablando de m s dinero que se transferir al estado y eso yo lo ver a con mucha sospecha

5287775 his decision making was ok for the first time of playing a whole game but i expect a lot out of quarterbacks but well see where he is
5287776 you probably dont throw that one i think he would agree
5287777 thats an awful feeling when you do something like that but i fought back and the offense fought back
5287778 it may not look pretty but i am going to try to get the job done and that is something that i have been able to do for a while
5287779 i got my toe stepped on but thats it definitely tired
5287780 that will be a tough call at the end he will be involved in that decision at the end absolutely
5287781 right now if i said anything about the roster it would be premature i like the player and his teammates like him and he produces but it is a couple of games and we have a ways to go here
5287782 ive got to go back and look at the tape i know i made some mistakes out there tonight too so im trying to learn from them trying to get better
5287783 im not going to grow any taller i mean the doctor told me i was going to be 6 2 but that didnt happen so im just working with what i got god blessed me so im just here to seize every opportunity i get

5287787 my father says that all people who died in the irish famine are still talking theyre whispering with dry lips and staring out with empty eyes he says you cant go anywhere in ireland without hearing them
5287788 in our house its dangerous to sing a song or say whats inside your head you have to be careful or else my father will get up and switch you off like a radio
5287789 didnt like my mother reading books that he didnt read first himself
5287790 i like giving the wrong answer my father sits on the far side of the table in the breakfast room and says hes going to wait until i give the right answer even if it takes all day
5287791 my father came up and stuck a piece of folded paper in the window to stop the rattling he put on the light for a minute to prove that there was no man coming through the wall then he smiled and kissed the top of my head
5287792 i love each one of you you are like no other children in the world
5287793 its no good looking back you should be looking forward youre like a blank piece of paper and you should only look forward
5287794 is that a small man was able to walk up to a big man and not be afraid
5287795 but life happens and you sort of drift apart we both had families we didnt stay as close as i would have liked
5287796 all i ask is that whoever receives this scholarship learns a little bit about billy clark and what kind of person he was
5287797 i hope whoever gets this scholarship every year is as good a person and as good a friend as billy
5287798 and if he just happens to have the same size talent and skill of mario williams
5287799 but we thank you for sharing your memories and for remembering our father
5287800 when you reach this age beam is 58 having friends is the most important thing you can have

5287802 when we were in school a lot of futures were determined by a draft lottery
5287803 we didnt do all of the things we wanted to do then so i am taking care of some of those things now

5287809 it is entirely wrong to suggest simon cawte was not paid in accordance with the rules simon cawte was employed to support caroline spelman in her role as part of the official opposition in parliament he discharged duties such as speech writing and answering correspondence relating to caroline spelmans role as the shadow local government secretary this is entirely permissable within the rules
5287810 why not the sneering contemptuous less capable and unloveable lisa
5287811 or the slippery oleagenous spike he didnt even cook anything
5287812 its the producers that insisted that contestant x stay or go
5287813 no way would tom ted or any other person on this show really want to go along with that

5287820 we built the car in nine months for a practice run which was very successful
5287821 we got good media coverage and it was great experience for the team working on a real life project
5287822 now were running five research projects during the summer with a further 10 next year the difference for cuer is that the planning and build is integrated into the students academic work which we hope will give us the edge and were already seeing some exciting results
5287823 we use microsoft office professional 2007 and project 2007 to organise the team
5287824 its especially important during the summer vacation when members arent on campus managing everyone means we have to use proper project management and project allows us to do that easily this type of project just wouldnt have been possible a few years ago
5287825 to keep our sponsors up to date we produce a number of publications and newsletters for which we use microsoft publisher
5287826 its important to encourage young people to think about sustainable transportation and to show them that engineering is exciting that it uses cutting edge technology
5287827 theres a huge amount of interest across the university and this is a new thing for us to run 10 15 projects all focused on one goal
5287828 the reason the pro tells you to keep your head down is so you cant see him laughing
5287829 it took me seventeen years to get 3 000 hits in baseball i did it in one afternoon on the golf course
5287830 golf is a game whose aim is to hit a very small ball into an even smaller hole with weapons singularly ill designed for the purpose
5287831 if i had cleared the trees and drove the green it would have been a great shot
5287832 sex and golf are the two things you can enjoy even if youre not good at them
5287833 when you point a finger at someone else you have three more pointing back at yourself

5287866 hay una preocupaci n de toda la sociedad de su seguridad su tranquilidad y su confianza es lo que le importa no ve partidos pol ticos
5287867 rechazamos que el gobierno federal se lave las manos y pretenda hacer creer que el tema del crimen organizado y el narcotr fico es un tema que corresponde a los niveles estatales y municipales consideramos fundamental que en todo el pa s haya colaboraci n y concurrencia para atender eficazmente esta problem tica pero que cada novel de gobierno asuma su responsabilidad y ning n partido intente sacar raja electoral
5287868 es fundamental revisar c mo se relajaron las medidas y la eficacia desde el r gimen del presidente vicente fox quesada me parece que el crecimiento del narcotr fico y el crimen organizado durante el tiempo del presidente fox fue muy claro

5287905 almost certain to make his choice in the next few days
5287906 if obama wants to hold the suspense of the press corps and the country hell probably wait until the convention itself maybe the weekend before maybe the sunday before maybe during the convention particularly if the pick is a big name a name that will generate excitement hed be wise to wait

5287919 den sch lerinnen und sch lern der sophie scholl schule aus fl rsheim und denen der wigbertschule aus h nfeld m chte ich zu ihrer wirklich prima leistung bei den beiden schulischen nichtraucherwettbewerben gratulieren
5287920 wer an den wettbewerben teilnimmt verzichtet nicht nur auf das rauchen sondern setzt sich aktiv und intensiv mit dem thema gesundheit auseinander dass dies im klassenverband geschieht und wettbewerbscharakter hat bei der sich eine gemeinschaft gegenseitig verpflichtet auf nikotin zu verzichten st rkt diese erfahrung
5287921 wir brauchen jugendliche die sich f r ihre eigene gesundheit und die anderer einsetzen handlungskompetent sind und eine vorbildfunktion einnehmen
5287922 hier wird auf eindrucksvolle weise demonstriert dass durchdachte gesundheitsf rderung berall dort besonders gut funktionieren kann wo motivierte sch lerinnen und sch ler mitmachen
5287923 dies und die tatsache dass wir hierzu heute wieder eine feierlich preisverleihung begehen f hrt mich zum dank an all die lehrkr fte die die wettbewerbe vor ort begleiten die die gesundheitsf rderung in zusammenarbeit mit dem im kultusministerium angesiedelten projektb ro
5287924 die tatsache dass nicht nur in schulen und an anderen ffentlichen orten wie flugh fen oder bahnh fen vielfach nicht geraucht wird und dass auch im ausland das nichtrauchen immer st rker fu fasst unterst tzt nichtraucher kampagnen wie die sch lerwettbewerbe aber nicht nur das es ist auch wichtig dass wir als land hier einen starken und namhaften partner an unserer seite wissen der unser engagement unterst tzt
5287925 es freut mich dass es gelungen ist diese lesereihe f r unsere schulen zu organisieren
5287926 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
5287927 in recent weeks weve seen more cost price inflation in fresh and chilled foods as well as in some staple categories and this is adding to the cost of the weekly shopping basket
5287928 i have asked if i like here in denmark can have a cell with a television and access to a library if i go down there i enjoy reading and i have also asked if i could have pork chops twice a week normally we eat that in denmark so they should be able to meet the needs of an old man like me
5287929 the whole thing is very serious for me i go to work with a police escort because there are people out there trying to kill me but i have to keep an ironic distance from it all and i try to bring some humor into the debate unfortunately it is my experience that very religious people do not possess much of a sense of humor when it is about their own religion
5287930 i will not comment on such a stupid statement i would rather use my resources to make sure that he is prosecuted he should be placed behind bars and he should be sentenced the maximum punishment possible within the law
5287931 warm summer sun shine kindly here warm southern wind blow softly here green sod above lie light lie light good night dear heart good night good night
5287932 when summer opens i see how fast it matures and fear it will be short but after the heats of july and august i am reconciled like one who has had his swing to the cool of autumn
5287933 august rushes by like desert rainfall a flood of frenzied upheaval expected but still catching me unprepared like a match flame bursting on the scene heat and haze of crimson sunsets like a dream of moon and dark barely recalled a moment shadows caught in a blink like a quick kiss one wishes for more but it suddenly turns to leave dragging summer away

5287937 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5287938 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation

5287942 we came here with a good car and found a good set up straight away carlin and my mechanics have done a great job so i have to thank them to win both races here makes up for the disappointment of the second race at spa brendon is usually very quick at the start so im not sure what happened to him all i know is that i was into the first corner first and was able to control the race from there hopefully we can hold on to the championship lead for the last few races and win the championship in my first year
5287943 every time i think about back home its cool and breezy i wish that i could be there right now just passing time

5287980 at midnight these poor fellows lying here and there all over this place will begin to mourn and mutter and lament and make outcries and if this commotion should disturb henry it will be bad for him therefore ask the physician on watch to give him an eighth of a grain of morphine but this is not to be done unless henry shall show signs that he is being disturbed
5287981 it is a good many years ago have you told it several times since
5287982 well strike an average how many times a year do you think you have told it
5287983 well i have told it as many as six times a year possibly oftener
5287984 very well then youve told it well say seventy or eighty times since it happened
5287985 now then mark a very extraordinary thing happened to me a great many years ago and i used to tell it a number of times a good many times every year for it was so wonderful that it always astonished the hearer and that astonishment gave me a distinct pleasure every time i never suspected that that tale was acquiring any auxiliary advantages through repetition until one day after i had been telling it ten or fifteen years it struck me that either i was getting old and slow in delivery or that the tale was longer than it was when it was born mark i diligently and prayerfully examined that tale with this result that i found that its proportions were now as nearly as i could make oat one part fact straight fact fact pure and undiluted golden fact and twenty four parts embroidery i never told that tale afterwards i was never able to tell it again for i had lost confidence in it and so the pleasure of telling it was gone and gone permanently how much of this tale of yours is embroidery
5287986 i dont know i dont think any of it is embroidery i think it is all just as i have stated it detail by detail
5287987 then it is all right but i wouldnt tell it any more because if you keep on it will begin to collect embroidery sure the safest thing is to stop now
5287988 i cant tell you how important i think it is that you continue what you are doing
5287989 the defenders of the status quo are the ones who have dug us into this hole
5287990 so often fooled into finding a remedy for a problem
5287991 the engines of distraction and the great concentrated power of communication that youve seen turned on this issue or that issue is already hard at work
5287992 were back from al gores big global warming speech and boy did we have a great time we had a dedicated band of taxpayer advocates out in force pointing out the high economic cost of global warming alarmism starting with 8 a gallon gasoline of course we saw plenty of hypocrisy especially the fact that gore didnt ride his bike or take public transporation to the event he didnt even take his prius instead he brought a fleet of two lincoln town cars and a chevy suburban suv even worse the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
5287993 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
5287994 oh we definitely want to move beyond petroleum and so there will be a supply side offered by the democrats and it will include everything from battery technology to making sure that we have good home domestic supply and looking as i said about moving faster on those kind of things like wind and solar that can help us with our high cost of natural gas

5287999 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5288000 i am not happy with the way politics is being played in the country especially between the apc and slpp
5288001 where are the rest this is about sierra leone this is a very serious event and policy makers must attend an event such as this
5288002 it is really sad that majority of government ministers could not come to such an important occasion to discuss the way forward in a post conflict country like ours
5288003 in fact i suggest that next time we organize such a forum we must insist that sixty per cent of the audience must be policy makers
5288004 even after i appealed to i b kargbo not to leave at the time he left because the discussion was pertinent he could not stay behind but i have told him to tell president ernest koroma that i would like to have a discussion with him on this very important topic
5288005 by initiating this lecture concord times is also sending a message to us all that james oguogou was a role model in his own right this fact is enough evidence that there are role models in the sierra leone media
5288006 let us research our stories confront its subjects with our findings before publication do not rely on retractions we should concentrate on building a profession which all citizens will respect
5288007 unless there is a vibrant educated and informed citizenry we may not be able to sustain the hard won peace in our countries

5288013 it was unlikely to provide now that the former president would be provided with the same security that he got when he was the president
5288014 an economic lean period during the second half of the year
5288015 despite general caution in estimating the growth outlook for the euro zone inflation expectations of market participants according to surveys and financial market data have been higher of late than can be reconciled with price stability over the long run
5288016 the fact that the pace of growth is likely to slow does not mean that this will be enough to counteract stability concerns nor will it automatically balance out inflationary pressures
5288017 its the duty of monetary policy to prevent increased price risks from translating into a long lasting higher inflation rate
5288018 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5288019 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5288020 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5288021 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5288022 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5288023 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5288024 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5288025 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror

5288068 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistan s history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5288069 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thoroughgoing reform of its social political and economic structures
5288070 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key the responsibilities on political leaders in pakistan are now significant they need to come together to ensure that the recently elected government carries forward an economic and security agenda consistent with the long term interests of the pakistani people
5288071 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together
5288072 the president is not answerable to any court for the exercise of power and performance of functions of their respective offices for any act done or purported to be done in the exercise of those powers and performance of those functions
5288073 there is much interest in this as the public officials and the media will attend and cover this major breakthrough for the defense

5288185 neighborhoods are becoming more and more a part of interactive search applications where location granularity matters
5288186 our relationship with skyhook wireless opens up a new ecosystem of interactive applications where location information is equal to social context
5288187 the integration of neighborhood boundary data from urban mapping into skyhooks positioning information will result in more neighborhood relevant information as part of the skyhook wireless loki service and myloki application for facebook and other social networking sites
5288188 additionally the urban mapping neighborhood data adds a richness and more context to social connections than just a city level message or plot on a map for example when our myloki service messages out that a user has changed locations we can say that the user has just checked into back bay in boston instead of just indicating that the user is in boston mass
5288189 with urban mappings robust database of neighborhood boundary data skyhook wireless can offer developers contextually relevant geocoding for the creation of location rich and enabling interactive applications
5288190 as a result were more able to meet an increasing marketplace demand for location accuracy and granularity thats driving the development of much deeper location rich interactive applications

5288196 and are impressed with their vision to continue to grow their basketball organization battle creek is a terrific market and the kellogg arena which seats 4 700 for basketball is a perfect venue for pbl games
5288197 we did a lot of due diligence in seeking out the best place for the knights to play and without question the pbl offers the greatest opportunities for our organization from a business standpoint and from an entertainment standpoint
5288198 with the addition of battle creek the team falls into our footprint geographically and creates natural rivalries with detroit chicago and quad city
5288199 we had a great car today and the team really did a great job on pit road tony made a great call to take four tires there at the end and the car really liked fresh tires today
5288200 our car liked short runs and we got a bunch of them at the end so we did a lot better

5288220 and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007

5288224 john edwards was not aware that assistance was provided to anyone involved in this matter
5288225 i did it of my own voilition and without the knowledge instruction or suggestion of john edwards or anyone else the assistance was offered and accepted without condition
5288226 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
5288227 i feel sad because i know john edwards so well
5288228 in life we all make mistakes it breaks my heart if this is going to disqualify him from being a public servant because he would be a great one
5288229 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles

5288240 when now have many non irish children playing gaelic games and bringing their own unique skills to our games i continue to urge gaa clubs to play their part in encouraging everyone whatever their nationality or denomination to become involved in our association
5288241 many clubs throughout the country already have strong integration schemes this starts with the local gaa club playing a key role in supporting gaelic games in the local primary schools
5288242 i have seen many integration programmes in my travels around ireland and i recently launched a special scheme in gort where many brazilian people reside
5288243 the face of the coin has been debased as fast as its value first the faces of gods were on the coins then the faces of kings then of presidents today its only paper the miracle is that you can still buy things with it
5288244 most committees are functioning well and the government is advancing its agenda subject to some of the compromises youd expect in a minority parliament
5288245 its a minority parliament this is how things have to be

5288248 el problema es que fronteras adentro tenemos 35 de retenciones todav a alt simos costos una inflaci n agropecuaria calamitosa y ning n tipo de soluci n de parte de quienes gobiernan

5288256 anthrax dryer a key to probe suspect borrowed device from lab
5288257 growing doubts from scientists about the strength of the governments case against the late bruce e ivins the military researcher named as the anthrax killer are forcing the justice department to begin disclosing more fully the scientific evidence it used to implicate him
5288258 the case is built from a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence and for a case this important its troubling to have so many loose ends
5288259 some of the governments public statements appeared incomplete or misleading
5288260 federal investigators probing the deadly 2001 anthrax attacks recovered samples of human hair from a mailbox in princeton n j but the strands did not match the lead suspect in the case
5288261 were assigned to produce an in depth reconstruction of the case that would reexamine all avenues of the investigation
5288262 persistent inaction in the face of the clients gross misconduct
5288263 was nearly faded out a mishap said to have been caused many years ago by taking a copy by the anastatic process
5288264 an anastatic copy on parchment from the original for all historical purposes more important than the original as to make this they allowed the original document to be placed under a certain process which enabled the projectors of the scheme to take a facsimile from the original that this outrage was perpetrated on the original declaration only too plainly shows as it is so faded as to be hardly discernible to the naked eye and from which they were enabled to take a few impressions this therefore really portrays more truthfully what the document was than the original itself
5288265 this is a truly significant historic find especially since no one knew it even existed
5288266 it answers the mystery of what happened to the original declaration americas national treasure it certainty deserves to be described as priceless far more than any 80 million painting
5288267 an extraordinary discovery with a terrific story behind it this priceless and rare example is the only direct copy of the original declaration ever made and the fact that the resultant damage to the original makes another copy impossible amplifies its importance
5288268 the detective work involved in tracing the significance of the obscure short lived anastatic technique that made this faithful duplication possible enriches the story of this national treasure
5288269 ive always been passionate about writing and i wanted to give a voice to my brothers life and for people like him
5288270 the premiers blue mood became the biggest hit dig records ever had even though it tailed to make the national charts

5288272 maar je kunt er ook de demonstratie over de werking van de stabilizers op mij grand banks bijzetten haha
5288273 its been incredible to watch and it has made a lot of teams sit up and take notice
5288274 even with half the budget they would still get the same results
5288275 weve kind of just been preparing for this all this year chris as well he knew he was going for three
5288276 i suppose you do get greedy in a way but its not wrong to be greedy when it comes to sport all along the focus has been three gold medals so if we came away with one each wed probably be a bit disappointed
5288277 imagination is the beginning of creation you imagine what you desire you will what you imagine and at last you create what you will
5288278 the honour and dignity of the country will be affected and in my view the honour of the office of president will also be affected
5288279 it eliminates all the uncertainty in the market and i think the political uncertainty is coming to an end
5288280 the government will hopefully start concentrating on the economy from an economic point of view they have no excuses now and they have to perform
5288281 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people
5288282 i have never seen such a big rally in srinagar
5288283 i couldnt resist coming out to demand freedom from india
5288284 to intervene and help us in achieving the right to self determination
5288285 does evil exist and if so should we ignore it negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
5288286 next the statesmen will invent cheap lies putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked and every man will be glad of those conscience soothing falsities and will diligently study them and refuse to examine any refutations of them and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just and will thank god for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self deception
5288287 the most important thing i believe is togetherness we are nearly there and we are 99 9 there every single player except one who is contracted to the club was in the changing room at the end
5288288 some were asked and some were not but six took on their own back to be in because it hurts but one didnt that one person can spoil the rest
5288289 i dont expect the supporters to care about that but if you have been with a team that has won something everybody has to be together that one can get into two or three peoples heads and causes problems i thought it was gone and the situation has come up again
5288290 i am not stupid if we dont win the next two games there will be people banging on the windows calling for my head that is part and parcel of the job i am confident something will click and when it does we will be fine
5288291 those are my precious children being slain for your entertainment i died on the cross for them
5288292 at the same time the reintroduction of wildlife is beneficial to the environment restoring biodiversity and contributing to the ecosystem stability
5288293 sundays confrontations killed 23 ltte terrorists and 46 were wounded
5288294 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5288295 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5288296 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5288297 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles

5288309 deaths of four iraqi prisoners during the battle in fallujah on nov 9 2004
5288310 why are we doing this what do we hope to achieve
5288311 these things are crucial for all organizations to be thinking about
5288312 so that businesses are approaching the use of social technologies in a more strategic way and not just throwing things up and seeing what sticks
5288313 raise the cost of living and injure the great majority of our citizens
5288314 obviously last year we would have been ecstatic to have this finish
5288315 now we are disappointed or at least i am its a double edged sword were happy about having a good points day and a solid run in the top five all day but were disappointed we didnt have a shot at the win at the end
5288316 thats one thing that we can walk away being happy about its frustrating you want to win one of these races so bad and you think you have an opportunity to and you dont capitalize on it im really proud of the red bull toyota team we did a good job all day it was a great points day we just have to go get them next week
5288317 we felt like we had a car capable of winning
5288318 we chased the track a little bit i think everybody did we didnt chase it quite fast enough the track continued to get looser and looser and we didnt keep up with it quite as fast as we needed to add comment
5288319 exista unele momente in viata rare dar de nu atat de o intensitate exceptionala cat de o calitate noua proaspata si tocmai de aceea placut frapanta in care simti ca marele joc te a exclus din lista favoritilor si evident intr un mod elegant te a trecut pe indezirabila banca a rezervelor
5288320 cu mana mea le am omorat am privit cum mor am vrut sa scot ultimul strop de viata din acele cuvinte sa le arunc in adancul sanului mut al nemuririi sa fiu sigura ca nu se mai intorc in veci prezenta lor doare ca o mie de bice arzatoare lipsa lor sfarama orice strop de sentiment din mine s au intors din adancul linistit puternice ma bantuie prezenta lor aroma lor coplesitoare simt mangaierea lor dar cand incerc sa le cuprind nu gasesc decat orizontul rece si neinduplecat aud cand dorm cum ma cheama parca soptind de zeci de ori ma trezesc noaptea liniste continuu se joaca in mintea mea epuizata ma subjuga si ma parasesc a nimanui o visez cum ele ajung in altarul inimii mele dar demonii mei nu vor sa le lase ard ca inima focului etern dar nu am lumina bajbai neajutorata si plang cu sangele mi caci imi platesc pacatul pana la sfarsit
5288321 m am uitat spre cer m a orbit lumina ochii mi lacrimau
5288322 se trezise intr o dimineata parca in mod brusc dupa un somn indelung si in jurul sau nu vedea decat peretii de gheata intrezarea prin ei cum in jur cumva restul lumii avea un puls atat de puternic in timp ce ea pierduse ritmul

5288520 it would surprise many americans to learn that the worlds greatest deliberative body passes the overwhelming majority of legislation without any debate at all democrats think they are entitled to pass bills without debate or votes and theyve tried to ram them through right before recess to pressure us to give up but senators shouldnt fear debate on these important bills its in the best traditions of our republic to demand the senate actually do its job and have a public debate on bills that expand government and increase the burden on taxpayers senator reid can complain all he wants but republicans represent millions of americans whose voices are being silenced by democrat strong arm tactics

5288525 there is little disagreement now in europe about the nature of the new russia
5288526 i dont see europe prepared to go to war with itself over georgia
5288527 the european foreign ministers sense this is too big for them and they will in the end align themselves with the united states while trying to affect policy

5288541 they obviously dont teach cold war history at the law schools at columbia in new york or george washington in the nations capital otherwise georgias president mikheil saakashvili who attended both institutions would have thought twice about encouragement from the us for his ill fated attack on south ossetia a week ago
5288542 hungarian language programs broadcast news of the unfolding political and military drama in budapest as the radio station advised on tactics of armed resistance
5288543 i dont believe for a moment there was a carefully rounded us plot to lure putin into his foray into south ossetia maybe as cover for an impending attack on iran
5288544 mccains chief foreign policy advisor a rabid hawk called randy scheunemann has until recently worn two hats acting as mccains lead foreign policy man and also as a lobbyist for georgia
5288545 so scheunemann indubitably had the ears of both saakashvili and of mccain
5288546 equally rabid is zbigniev brzezinski a sometime advisor to obama and a veteran cold warrior from the carter presidency of the 1970s
5288547 so is the electorate ready to be pushed into mccains column on the grounds that he can stand up to the russians
5288548 obama is certainly having a bad month eerily reminiscent of john kerrys bad summer four years ago
5288549 for the moment a big slice of the us electorate is glued to the tv watching the olympics their mind is not on russia but on china they couldnt care less about georgia or south ossetia as for the bush administration it is too late to be playing some complicated piece of poker along brzezinskian lines back in may so haaretz is now reporting the us specifically warned israel not to attack iran and denied that country weapons and equipment it might use for such an enterprise bush doesnt necessarily want to go out in a blaze of guns
5288550 luego de evaluar diferentes actos creemos que milli vanilli es el nico d o que posee una calidad vocal id ntica a la de la hermosa lin
5288551 uno de los integrantes del d o audicion la semana pasada ante miembros del comit que enviamos a alemania y lo que escuchamos fue que sus destrezas vocales no han cambiado en nada durante todos estos a os nuestros enviados quedaron bien impresionados
5288552 de milli vanilli el cual contiene todas las canciones incluidas en su
5288553 aunque sus voces est n igualitas nos preocupa un poco que ya no bailen como antes de hecho aunque no lo vieron durante la audici n hay rumores de que muerto de miedo con esto de la ceremonia de cierre es que hace a os que no baila cualquiera se pone nervioso
5288554 por si acaso vemos que sus destrezas como bailar n han pasado a mejor vida el mismo equipo t cnico que dise nuestro espect culo de fuegos artificiales ya est preparando las grandes sorpresas de la noche que incluyen la presentaci n de justin timberlake en un dance off contra usher rihanna cantando a d o con beyonc y el final del show que janet jackson empez en el super bowl hace par de a os
5288555 yo la verdad que no entiendo cu l es el problema qu parte de fuegos artificiales no entiendes
5288556 nuestros n meros no mienten en esa encuesta entrevistamos er que diga 1 325 563 000 personas y todas dijeron que nunca hab an visto una ceremonia as fue todo un xito
5288557 adem s lo nico que hicimos fue arreglar las tomas un poco para que pudiesen apreciarse mejor porque el despliegue de pirotecnia que vieron fue real no escatimamos en gastos con los fuegos artificiales que usamos
5288558 finalmente se nos dio la oportunidad que tanto hemos esperado para demostrar que somos el mejor d o de estafadores en la industria musical
5288559 al fin puedo volver a lo que me gusta lucir bien fabu bailando y meneando mi pelo mientras cojo de est pida a mi audiencia
5288560 luego de casi veinte a os desde que nos mangaron en la pifia y nos quitaron injustamente nuestros grammys la actuaci n de las chinitas estas comprueba que el p blico finalmente est preparado para aceptar un acto como el nuestro
5288561 a nosotros lo que nos mat fue que en vez de contar con sofisticados equipos como los que usan justin timberlake britney spears y esencialmente todas las estrellas actuales del pop para hacer lip syncing lo que ten amos eran los porquer as de discos de vinil tocados en platos con agujas que brincaban de na en plena actuaci n
5288562 sta es la oportunidad que hemos estado esperando para revivir nuestra carrera yo pensaba que bamos a morirnos esperando
5288563 que ese cabr n se mat no en balde no me contesta las llamadas desde hace como 10 a os pero nada aunque est muerto no veo c mo eso pueda alterar la calidad de nuestro espect culo o sea no es como si fu ramos a extra ar su voz verdad

5288580 fda has concluded that an adequate margin of safety exists for bpa at current levels of exposure from food contact uses
5288581 science creates these products and science must inform us of their risks with regard to bpa thus far the science fda has reviewed does not justify recommending that anyone discontinue using these products
5288582 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
5288583 there seems to be a current difference of opinion between the scientific research field and the folks doing risk assessment if you were to sum it up in an easy relatively conservative way the scientific data points to some reason for caution at low concentrations there really isnt much information regarding the effects on human populations directly

5288597 strong global demand for resources continues to provide cost challenges for the whole industry this is mainly due to rising prices for inputs such as diesel coke and explosives and shortages of skilled labour

5288601 what sibel revealed to us and has been revealing little by little since january is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the us to procure nuclear designs and parts for the aq khan network and it was done not through pakistani intelligence directly but through the turkish embassy turkish businessmen who got the information and gave it to turkish military attaches who then turned it over to the isi and from there went on to the nuclear black market to procure these parts and designs high government us officials helped facilitate turkish israeli phd students to get into nuclear facilities in the us they worked with the rand corporation as well some moles with rand to help get this information there was at least one american company giza technologies that was helping with parts probably there were others and this thing went on from 1995 at least until 2002 and it could still be going on when this operation was shut down by the dept of defense and the state dept now sibel tells us that high government officials inside those two departments defense and state were involved in this ring she has named them on her website at least she has not named them she has photographs of people other bloggers have named them
5288602 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy

5288613 our thoughts and prayers are with his family friends and colleagues
5288614 the soldiers told us they had an order from putin leave or be killed
5288615 they said putin has given us an order that everyone must be either shot or forced to leave they told us we should ask the americans for help now because they would kill us if we stayed
5288616 the general security situation in kilinochchi and mullaittivu districts remains volatile with ongoing military operations and advancing of the army
5288617 i think every parent out there that has ever seen their child have a tough moment is thinking what can i possibly do for you
5288618 this is one of the fundamental things of the olympic games in the vast vast majority of sports there is no attention there is no glamour in the four years leading up to the olympics theres only solitary dedication and in this case not completely solitary but just that handful of your teammates thats who youre in it with and then theres a moment like this those are true olympians right there
5288619 this girl is really really special sometimes in sports its just not going to be your day but you have to get up and you have to be willing to try again and i think thats what makes alicia special
5288620 i think every parent out there that has ever seen their child have a tough moment is thinking what can i possibly do for you
5288621 you know i was a guy that lost two super bowls i had two chances and lost them both so i totally understand a lot of people watching the other night wanted to give you a hug
5288622 i believe it was a total rip off and my heart is breaking for this girl i am talking about alicia sacramone how can you do this how can you do this ive never seen something similar happen in an olympic final there is no excuse for this you cant rip out a heart of a young athlete she deserves to be on the medal podium
5288623 when he went in we were like all right this is going to be a good race i remember seeing him at the 50 and being like oh my gosh wow i definitely didnt expect alain bernard to be that far ahead i had no idea what to expect it was the final 15 meters when it really got exciting for garrett weber gale and i we were going absolutely crazy behind the blocks
5288624 this is probably about the only race i could really change from this olympics every other one was perfect i definitely dont think i can complain too much it was a world record and a gold medal i did have to deal with a wardrobe malfunction
5288625 we had a little huddle and i sort of just started to kind of tear up a little bit
5288626 ill probably do some things on my own not sure how much not sure how often but ill do something to stay in the loop
5288627 what michael did wasnt good either to take that half stroke hell tell you you want to have that perfect finish but it just so happened when michael had the great acceleration at the half stroke i think that helped him a lot

5288632 we have been able to develop advanced algorithms that run inside the netezza appliance exploiting netezzas unique parallel architecture for high performance
5288633 the ndn allows iisi to productize these algorithms and deliver them to the large and growing base of netezza users
5288634 iisi has created technology solutions that not only have immediate appeal to netezza customers but also allow us to expand our reach into the spatial market this acquisition allows us to seed the market for these third party applications and will be a catalyst for creating a marketplace of offerings from our ndn members
5288635 for those economies that are in the heavy sectors for those economies that are primarily driven by local investment and local consumption we see strong performance and strong outlook

5288650 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5288651 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5288652 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5288653 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

5288656 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5288657 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

5288665 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5288666 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5288667 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves

5288690 it was a huge blow for us and it changed everything if it wasnt for the russians our lives would have been completely different
5288691 and in georgia its basically the same they are invading another country
5288692 the putin doctrine has been very much about rolling back the ukrainian and georgian revolutions and getting back to a position of malleable semi authoritarian governments that the russians are able to control
5288693 thats the aim in georgia regime change even if they stop their tanks miles from
5288694 these russians they just fight fight and fight and they just dont listen to reason
5288695 its incredible to think the united states would risk a direct military confrontation with russia for poland or another country in the region
5288696 those with a bmi between 18 5 and 24 9 were considered at a healthy weight those with a bmi between 25 and 29 9 were considered overweight and those with a bmi of 30 or higher were considered obese

5288699 de situatie op de kamermarkt is momenteel vergelijkbaar met die van vorig jaar momenteel zijn er in leuven net als vorig jaar op hetzelfde tijdstip nog een kleine 1 000 kamers beschikbaar eind september bleven er daarvan nog 200 a 300 over er is dus geen schaarste huurprijs de huurprijzen liggen onder meer daardoor slechts 3 4 procent hoger dan vorig jaar momenteel betaal je alle kosten inbegrepen gemiddeld 245 a 250 euro huur per maand
5288700 met de nieuwe projecten komt daar dus ongeveer 10 procent bij
5288701 het is moeilijk je iemand voor de geest te halen die nog beter ge ntegreerd is dan rothman

5288719 valencia is often thought of as a temporary race venue
5288720 however it is actually a permanent street circuit which is quite fast and flowing its not like the type of street circuit that we have been used to racing around in monaco its is going to be a medium to low downforce track with a couple of quick corners which will present a very challenging circuit in an exciting environment
5288721 one of the key aspects is that it is going to be very windy
5288722 the americas cup is held in valencia for this very reason however such conditions could make achieving a good balance on the cars quite tricky
5288723 the council surveyors came and dug a hole to find out where the pool was then dug a trench down the side of the garden
5288724 that was almost three weeks ago the council should have done something about it a long time ago its like a landfill site the council should act now
5288725 we have been told it is contaminated but all the council seems to have done is put a fence up around it
5288726 im worried about the health implications for my children they could catch something from it
5288727 normally they would be in the garden but im having to take them out every day
5288728 we are certain the previous tenants attempted to create a swimming pool in their garden and then filled it in with junk
5288729 we dont know what it is and have no reason to suspect it is dangerous but we are treating it with caution
5288730 when you have a muscle cramp it helps take the pain away
5288731 if i dont work i get sick i dont like to take it easy i like to get things done
5288732 we are going into every sector we can because cambodia needs every sector to grow
5288733 after that well see in what industry we want to be an asian player
5288734 i think people in macao should be looking here not us looking there
5288735 i am a businessman and just dont have any of that political ambition
5288736 from outside people can make any statement they want but those investors who actually come here realise that cambodia is a place where they should do business
5288737 it might seem strange but i dont think hell ever move from here perhaps its a mix of feng shui good luck and superstition
5288738 im single because when youre a workaholic you dont have time for that he grins
5288739 i make joint ventures with international companies not cambodian ones
5288740 in the late 1980s australia was a very discriminatory society
5288741 hey whats the name of that book that im reading that you bought for me
5288742 all this suffering has made me stronger made me see that i had to be somebody
5288743 we will increase from seven to 10 percent by october because of the high price of construction materials
5288744 we have just constructed the internal concrete roads the gate and some building infrastructure but we have sold about 60 percent of the units
5288745 the hotels and guesthouses cannot meet the demand of tourists in the high season so what happens when investors business people and engineers who come to work in sihanoukville and in the economic zones need places to live

5288749 the slowdown only started to hurt us recently but we expect demand for clothing to fall further
5288750 electricity costs were about five percent of total costs a few years ago and seven percent in july 2007 but they are now 10 15 percent
5288751 trucks are refusing to go to the port unless they have full containers this is slowing the process down and leading to expensive delays
5288752 cambodia has lost its reputation because of too many unions and too many strikes
5288753 a chinese worker produces 100 to 120 shirts per hour a vietnamese worker produces 60 to 70 shirts per hours and a cambodian worker produces between 30 and 40 shirts per hour
5288754 international buyers have put a lot of pressure on us before they gave us 90 days to deliver now they give us only 60 days if we dont deliver they choose other countries like bangladesh
5288755 the number of factories has actually increased and everyone is employing more workers
5288756 cambodia also has preferential trade access to the west with lower taxes and quotas
5288757 there is nothing of an international standard in phnom penh right now
5288758 we class grade a as having at least 1 000 square metres of floor space quality mechanical engineering such as high speed lifts efficient buildings and car parks but thats a loose definition we dont see anything in phnom penh meeting those standards
5288759 it is hard to say exactly how much pent up demand is there but in the next five years if 150 000 square metres of office space hit the market i dont think it would be saturated
5288760 phnom penh is like ho chi minh city eight or 10 years ago i expect strong growth for the next two to three years
5288761 in march offices were renting for about us 10 per metre three months before it was 7 and now space is going for 14
5288762 there are a lot of companies coming to cambodia and most of the growth is from korean companies
5288763 the quality is not up to international standards but it is acceptable for offices

5288789 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5288790 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5288791 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5288792 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5288793 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5288794 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5288795 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5288796 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5288797 the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe

5288803 if you look at the last two goals youd probably say they were typical bolton goals
5288804 set pieces are something we practice a lot and we know how important they can be
5288805 were happy to have got the three points because we know how we started last season and it cost us
5288806 it gives us confidence and shows we have pushed on from the last five games of last season we are undefeated in six now
5288807 i dont read the papers that much but i heard what was said
5288808 thats the way it is you have people who like you you have people who think you havent made the right choice it is football you get praise you get criticised this kind of thing spurs me on
5288809 i was really satisfied with my performance and especially with the team we played really well in the first 45 minutes
5288810 stoke were tough and dangerous at corners and with throw ins but i think we played a good defensive game
5288811 it takes pressure off my shoulders but i know i have to keep scoring goals
5288812 there is going to be a full investigation into this
5288813 i dont want to comment further until i fully understand it because there are some mixed messages going round
5288814 there was a risk assessment prepared beforehand and that was passed by everyone so we need to investigate to see what happened
5288815 we have no need to interfere with the commercial activities of the club and that event was risk assessed anyway
5288816 the parachutist said a gust of wind had blown him off course
5288817 my take is that he slowed coming into land so he could do a bit of show boating but he drifted on to the roof
5288818 he was very embarrassed when we got him down and his colleagues were waiting for him
5288819 with it being burnleys first game of the season at home the crowd werent very happy with it being delayed
5288820 but they gave a big cheer when he was helped down and im sure it all raised a few smiles
5288821 o come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods in his hand are the deep places of the earth the strength of the hills is his also the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry land o come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord our maker for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand

5289032 i was confident today because my bike was fast from friday practice and with jeremy we made a small modification to the front after warm up to allow me to be a bit faster in some sections and it worked very well i lost about half a second getting past hopkins at the start and casey was incredibly fast at that stage like hed already done ten laps for a short time i was worried but then after two laps i understood that my bike was working very well and that i was fast enough to try to catch him i had closed a little bit already and gradually the red bike was becoming a bit bigger in front of me and i think this is when he started to push harder and made his mistake i was anticipating a very hard battle if i did catch him so when i saw the red bike slide out i could hardly believe it this made things a lot easier for me after that i just enjoyed riding my bike my bridgestone tyres worked very well until the end and my m1 felt very good of course i cant count this as a complete victory because casey fell and i am sorry for him but this is racing and i have to be happy with this result we are 50 points clear which is a lot and i am very excited to be going to misano in this situation however we know that 50 points is still not always enough when you have someone as strong as casey and so we wont relax now we have two days of testing and we will try some new electronics in order to help me open the throttle earlier and also of course test some bridgestone tyres
5289033 of course this is a very important victory for us and were very happy today its clear that valentino did a very good job at the start not to let stoner get too far ahead and he was starting to make up ground and put some pressure on him when he unfortunately crashed of course this made our job a lot easier we need to keep going like this and not lose our concentration but weve had two very good races and we are confident that we are in good shape we have two days of testing now which will be very important for the final six races and then we go to another home race at misano and try to make up for last year
5289034 this race is a bit sad for me because we have the potential to do a lot better however considering what has happened this weekend and above all the problems with the front tyre i think we have done almost as much as we could at the start i didnt want to take too many risks and i could feel that the front tyre was getting worse on each lap but on the other hand the rear tyre was getting better each lap i know that we have had had problems this weekend but i know that michelin are working very hard so now we will try to use the test to make some improvements i want to say thank you to all of my team for their hard work congratulate valentino for his victory and finally also toni elias for his podium
5289035 today we couldnt have done any better than this but we cant be satisfied to finish tenth but overall jorge did a great job and a good race and he was able to find a good rhythm in the middle part of the race continue until to the end and pass many riders plus he was able to score some valuable points motivation in our team is still high because we have many more races to do and tomorrow at the test we will start again to work very hard with michelin look at the problems we have had here and try to find a way to improve things for the remaining races
5289036 it was a difficult race and the result is clearly not where we want to be i dont want to be fighting at the back of the top 15 and neither does my team or yamaha and it is disappointing all i can do is go out there with whatever i have got underneath me and give it my maximum and i did that but this team and yamaha deserve to be higher up and today wasnt good enough it would be easy to let my head drop but i have never been that type of rider and i am not going to start now i was reasonably happy with my start but i had a few moments with the front tyre on the first couple of laps and i soon realised that i was at my maximum and that i wasnt going to be able to do much more it is disappointing because i have slipped out of the top ten in the standings and that was one of my big goals before the start of the season we have got to keep working hard as a team and hope that michelin can quickly turn it around for the rest of the season so we can try and get back into that top ten and keep the morale up of the team colin had even more problems than me so it must have been tough for him but this is the situation we are in we will all keep pushing hard and see what we can do
5289037 i could see straightaway behind james that he was having some issues with the front tyre which we expected i still thought i could put a good pace together but it never happened i just didnt have the confidence i needed to push harder with the tyres and the more i pushed i didnt seem to go much faster james was able to leave me pretty easily as my issues started to get worse but i wanted to stay out there and try my best for my guys at tech 3 and yamaha who as always have been working like crazy to help me this weekend i thank them for that but there was nothing else i could do towards the end i just decided to take a few more risks and i went a bit quicker but there was no way i was going to catch anybody ive had a bad run lately but im still in contention for fourth in the championship and ill keep fighting but we need big improvements from michelin the good start we had to the season seems like a long way away now and we have to work with michelin to try and solve some of the issues because i didnt enjoy today at all
5289038 we thought the disappointment of laguna seca would be forgotten after the summer break and we would have a positive weekend in brno unfortunately from the very beginning of the weekend we understood it was going to be another tough weekend clearly we couldnt challenge the tyre opposition we have been trying a lot of different settings to try and cope with that but it was difficult the most difficult was qualifying in the rain conditions and we were far behind we knew starting from the last two rows it would be a tough race but james and colin still tried as hard as they could and they stayed on track and scored a few points but this is not how we started the championship and today was a really difficult day to see the chequered flag with a few points is a relief but for sure there will be a lot of meetings and a lot of thinking of what to do for the future because we keep on losing ground in the championship and this is very disappointing

5289116 het volkskrantblog leidt regelmatig tot onverwachte verschijnselen zo heeft ook goedmakers vaker nieuwe toepassingen bedacht van dit blog hij poneerde een tijdlang stellingen waarop anderen konden reageren via het aanbevelingssysteem dat we hanteerden en nu kopieert hij een idee van de bbc door fotos z nder een onderschrift te plaatsen en zijn bezoekers uit te nodigen om daarbij het bijschrift te bedenken ik vind dit mooie ontwikkelingen ze tonen voor mij aan dat het volkskrantblog een eigen leven begint te leiden en dat het zich een plaats verovert in het leven van de gebruikers

5289128 by jerome corsi the bulk of the criticism from the left in particular is about the author and not the actual writings im no defender of corsi let me be clear he seems to me to be one fork short of a place setting but nonetheless the book is out and flying off the shelves
5289129 again im not defending corsi much of what he writes is troubling and fictional but that doesnt mean that the obama campaign shouldnt hew closer to the truth and yes i do have higher expectations of them
5289130 i dont think you beat obama by saying that hes paris hilton the more important thing is really to look at is he who he says he is a reformer
5289131 its not that obama is a bad person its just that hes like all the rest of them not a reformer not a messiah just like all the rest of them in washington and just like all the other liberals too
5289132 it was a huge blow for us and it changed everything if it wasnt for the russians our lives would have been completely different
5289133 and in georgia its basically the same they are invading another country
5289134 the putin doctrine has been very much about rolling back the ukrainian and georgian revolutions and getting back to a position of malleable semi authoritarian governments that the russians are able to control
5289135 thats the aim in georgia regime change even if they stop their tanks miles from
5289136 these russians they just fight fight and fight and they just dont listen to reason
5289137 its incredible to think the united states would risk a direct military confrontation with russia for poland or another country in the region

5289165 the benefits of voip are many but one of the largest is the ability to reduce a business costs in particular long distance costs
5289166 a small business with 10 to 19 employees can save an average of 8 000 in the first year by using a voip phone system
5289167 i have to say it is 1 000 times easier than the pbx system we had before
5289168 i can make changes to the system simply and quickly before i had to call in an outside tech wait several days and it often cost us money to do simple things like add a phone for a new staff member
5289169 our employees spend the majority of their time out of the office at client job sites but the call forwarding capabilities make it much easier for customers to reach us without trying multiple numbers
5289170 this helps set us apart from many of our competitors and also gives our customers the impression that comenity will be around indefinitely to service their needs

5289178 we are taking a giant step forward toward developing a health care system that focuses on quality and affordability through the implementation of health information technology
5289179 the greatly expanded icd 10 code sets will enable hhs to fully support quality reporting pay for performance bio surveillance and other critical activities conversion to icd 10 is essential to development of a nationwide electronic health information environment and the updated x12 transaction standards are a critical step in the implementation of these new codes
5289180 now is the right time to move forward with the transition from icd 9 to icd 10
5289181 we recognize that the transition to icd 10 will require some upfront costs but each year of delay would create additional costs both because of the limitations of icd 9 and because of the need to employ the greater precision that icd 10 codes provide to support value based purchasing of health care and other initiatives we will continue to work collaboratively across the health care system to ensure a smooth transition to use of the updated transaction standards and icd 10
5289182 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5289183 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5289184 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5289185 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5289186 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
5289187 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games

5289190 most of our clients were moving to an soa and web services architecture integrating many different applications into their external web site for example the sonic esb allowed us to implement customer client business processes with zero manual effort that is perhaps our biggest payback
5289191 two important business goals for the next 12 months include adding to our client base and improving the end user experience the sonic esb is helping mccamish achieve and ultimately exceed these goals
5289192 mccamish systems is a great example of a longstanding user of the progress openedge business application development platform and a progress application partner that sees the operational and financial value in implementing a services based architecture
5289193 mccamish was very comfortable with the openedge platform and found the sonic esb to be the cost effective choice in helping them deliver reliable and high quality service as a result mccamishs partners can introduce new insurance products rapidly and seamlessly while maintaining product profitability

5289208 vendors like ourselves of assets will find that it makes sense to try and put together the package in order that a wide variety of buyers have access to debt finance
5289209 given that the credit market is so difficult it is necessary to put together a group of often a large number of banks to fund these larger transactions

5289214 he was a senior administrator for a pedophile website and was effectively a librarian for the storing and distribution of indecent images of children
5289215 todays sentence reflects how seriously the criminal justice system views those who take gratification from the sexual abuse of children
5289216 this website whilst appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for pedophiles

5289220 russia has used massive and disproportionate force against an independent and sovereign democracy
5289221 this is completely unacceptable under international law and we and our allies must not beat around the bush in condemning russia very clearly it looks increasingly as if russia intends to topple the elected government of georgia and to try and cripple that country
5289222 appropriate nondiscriminatory treatment to all transgender and gender variant individuals
5289223 this trend underscores the need for psychologists to acquire greater knowledge and competence in addressing transgender issues
5289224 psychologists who work with clients with gender identity issues are not of one mind on this issue
5289225 accordingly if there were evidence showing the gid diagnosis to be similarly harmful and discriminatory against gender variant transgender or transsexual people there would be a precedent for a resolution discouraging psychologists from using this diagnosis
5289226 however there is a great deal of disagreement about the gid diagnosis and whether it is helpful or harmful therefore the task force does not recommend that apa take a position on gid at this time
5289227 how certain factors traditionally considered risk factors can be reconceptualized as adaptive or protective processes
5289228 institutional racism and societal prejudice place all african american youth including well resourced youth at some degree of risk
5289229 understanding what makes them strong requires acknowledging their experience here in the united states and how discrimination affects their daily lives the study of success is just as important as the study of failure
5289230 we welcome the key findings of this paper it highlights the importance of training and support for healthcare staff in delivering fundamental essential care and services to older people
5289231 more importantly it also emphasises the need for more government action through the recruitment and retention of specialist nurses as well as adequate funding to increase the level of services available to our most vulnerable citizens
5289232 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks
5289233 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5289234 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5289235 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5289236 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5289237 weve had attempted murders in londonderry and dungannon and spamount and now lisnaskea
5289238 im not so sure with the reduction of police resources in the province and the removal of the army that the psni have the resources at this present time to deal with this escalation and if its not nipped in the bud very quickly it will get worse
5289239 so who are using these services a high ranking amazon executive told me there are 60 000 different customers across the various amazon web services and most of them are not the startups that are normally associated with on demand computing rather the biggest customers in both number and amount of computing resources consumed are divisions of banks pharmaceuticals companies and other large corporations who try aws once for a temporary project and then get hooked

5289258 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5289259 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5289260 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan and respects the results of the election we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism

5289272 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5289273 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5289274 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5289275 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them
5289276 developing an alternative method of administering vaccine therapy that is well tolerated by most patients and produces similar immune responses to standard methods may help further the development of vaccine therapies for prostate cancer
5289277 based on safety and feasibility metronomic dosing appears to be superior to standard dosing and administration
5289278 more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this dosing method in treating prostate cancer
5289279 given all the new hair treatments out there theres a growing need to make hair feel more natural especially for women
5289280 for the first time we present an experimental setup that allows measuring the subtle forces both physical and chemical that arise when single hairs slide past each other or are pressed against each other
5289281 the findings will help provide clearer strategies for optimizing hair care products
5289282 the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair care products affect hair to hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion

5289296 the connection here is in the spirit of what we do
5289297 iris is a group of people who come from all across the country for the love of making music these kids come from across the city with one goal in mind to make music weve got a lot in common its a good partnership
5289298 why was that not together because were not breathing together lets do it again
5289299 these guys must be so dedicated to what they do
5289300 you can tell they eat sleep and breathe their instruments
5289301 hopefully they see that were all individuals with our own styles and backgrounds but we still get a sense of worth playing in an orchestra
5289302 listen to as many things as you can figure out what the player is doing and how they do it
5289303 its hard to say if this is making them better musicians
5289304 but the core of our mission is developing well rounded people they have an opportunity to interact with great musicians and talk about their favorite interest it doesnt matter that its classical music they just love music period

5289311 jeg gr der n r han ringer og bliver s ked af det han er ikke l ngere mit store idol det bliver aldrig det samme
5289312 what i think is fair i would just like to see the officer held responsible for the way he treated us
5289313 its a dog its ok you can get another one relax
5289314 bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than to defuse them
5289315 the new john mccain has embraced those kind of tactics
5289316 last week we announced that we had information about yulia tymoshenkos systematic work in the interests of russia unfortunately that information is now confirmed
5289317 we will hand over the material we have to the law enforcement bodies for detailed study
5289318 internally digiknow is being used as an alternative to a help desk
5289319 staff members now have a central repository for submitting policy procedural and human resource questions and receive an instant response in addition to our 24 7 custom call center with digiknow our members now have an online channel for submitting questions directly to truwest and receiving responses 24 7 during business hours this enables our credit union staff who would have been answering questions on the phone to focus on delivering total member service the administrative function within digiknow allows us to update responses in real time providing our members with accurate and up to date information
5289320 third party knowledge based systems tend to be cost prohibitive digital dialogue offers competitive pricing and proven technology that meet the needs of credit unions digiknow has empowered our members by giving them access to knowledge on demand which has improved our member service levels weve already had 217 inquiries submitted through digiknow
5289321 in using digiknow truwest credit union is demonstrating a commitment to increasing both member and staff loyalty levels
5289322 digiknow provides truwest credit union with an alternative to using a help desk on the internal side which allows them to better allocate staff truwest worked closely with us to design the digiknow reports they receive ensuring that the information provided would facilitate improved service levels members today demand 24 7 access to their finances and offering different avenues for sharing information with members is a competitive advantage credit unions need to survive
5289323 the introduction of clearsight s expert analysis technology for its analyzer products will equip telecom operators with a critically important tool for network compliance testing and troubleshooting
5289324 we are pleased to see clearsight s continued investment in the development of testing tools that help telecommunication operators better operate and manage their network infrastructure
5289325 it has been firmly decided that the business is staying here
5289326 i am reminded of the biobusiness center on an almost daily basis
5289327 we are very excited about server rewind because customers can have peace of mind that their site is backed up and easily restored in case of accidental deletion or data loss
5289328 plenty of providers offer discounts but what users really need is to experiment with new solutions without risk our buy one get one free deal is a great way to see the impact of using more domains without investment it is especially important for businesses to ensure that their shop window onto the world is as prominent as possible
5289329 domains are often bought with little thought at the start of an online project website owners have much to gain from regularly reviewing their domains to ensure that their website is working as hard as possible
5289330 new yorkers see a very bleak fiscal picture for the state with 85 percent of voters describing the states fiscal condition as poor or fair
5289331 and 65 percent of voters including more than three quarters of
5289332 while 43 percent of voters say they are very or somewhat confident that the governor and legislature will improve the states fiscal condition this year 55 percent of voters tell siena that they are not at all or not very confident that state leaders will effectively address the fiscal health of new york this year
5289333 while voters are divided over what the legislature and governor should do this week they are nearly unanimous in opposing tax increases to close the budget gap with 80 percent wanting to see spending cut and only 10 percent saying raise taxes
5289334 despite the states fiscal picture or maybe because of the way hes talking to voters about it david paterson has the best favorable and job performance ratings with voters hes ever had
5289335 while new york has not gone red in a presidential race since 1984 obamas lead over mccain has fallen from 18 points in june to just eight points today
5289336 certainly the dynamic in the race will change with the two conventions and the selection by both candidates of vice presidential running mates
5289337 i walked into the studio and looked up and it was almost as if otis spirit was right there
5289338 in studio a where he used to prance back and forth as he was recording and teaching the musicians the arrangements to the songs
5289339 when you walk into either exhibit youll know what otis redding was about and the legacy he left
5289340 but everyone tells a different story when you go to stax the story is more about their history theyve worked so hard to tell the story of that room and its a great part of the story
5289341 they produced and made all those hits but first and foremost it was the family of stax records it was love first and hits second
5289342 his presence was a lot like elvis presley and billy graham one of those guys who when he walks into a room the room changes
5289343 he was the same in the studio as he was on stage he marched up and down that room just like he marched up and down the stage and hed sing the horn parts to us and get in our face until we were frothing at the mouth he could instill that kind of excitement
5289344 he knew in his heart he didnt have long to discharge all this genius
5289345 and when i say genius i mean touched by god he walked into that studio knowing the song and everything in it the rhythm section the drums the horn lines
5289346 he drove a wedge in the world of music and all of us fell into it
5289347 when he was killed we dispersed it was all over for stax
5289348 i do not care islam says there cannot be anyone between allah and his disciple how come these clergymen are interfering in our matter
5289349 i wont ask anyone to go for this kind of marriage
5289350 i know its hot but thank god hes given us a breeze we are not here for our convenience but to move heaven i did not come here to have a nice meeting while is going to hell
5289351 today there is a widespread tolerance of immorality in the church from church leaders to the newest believer
5289352 god is wanting us to draw closer to him on this there is a spirit of glory about to be poured out on the church in this nation but with that must come purity
5289353 were here to pray for the restoring of the principles on which our country was founded
5289354 if we get back to praying for our leaders they might make wise and good decisions
5289355 but our lady is pregnant in this picture she is our mother
5289356 one drop of the blood of jesus forgives all the abortions in the world
5289357 by knowing exactly the point when development of the testicles is blocked we can help parents and doctors decide on the best treatment options for these kids be it hormone therapy or surgery
5289358 my wife and i decided to get behind men that are doing their best to prove themselves
5289359 if theyre coming out and we want them to turn their lives around then we need to provide opportunities and support for them
5289360 i know these men deserve to live a safe and comfortable life somewhere
5289361 but im not sure marrietta is ready for it we had picketers and people that were very angry and it was upsetting to us
5289362 he could have brought these gentlemen into town the way he should have instead of just bringing them in kind of in the dark of night and nobody knew about it
5289363 you go in knowing you are working with the poorest the outcasts
5289364 when youre there youre almost numb so you can be what you need to be at the moment
5289365 when youre there you want to be with them and just love them sometime afterwards you begin to process and deal with things experienced
5289366 we never knew what we would be going to do
5289367 there may be a door open here or there god has a plan thats better than our own you want to have structure but i think faith sometimes means not being that way its a good thing when you say you dont have to plan anymore youre just trusting
5289368 by contacting people we raised 9 000 in 10 days for the reconstruction
5289369 we saw a community come together to build the orphanage a lot of teammates and myself started to really grow that month
5289370 its not i have this message i want to tell you
5289371 i realized i was only getting my masters for money so i could have more it was not about if i have more money i could give more thats when i started looking at what i was doing
5289372 i was teaching so i thought i have the summers available for mission trips
5289373 it was for a year so i couldnt do that
5289374 but i felt like i was being pushed and called to do it
5289375 naa i have a class at 10 so im just killing time
5289376 when caring for a child with a disability families often become so focused on day to day needs that they often lose sight of the larger financial issues that loom ahead
5289377 clearly many parents need to start early and take a long term view when preparing financially for their childs financial future and weve assembled this checklist to help them get started
5289378 each day in communities across the country easter seals provides the exceptional services necessary to give people with disabilities equal opportunities to live learn work and play
5289379 we want the children with disabilities and families we serve to gain greater independence and having the right information and support to make critical long term financial decisions can make all the difference
5289380 the art and craft of gorilla suit performance and construction
5289381 with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
5289382 he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
5289383 we all knew he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
5289384 as good emergency managers we have to go forward and plan for the fhe worst
5289385 charley was a category 4 hurricane fay is a tropical storm
5289386 it may be the future but you still gotta eat
5289387 so long as companies have quarterly earnings their vision will be obstructed relationships take time
5289388 it is inconceivable that anyone will find a tax provision worth 50 to 75 for one year will make the difference between keeping and losing his or her home
5289389 the installation of curtain walling and windows has gone very well and will be completed well ahead of schedule
5289390 the summers extreme rainfall has however caused a delay in renewing the roof and caused some water damage
5289391 before pupils can return health and safety checks need to be carried out and staff need time to organise the resources that had to be moved due to rainwater coming in
5289392 up to this point the major building works have not had any effect on the life of the school
5289393 the delay in opening after the holidays is regretted but the health and safety of staff and pupils is our main concern
5289394 latin american expansion is important to serving our clients in the best way possible
5289395 with the addition of akron clinical we know we are partnering with a company with the experience and the attention to detail that cti strives to maintain
5289396 in aggregate these new contracts represent both repeat and new client business and cover a wide array of therapeutic areas for multiple small as well as large biopharmaceutical companies
5289397 encorium will provide clinical trial services for these studies on three continents including north america europe and south america
5289398 we should not make it difficult for the gentiles who are turning to god
5289399 is momenteel nog niet beschikbaar maar zal beschikbaar zijn of is momenteel nog niet beschikbaar
5289400 we wanted to find out how british people understood america and found that there was an unbalanced view maybe there are good reasons but if we cleared a lot of that factual ignorance we would have a better understanding of what america really is
5289401 from 1973 to 1990 the united states sold saddam hussein more than a quarter of his weapons
5289402 ideas get around perhaps its that old picture of donald rumsfeld with saddam
5289403 hollywood and all its violence has something to do with it and the awful bush diplomacy
5289404 americans who have not paid their hospitals fees or insurance premiums are not entitled to emergency medical care
5289405 would be obliged to defend poland in case of an attack with greater speed than required under nato of which poland is a member
5289406 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
5289407 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to nuclear attack one hundred percent
5289408 russia would appear to have few options for punishing poland a member of both the eu and nato with a far larger military and economy than georgia but after last week it would be foolish to underestimate what vladimir putin can accomplish with limited military and political resources
5289409 the usa is busy with its own missile defense system
5289410 it does not intend to defend poland at this point poland lays itself open to attack giving the usa a permission to deploy the system the country may become an object of russias reaction such targets are destroyed in the first instance
5289411 it clearly states that we can use nuclear weapons against the countries possessing nuclear weapons against allies of such countries if they somehow support them and against those countries which deploy other countries nuclear weapons on their territories poland is aware of it
5289412 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
5289413 constitutes an important step forward in protecting european nations from a growing threat missile attacks from states like iran
5289414 i was disappointed in russias reaction to the announcement threatening attacks against poland a nato ally is a wholly inappropriate response to an agreement that is not aimed at countering russia rather than exchanging charges over missile defense i would urge moscow to comply with the ceasefire in georgia and immediately begin withdrawing its forces from sovereign georgian territory
5289415 im glad that the thing is finalised now there are so many weapons on the planet that the earth could be destroyed 10 times over its obvious we dont need a new arms race but in the end im in favour of the shield the pros for polish security outweigh the cons its good that the americans will be here
5289416 ready to give both europe and america access to its missile warning systems
5289417 if this went into strike mode right before the dnc it will look like a catastrophe
5289418 the supreme court has recently reaffirmed that you are free to discuss the petitions of candidates on issues and how officials have voted in office without being subject to campaign finance restrictions
5289419 the israeli proposal is unacceptable it is a waste of time the palestinian people will agree to a state with territorial contiguity only in a way that includes jerusalem as its capital
5289420 in the end we are not in an auction a market or a bazaar we will not barter jerusalem for the refugees or the refugees for the security issue or the security for the borders issue all these are our rights it is for their sake that we entered the peace process on the basis of international law of israels withdrawal to the 1967 borders of establishing a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital and solving the final issues including that of the refugees these are the bases on which we entered into the peace process
5289421 the story of our people is your story mahmoud and by our meeting it was made more complete and more beautiful you remain with us mahmoud because you represent everything that unites us
5289422 there is no better or more articulate representation of the prism through which fatah type palestinian nationalism views itself its enemies and the nature of the struggle between them
5289423 you who pass through the sea of transient words take your names and leave steal what you want of the blue of the sea and the sands of memory from you another tank and from us a stone from you another gas bomb and from us the rain take your portion from our blood and just leave because we have in this land what you do not have a motherland
5289424 darwish expressed a fundamental tenet of palestinian nationalism namely the absence of any moral content whatsoever to israels claim to existence palestinian nationalism contains many political perspectives but all tendencies are united in the fundamental article of faith that jewish claims to connection with the land are fictitious fraudulent and lacking in moral or factual basis
5289425 its always going to be the case that there is a wide range of opinions on that difficult issue
5289426 and thats why it was important that sen obama didnt come up with an easy answer
5289427 obama is able to speak very clearly and authentically about his personal christian story
5289428 i think a lot of evangelicals are concerned with climate change theyre concerned with genocide in darfur theyre concerned with our troops in iraq and what were going to do about our energy crisis
5289429 my hunch was the older demographic was for mccain and the younger demographic was far more excited for obama which tracks with my experience in the last five weeks traveling around the country talking to evangelicals the younger you get in that demographic the more receptivity there is for obama
5289430 of course if i believe every child is born for a purpose then obviously i would believe that abortion short circuits a persons purpose
5289431 i dont accept gay marriage i dont think that a gay relationship is exactly what god wants in life but in the hierarchy of evil i would say homosexuality is not the worst sin but i would also say homosexuality is not natural i think that there are certain parts of a body that are made to fit together
5289432 what i worry about is the tyranny of activist judges i do not believe in judges who go out and find all kinds of excuses to thwart the will of the majority
5289433 full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation
5289434 its a challenge to create a simple gui for large group discussions but we are hearing some demand for it from organizations and businesses
5289435 it will take a significant amount of r amp d to make it easy to participate in a seminar with 100 people chatting

5289443 mccain sides with bush on torture again supports veto of anti waterboarding bill
5289444 black claims mccains campaign is above lobbyist influence i dont know what the criticism is
5289445 mccain very honored by support of pastor preaching end time confrontation with iran
5289446 john mccain gets a zero rating for his environmental record
5289447 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail
5289448 some of those who know mccain best republicans are tougher on him than the press is
5289449 he doesnt listen carefully to people and make reasoned judgments
5289450 if john says im going with so and so you cant count on that the next morning
5289451 rumble on the rock 9 in honolulu hawaii circa 2006
5289452 what happened to julia was very unfortunate but i think its a matter for the doctors now
5289453 you know i would never normally ask such a thing but
5289454 we all signed a card for her and sent some flowers this morning to her room
5289455 anything she may have mentioned about any major accidents or surgeries she may have had
5289456 as for the accidents i wouldnt have the slightest idea about that
5289457 ill be taking the rest of the week off i should have plenty of vacation time available
5289458 sure if thats what you want i dont care its up to you
5289459 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
5289460 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying

5289465 obamas mother divorced from obamas father married a man from indonesia named lolo soetoro and the family relocated to the country from 1967 71 at first obama attended the catholic school fransiskus assisis where documents showed he enrolled as a muslim the religion of his stepfather the document required that each student choose one of five state sanctioned religions when registering muslim hindu buddhist catholic or protestant gibbs said he wasnt sure why the document had obama listed as a muslim
5289466 as a six year old in catholic school he studied the catechism

5289468 yo estoy de acuerdo en construir un acuerdo duradero que manteniendo la unidad del partido d certeza a la conducci n del mismo y vayamos posteriormente a una elecci n
5289469 vamos a hacer las acciones que sean necesarias para regresar la legalidad al partido
5289470 siempre y cuando haya un acuerdo de una direcci n que nos lleve a un buen puerto a una direcci n adecuada

5289473 yo estoy muy tranquilo porque kristel llega muy bien en lo f sico en lo t cnico y en lo sicol gico hizo una muy buena marca en 800 metros y eso posibilita que se sienta segura y confiada en su potencial
5289474 no nos ponemos metas en cuanto a un lugar espec fico pero ciertamente que hay un grupo de 10 u 11 competidoras que son muy parejas y entre las cuales la que lleve la mejor t ctica es la que tendr m s chances kristel est en el grupo y puede salir primera o und cima como todas las dem s a m en verdad lo nico que me preocupar ser n los cinco minutos iniciales los primeros 400 metros porque es el momento clave para ponerse en la delantera y por lo tanto pueden haber muchos golpes u otras situaciones inesperadas que pueden restar concentraci n del objetivo central una vez pasado ese tramo inicial creo que las cosas se pueden dar muy bien para nosotros
5289475 kristel es la m s novatas de todas las dem s llevan 20 o 25 carreras de este tipo en el cuerpo y ella apenas seis por lo que claramente hay menos experiencia en cuanto a los aspectos t cticos pero s muy bien que ella llega en un gran momento de su preparaci n
5289476 eine direkte m glichkeit das kilogramm auf eine naturkonstante zur ckzuf hren besteht darin atome zu z hlen denn deren masse ist unver nderlich
5289477 die ptb hat dieses experiment inzwischen eingestellt weil es die erforderliche genauigkeit wahrscheinlich nicht im vorgesehenen zeitraum erreicht h tte

5289483 sowsia has pioneered saas applications in healthcare that will transform the way medical information gets managed online and we are excited to play such a key role in bringing its vision to life
5289484 the significance of opsource on demand is that it supports the latest application technologies so we are not limited by old technology like many traditional players
5289485 in the face of reimbursement and financial pressures healthcare organizations are eager to embrace a redesign that will remove costs and expand quality today
5289486 sowsia s comprehensive offering launches healthcare into a state of evolution overdrive

5289490 he doesnt really like to let go of boxed up old things and i have more clothes than i could ever hope to wear
5289491 its a slightly tenuous cease fire at the moment we just try our best to keep the open areas clean and clutter free

5289497 its about girls seeing celebrities on tv shows movie and concert tours and now they get to communicate about clothing on social networking sites more communicating tools are available to spread the word about fashion a celebrity is wearing that drives tween fashion
5289498 a lot of the very fashionable looks right now are very modest
5289499 its almost a flashback to looking very demure and proper

5289503 at age 61 i wrote my first book and today at age 63 im busier than ever with my career and family
5289504 it is likely that in the very near future corporate hr departments will have to learn how to work with distributed teams composed of such consultants
5289505 in afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the islamic rules say that it is
5289506 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations
5289507 when i first came to jail i cried so much blood was coming out of my mouth my husbands brother told me he would give my children back when i came out of jail but he has become a talib nobody comes to see us in jail there are a lot of diseases
5289508 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me
5289509 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions
5289510 they are very aware of the inequality in the system
5289511 the most refreshing thing is that there are plans coming from the department of womens affairs it is not just us pushing our ideas on to them
5289512 please please take our words somewhere where people will be kind and help us

5289669 this one was a little more challenging than the first win
5289670 the car isnt running so good i tried to run the bottom and followed some guys around but i knew i couldnt get by that way so i drove it in as deep as i could up top and it worked out
5289671 i saw bradys number on the board on that last caution and knew he was going to be tough
5289672 i think this gave us enough points to wrap up the title
5289673 it was very exciting and it was as hard as i thought it was going to be
5289674 i had a four shot lead coming down the 18th and that made it a bit easier
5289675 it was a tough day it got windy after the greens got really firm i didnt hit it great just managed to get it in the hole
5289676 i knew the back nine was going to be tough
5289677 i knew that if i could shoot somewhere around par that was going to be close
5289678 my ball kind of dug in the bunker on 12 the third shot came out perfect and a little bit of luck at the end as the ball rolled into the cup
5289679 maybe i used up all my good shots on the front nine
5289680 i felt like i was hitting the shots i had to hit but i just wasnt getting it close enough to make the putts and put a little bit more pressure on brendon
5289681 its never nice to finish with three bogeys in the last six holes but thats golf its obviously very disappointing right now to finish the way i did and almost hand him the tournament but it doesnt matter its another week and its all good

5289683 for me im just trying to put a bit more distance between myself and second on the money list
5289684 brendon is too good a player to be hanging around here the same as me

5289689 urological cancers affect both men and women but my main drive is to tackle mens attitudes and increase their knowledge offshore is an ideal environment to do so as it is largely a male dominated workforce
5289690 as well as explaining the background to ucan and the work we are doing this was a great chance to educate the crew on how to spot the symptoms which could help to increase the number of early diagnoses and reduce the number of fatal cases each year
5289691 around 18 000 people die of urological cancers in the uk every year and this figure is rising so awareness is really important and im very grateful to talisman for hosting my visit
5289692 is far from business as usual the soap opera is seeking an iraq war veteran to play an injured veteran
5289693 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5289694 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5289695 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5289696 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves

5289875 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
5289876 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out
5289877 and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5289878 last week we announced that we had information about yulia tymoshenkos systematic work in the interests of russia unfortunately that information is now confirmed
5289879 we will hand over the material we have to the law enforcement bodies for detailed study
5289880 that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1
5289881 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship
5289882 there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary
5289883 but valencia is a new race and we must start again
5289884 i am expecting a competitive weekend as well because at the moment we are looking quite strong
5289885 scoring more points is our target and if we challenge for the podium again that would be great
5289886 we are genuinely challenging to be the third quickest car based on the last few races
5289887 valencia will also show how well teams can react to new conditions so it will be an interesting weekend and we have every reason to be feeling very positive
5289888 the track looks amazing and the location is fantastic so i am really looking forward to this grand prix
5289889 i enjoy going to new venues because they are a new challenge and there is always something to discover every race is unique and i like that
5289890 i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learned to adapt quickly
5289891 it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show

5289960 it ought to be a matter of concern that the body that will be carrying out some of the key tasks previously handled by energywatch appears to be less effective in securing compensation for energy customers
5289961 we cannot hold the customers hand through the process as energywatch can we have to wait until the customer has first exhausted an energy companys own complaints procedure secondly we calculate compensation awarded to consumers in a different way from energywatch
5289962 consumer focus simply wont replace the services that energywatch currently provides
5289963 whereas energywatch deals with any complaint referred to it consumer focus is required to deal only with complaints about imminent disconnections we are worried that this will have a knock on effect for local information and advice services such as age concern many of which are already experiencing both rising demand from pensioners with financial worries and problems with obtaining funding for service provision this is very worrying at a time when energy price rises are having a significant impact on older people and other vulnerable groups
5289964 in the future consumers will not have the voice that they had when they benefited from a watchdog that was devoted exclusively to concerns about energy
5289965 whats more if the remit of the new body taking over from energywatch can deal only with consumers who are regarded as vulnerable then it will be of no use to mr and mrs average this is of particular concern when rising energy prices mean that more and more people are going to be struggling with their energy bills and might need the help of a body like energywatch
5289966 the organisation will be more of a campaigning body and is not primarily going to be there to help consumers with their complaints
5289967 it will be able to offer some help with complaints but this is going to be limited to those customers who are deemed to be vulnerable either because of their personal circumstances or because they have been disconnected or threatened with disconnection
5289968 we expect that we will receive about 15 000 to 20 000 calls a year relating to energy complaints which is a lot fewer than energywatch currently receives the government is putting a much greater focus on energy companies resolving complaints themselves through a much tighter procedure
5289969 the new standards for complaints handling that are being introduced on october 1 will require much more detailed and transparent record keeping
5289970 on the same date the ombudsman scheme will become compulsory rather than voluntary as at present so it will have much sharper teeth
5289971 i cannot believe that the government would be so foolish as to disband an organisation that has given so much help to so many people
5289972 energywatch was tremendously helpful to me when i got into a dispute with three different energy companies over my fuel bills i ended up being chased for money by british gas e on and npower at one point i had bailiffs turn up at my door demanding money that i did not owe
5289973 fortunately energywatch staff have devoted a lot of time and effort into fighting my case and i am now in the process of claiming back money from the three energy companies as well as compensation for all the distress and inconvenience they have caused me
