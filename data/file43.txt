430079 ja en dan gaat ze de hele wereld redden en leeft iedereen nog lang en gelukkig nou dan staat de titel voor het verhaal al vast clich
430080 er was eens een schrijver nou ja zo zou je het haast niet kunnen noemen het was meer een uitwisser al jarenlang probeerde hij een boek te schrijven en na al die jaren had hij nog geen letter op papier gekregen maar dat was logisch aangezien hij altijd op de computer schreef dit is het verhaal over hem zijn inspiratie en wat daaruit voorkomt
430081 oh sorry het is natuurlijk een vierkwarts maat ichi ni san shi
430082 mens ze bedoelt dat je allang had moeten gaan zingen
430083 altijd moeten zij op de voorgrond ik ben hier degene die beroemd hoort te worden ha ik snap ze wel zij zijn gewoon te slecht als ik zou gaan zingen vallen ze helemaal in het niet maar toch is het gemeen second vocals tsss ik ben hier degene die dat ene dinges waardoor je goed bent heeft het leven is zo oneerlijk de slechten krijgen al het goede ofzo ach wat kan het mij nou schelen het gaat erom dat k weet dat ik kan zingen al zou het mooi zijn dat anderen dat ook wisten dan h d ik er in ieder geval nog wat aan tss second vocals belachelijk
430084 diony dit heeft wel wat als achtergrondzang maar ik denk eigenlijk dat je eerder jezelf belachelijk aan het maken bent
430085 appelmoes sorry mensen ik weet dat het niet relevant is maar ik bleek hier iets te moeten zeggen en niemand heeft gezegd dat het zinnig moest zijn
430086 eigenlijk is het gemeen dat ik nu zorg dat ik een gave gitaarsolo verpest maar het publiek wil mij nee dat heb ik niet zelf bedacht het is serieus net aan me verteld en even onder ons ik logeer vanavond in het prillon hotel niet dat dat er toe doet
430087 uhu en ik was niet van plan ze daarmee valse hoop te geven
430088 kom op jongens het is bijna 12 uur we moeten nog maar een uurtje of zo ga nu geen ruzie maken
430089 anne sommige dingen kun je gewoon niet maken ook gij niet uwe hoogheid
430090 ik weet in ieder geval dat je maar n jongen gelijk kan hebben
430091 tss jij arrogante bitch ik kan ook wel gaan beloven dat we zo meteen door het podium zakken maar dat komt ook nooit uit
430092 and if id knwo who i was i would stay myself
430093 mens ik bedoel laat ook maar normaal erger ik me aan dat gegil maar in deze omstandigheden
430094 ja is het niet vreselijk ik moet over twee weken 16 uur 24 minuten en 13 seconden bij de tandarts zijn
430095 oh ik dacht al dat je gilde omdat we opeens van het podium naar een of andere woestijn zijn geflitst
430096 hoe kunnen jullie zo zorgeloos en onzinnig praten terwijl we eh hier zijn we gaan dood n mijn nagels gaan kapot door die hitte
430097 ik heb werkelijk geen idee misschien is dat het beste in deze omstandigheden
430098 aangezien we nu toch niet meer stil zijn en er niks is gebeurt kunnen we misschien bedenken wat we hier in h melsnaam doen
430099 we dromen het concert was waarschijnlijk heel vermoeiend wel jammer dat ik altijd wakker word als ik besef dat ik droom het had best gezellig kunnen worden
430100 en nu maar hopen dat dit een droom is anders heb ik morgen nog koppijn
430101 gast ben je alleen uitgevonden om de hoofden van alle meisjes en als ik een jongen was zou ik het ook wel weten op hol te laten slaan of kom je ons ook nog eens helpen
430102 jullie zijn in naamloos een wereld aan de binnenkant van de aarde de idee n dat hier zand en steen en vuur en wat de aardlingen ook zeggen inzit zijn door ons volk in hun hoofd geplaatst
430103 dit is echt ziek ze kunnen hun eigen mening niet eens vormen kom maar mee larry ik zal wel naar je luisteren en niet zo triest doen
430104 ach ik praat het liefst tegen jullie allemaal ik vind jullie niet triest hoor
430105 meiden als we allemaal even stil zijn kunnen we horen hoe we weer terug komen en waar we echt zijn dan bestaat er misschien een kans dat ik mijn afspraak met de tandarts niet mis al loopt mijn schema nu natuurlijk helemaal in de war
430106 is dat net zoiets als mes en vork voor bij het eten
430107 ik leg het nog wel eens uit denk ik eh
430108 ok dan zal ik eerst uitleggen wat jullie hier doen ten eerste spijt het ons heel erg
430109 gast als er meer van jullie zijn maakt dat helemaal niks uit
430110 het maakt w l uit maar we konden niet anders onze wereld gaat er bijna aan de hoogste hogere raad der hogere volken uit het hogere land die verassend genoeg alleen maar uit dwergen bestaat wil er niets aan doen en aangezien zij de leiders zijn was onze wereld gedoemd te vergaan totdat mijn verzetsgroep de naamlozige naamlozigheid die zeker niet zinloos is iets bedacht om het tegen te gaan
430111 ingewikkeld leventje zie je wel dat ladymkedy helemaal niet zon irritante naam is
430112 goh dit begint wel erg op een clich fantasy verhaal te lijken
430113 het spijt me maar wat heb je aan het leven als het niet in gevaar is
430114 eh goed nee niet goed onze wereld is in gevaar
430115 het zit zo de hoogste hogere raad der hogere volken uit het hogere land die verassend genoeg alleen maar uit dwergen bestaat wil de hele aarde inclusief naamloos laten ontploffen dat is dan wel niet zo erg maar ik denk dat de aardlingen het niet kunnen accepteren
430116 ben ik dan de enige die wil weten wat er hier aan de hand is
430117 je hebt gelijk ik zal het even duidelijk uitleggen de hoogste hogere raad der hogere volken uit het hogere land die verassend genoeg alleen maar uit dwergen bestaat zijn de leiders van onze wereld ze zorgen met bepaalde vormen van magie dat het goed gaat en dat hij beschermd is maar helaas denken ze dat een wereld beter wordt als je de bewoners meer regels geeft per dag overtreedt zelfs de slimste en verstandigste bewoner van naamloos wel een stuk of tien regels en er staan zware boetes op overtredingen
430118 in ieder geval nou naamloos is dus niet meer zon vredige planeet als hij altijd was en dat komt juist doordat de hogere raad hem vredig wil maken alleen willen die arrogante dwergen niet toegeven dat het hun eigen schuld is dus geven ze de schuld maar aan het onbekende de aardbewoners
430119 niet echt ze denken dat jullie het leven hier verzieken met jullie kernafval en van die lawaaimakende rookdingen jullie zouden alleen maar slechte eigenschappen bezitten ik snap er eerlijk gezegd niet veel van maar aangezien de aarde niet meer in harmonie is met de binnenkant mag hij niet meer voortbestaan
430120 ok de aarde gaat ontploffen en in onze laatste uren haal je ons naar de binnenkant van de aarde om dat te vertellen zodat we ook nog eens in een onnatuurlijke omgeving moeten ontploffen
430121 nee gast als we je niet geloven is dit allemaal niet waar zijn wij hier niet en is er dus niks aan de hand ik denk dat ik voor die optie ga
430122 alleen als jullie bewijzen dat jullie alle goede eigenschappen bezitten kunnen jullie uit deze wereld komen
430123 nee zoveel tijd hebben we niet mag ik het alsjeblieft even uitleggen
430124 vroeger laten we zeggen een paar eeuwen geleden bezat iedereen in naamloos alle goede eigenschappen maar sinds de hogere raad de leiding heeft komen er steeds meer slechte eigenschappen bij vandaar dat bijna niemand deze wereld meer in of uit kan komen het zou dus heel speciaal zijn als dat de aardlingen wel lukte we weten wel bijna zeker dat de raad dan overtuigd is van jullie onschuld
430125 goh nooit gedacht dat ik het ooit met jou eens zou zijn
430126 ho rustig blijven we hebben wel belangrijkere dingen aan ons hoofd
430127 ach larry is toch van mij het is tenslotte m jn droom
430128 mens als dit een droom is is hij van mij ik ben toch zeker zelf aan het denken
430129 ik zei net toch dat we geen ruzie gingen maken dit is nou eenmaal geen droom
430130 jij ziet het goed in nu veel succes op jullie zoektocht naar de uitgang ik hoop dat jullie een wijze les mogen leren en als jullie in nood zijn kan ik nog wel een keer op komen duiken
430131 een n dkreet het enig normale wezen wat hier rondliep is verdwenen
430132 oh ja een t knappe elf die het heeft over een naamloze wereld aan de binnenkant van de aarde waar dwergen over denken hem samen met de aarde zelf op te blazen is v l normaler dan ons
430133 anne en diony al jarenlang wordt iedereen gek van jullie geruzie maar het was nog wel te verdragen maar zouden jullie als je blieft heel even kunnen doen alsof jullie elkaar een klein beetje aardig vinden terwijl we een uitweg zoeken uit de binnenkant van de aarde
430134 hihi jullie zijn lekker g l en jullie stuiteren lekker puh
430135 nee ze bedoelt dat je tamelijk gek aan het doen was een klap in het gezicht is dan het enige wat helpt
430136 en we weten nog steeds niet waar we zijn en wat we moeten doen
430137 het lijkt me handig als we gewoon naar de uitgang zoeken ik moet nog z veel doen
430138 het enige wat ik me nu nog kan bedenken is dat die gast gelijk heeft die enge balletjes lijken namelijk wel er echt
430139 heeft iemand de deur of wat dan ook gezien waardoor we binnenkwamen
430140 ok laten we een schema opstellen ik heb altijd pen en papier bij me
430141 het spelen ging wel publiek ging uit zijn dak anne flirte met jongens en diony maakte ruzie oftewel niets bijzonders
430142 ok laten we allemaal nog even goed nadenken is er echt niet iets speciaals gebeurd
430143 ik was aan het zingen en opeens waren we daar
430144 angst ik was z bang toen we daar opeens waren
430145 natuurlijk maar ik bedoelde het meer in de letterlijke zin iets als een schok ofzo
430146 die larry zei toch dat we aan de binnenkant van de aarde zaten en dat er helemaal geen steen of zo zat zoals ze op de aarde zeggen dat moet betekenen dat de aarde hier vlak onder het zand zit
430147 maar hoe komen we onder het zand we kunnen niet graven
430148 great komt er eens iemand op een goed idee kunnen we het niet uitvoeren
430149 zou het zo zijn dat alles at je wenst uitkomt
430150 haha het werkt waarschijnlijk niet bij mensen als jij had k maar een graafmachine
430151 tja wie het kleine niet eert is het grote niet weert
430152 natuurlijk had ook ik liever een graafmachine gehad maar het is nou eenmaal zo
430153 oh jee het is en hand graafmachine weet iemand hoe je zon ding bestuurd
430154 dit is z slecht voor mijn huid maargoed laat mij maar ik weet er wel wat van
430155 ik snap het echt niet hebben ze hier een of ander iets uitgevonden waardoor graafmachines niet werken
430156 great hier graven we ons dus nooit uit we zullen deze wereld herstel woestijn dus serieus in moeten waarom krijgen leuke jongens altijd gelijk
430157 realiseert niemand zich dan dat we een heel groot probleem hebben
430158 hee hij staat stil maar het is dus waarschijnlijk zon 2 uur s nachts
430159 hoofdstuk 3 paragraaf 2 8 dingen met een andere aandrijvingkracht dan die van mensen of dieren zullen nooit werken dit is iets voor de slechte aardlingen waar wij niets maar dan ook niets mee te maken moeten hebben
430160 ik dacht al dat ze geen wet tegen discriminatie zouden hebben zo te zien zijn we niet erg geliefd
430161 het draait niet altijd om jouw liefdesleven anne het lijkt me handiger om iets te vinden wat over slaapplaatsen gaat
430162 volgens deze wet heeft ieder volk een eigen groep met balletjes en krijgt ieder lid van het volk er n ik geloof serieus dat we zojuist tot volk gebombardeerd zijn
430163 en deze dingen kunnen van vorm veranderen als je ze aanraakt en ergens aan denkt in alles behalve iets met eigen hersens of een energiebron meer staat er niet

430176 we would not consider that any of these cases have been thoroughly tested yet based on the extremely limited information we have seen
430177 we feel at this moment it is really too early to say if both of these cases are negative
430178 china and japan are close to each other but have a distant relationship
430179 people hold parties at home and invite their friends and neighbors in china or the united states i came to japan nine years ago but i have seldom been invited to friends homes
430180 the relationship between japan and china will become closer in the future
430181 and id like to act as a bridge between the two countries
430182 we dont know what will happen to this market in the future but we know that our development will depend on what happens here to a large extent
430183 its difficult to make japanese even your own brothers and sisters understand that japans development depends on china and chinas development depends on japan they are under the influence of the media back home which is always blasting away at china
430184 initially i thought i should go to china and try things out and if things didnt work here i could always go home
430185 but here i discovered if you have a bit of money you can do just about anything in japan you dont have that feeling there is a sense of so many rules
430186 in the last few years things have grown black and white between us
430187 on the political and diplomatic side things are pessimistic but on the economic side the relationship is growing stronger and stronger
430188 it is meaningless to think japanese companies would withdraw and go somewhere else like
430189 history problems are history problems but i think you have to be realistic
430190 i am no fortuneteller but from my observations we have reason to believe that the fifth round of talks will be held on schedule and will lead to results

430216 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
430217 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
430218 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
430219 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
430220 in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
430221 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic

430264 since hitting a peak in the summer of 2007 the illegal population may have declined by 11 percent through may of 2008
430265 it seems that increased enforcement is at least partly responsible for this decline
430266 the census bureau does not produce estimates or counts of illegal immigrants living in the united states
430267 the persuasiveness of cis argument is undermined not only by an absence of hard data but by the faulty logic and contradictory statements of the report itself
430268 the authors report confidently about a population that is nearly impossible to accurately measure
430269 undocumented migration clearly responds to changing u s economic conditions with steep increases in the flow toward the end of expansion phases of the business cycle and significant decreases during economic downturns
430270 there is no evidence of an exodus either because of economic conditions or greater enforcement
430271 several demographers who specialize in estimating the illegal immigrant population expressed concern about the limits of the studys methodology but said they found the possibility that the illegal immigrant population is decreasing plausible determining the actual amount of that decline however is a far more controversial matter
430272 that does not support the argument that people are leaving but rather that people here are spending less money because of economic conditions and future plans
430273 while it is clear that a large share of illegal aliens are included in census bureau surveys there is always the question of those who are missed although dhs as well as most researchers assume a 10 percent undercount there is debate about the number of illegal immigrants who are not counted
430274 the center for immigration studies cis has a history of misrepresenting facts concerning immigrants and latinos
430275 stephen buckner a spokesman for the us census responded to this report by saying
430276 whether its their relationship with zimbabwe or north korea or myanmar sudan the chinese are either supplying economic dollars and activities to those regimes or blocking for them or slowing things down in international bodies from stopping the abuses

430350 slowly but surely i have been soaking rilke up these last few months the man his work and his life and that is probably the only right way with literature with study with people or with anything else to let it all soak in to let it all mature slowly inside you until it has become a part of yourself that too is a growing process everything is a growing process and in between emotions and sensations that strike you like lightning but still the most important thing is the organic process of growing
430351 and so i can sit for hours and know everything and bear everything and grow stronger in the bearing of it and at the same time feel sure that life is beautiful and worth living and meaningful despite everything but that does not mean i am always filled with joy and exaltation i am often dog tired after standing about in queues but i know that this too is part of life and somewhere there is something inside me that will never desert me again

430358 when she started grapevine she was the only person outside the news organizations who could provide what she was providing that kind of reporting

430435 let their opinions form freely and honor that their beliefs are truly limiting thoughts about themselves in the end
430436 then become like a hollow flute and let their beliefs positive or negative flow right through you

430440 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire
430441 for people born in the year of the horse it is recommended that they wear a pendant of an ox which will help to attract away the rat so as to minimise the influence of the clash
430442 the traditional belief is that you need an animal to attract away the rat
430443 according to the calendar it is an auspicious day there is nothing wrong with choosing this date it still represents a positive energy
430444 if you pick a good day this indicates a smooth beginning to the marriage

430448 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
430449 the home depot is currently not moving forward with its plans to build at the proposed long beach site
430450 we look forward to working with local officials and the community in providing a successful project on the site that the majority of long beach residents agree needs to be improved
430451 address the additional information required by the court in order to be consistent with the courts ruling
430452 because the site has significant amounts of dirt remaining in its original unvegetated state from when the site was salt marsh wetlands the citys failure to conduct a proper wetlands delineation study was erroneous
430453 wide variety of wildlife on the project site including butterflies mammals including rabbits squirrels and raccoons amphibians including the pacific tree frog reptiles and birds including numerous birds associated with wetlands such as osprey the snowy egret and great blue and black crowned herons and gulls
430454 i believe theres more dirt than the city is letting on

430456 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
430457 voted for tax hikes that would have impacted those taking home just 32 000 a year
430458 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
430459 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
430460 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
430461 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
430462 we agreed that there were certain issues that were not going to allow us to get the necessary votes to get to 60 votes
430463 we believe that its critically important that any plan be balanced that it include serious conservation measures as well as additional production incentives
430464 this is exxons drilling agenda wrapped in a veneer of other energy policies
430465 i am hopeful this plan can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor
430466 in the last two games we have created several chances but either the opposition keeper has played really well to stop us from scoring or we have just missed the target
430467 there is no problem i am sure the goals will come and the important thing is that the players are creating chances
430468 when they have more sharpness they will score more goals at this stage it is all about preparing for the start of the season and i know that when the season begins my players will be ready
430469 last season fernando torres steven gerrard ryan babel dirk kuyt yossi benayoun and peter crouch all got double figures for us so i know we have the players to score goals

430691 de terugtrekking er gekomen is ten gevolge van een controle die door de producent zelf werd gevraagd en niet door het federaal voedselagentschap dat verantwoordelijk is voor onze voedselveiligheid
430692 vandaag geen enkele informatie terzake te vinden is op de internetsite van het voedselagentschap
430693 in die zin dat wij enkele weken geleden het federaal voedselagentschap terzake interpelleerden toen werd geantwoord dat alle controles voorzien waren

430714 the biggest surprise for me in this whole thing has been that the lord would use somebody as broken as i am to do as much as hes done
430715 we had no money no resources and no core group small group or bible study
430716 so we decided to start networking among non believers and believers without a church home we went to rotary meetings and joined the chamber of commerce to let people know who we were and what we were doing
430717 this area has been burnt over pretty bad by fundamentalism
430718 a lot of people thought theyd tasted the gospel before but what theyd really tasted was religion
430719 that group slowly started falling in love with each other
430720 sometimes you have to be intentional to find common areas in suburbia

430733 while i personally own both next gen consoles it appears that the demo will only work on the blu ray capable sony ps3
430734 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
430735 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
430736 penalizing ivins might discourage other employees from voluntarily reporting accidental spills of hot agents
430737 if you could reduce these sensational attacks further i think you are almost approaching a level of normal or latent violence
430738 later this year general petraeus will present me with recommendations on future troop levels including further reductions in our combat forces as conditions permit
430739 thanks to the success of the surge these forces are becoming available
430740 one of our goals is to stabilise afghanistan so it can become a conduit and a hub between south and central asia so that energy can flow to the south and so that the countries of central asia are no longer bottled up between two enormous powers of china and russia but rather they have outlets to the south as well as to the north and the east and the west

430743 those who dont qualify include many part time workers people who quit or were fired and workers who didnt earn enough money in a one year base period that often excludes the most recent three to six months worker advocates say the new deal era system hasnt been updated enough to reflect an age of more frequent job changes more part time work and falling union membership
430744 if the situation happened to worsen other dispositions could intervene in particular concerning small vehicles and the level of production at the flins factory

430749 usually its when youre making a loss that you tell the unions that there are difficulties and we anticipate big problems right now theyre making big profits and so this is difficult very difficult for us to hear
430750 it is not a decision to close down the party but it is a serious warning
430751 unfortunately one must fear that the judges will interpret their verdict in a manner whereby the akp should refrain from interfering with the traditional autocratic framework of the republic or to put it another way the party should accommodate itself to the old system as did many other parties which were also eager to implement reforms
430752 odds to find a way out are stronger than a month ago
430753 eleven members of the constitutional court will engage in long discussions on whether or not the akp has turned into a focal point for anti secular activities at the end the tendency in favor of a ban will dominate numerically and the decision will be put to a vote the result of the vote will be six to five in favor of a ban but of course a total of seven votes is necessary for a ban and as a result the akp will not be closed down however the party will be made to suffer a serious loss of image and prestige its record will be damaged in the eyes of society and public opinion henceforth the ruling party will be forced to act more cautiously to regain the trust of the sectors that are sensitive to secularism and to repair its image
430754 mr erdogans government should also turn more of its attention to the economy the akps record on the economy is strong but that has been due in part to a benign world economic situation times are more difficult now and turkey with a gaping current account deficit and rising inflation is again looking vulnerable more liberalization would help keep the economy on an even keel
430755 during his tenure as jerusalem mayor and trade and industry minister olmert would seek duplicate funding for his trips abroad from public bodies including from the state with each of them requested to fund the same trip
430756 but now he doesnt have to worry about consolidating his power as prime minister he has a clear interest to do it the mandate to do it and nothing to lose
430757 success would still depend on the willingness of labour and kadima allies to stand by him and effectively enable him to leave a legacy that might make israelis and palestinians forgive the rest but by this analysis palestinian and syrian partners on these parallel peace tracks should race with olmert to get final status agreements on paper in the few remaining weeks of his premiership its a small rickety and bullet ridden window but in a few months it might well be replaced by an impenetrable concrete wall
430758 enough is enough finally these boys have come together to demonstrate that companies are getting big money but we get nothing
430759 committed to fight against those extremists and terrorists who are destroying and making the world not safe
430760 it was a very pointed message saying look we know theres a connection not just with haqqani but also other bad guys and the isi and we think you could do more and we want you to do more about it
430761 he haqqani was in frequent contact with bin laden and with the isis brigadiers for their part pakistani intelligence and the cia came to rely on haqqani for testing and experimentation with new weapons systems and tactics haqqani was so favored with supplies that he was in a position to broker them and to help equip the arab volunteers gathering in his region the cia officers working from islamabad regarded him as a proven commander who could put a lot of men under arms at short notice haqqani had the cias full support
430762 what kind of mother turns down a letter from home and accepts a trip to hawaii
430763 while it continued to progress its inquiries it did not have information to indicate dr haneef had any involvement in or foreknowledge of the uk terror acts
430764 to indicate that dr haneef was undertaking planning for a terrorist attack in australia or overseas
430765 did not have sufficient grounds to issue an adverse security assessment
430766 expressed a clear view that they did not believe that all relevant elements of the proposed charge could be proven at that time
430767 i was as surprised as anyone when the dpp advised that haneef could be charged because i didnt think the evidence was strong enough
430768 the inquiry will have to resolve the conundrum as to how dr haneef was charged when the agency which charged him the afp and the agency which provided it with legal advice the dpp both thought there was insufficient evidence
430769 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
430770 we are not sure whether the negative emotions expressed by viewers were related to their feelings about either candidate or about the way in which the message was delivered
430771 however we do know that the ad did not move voters and they expressed negative emotions after viewing the ad
430772 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
430773 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
430774 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
430775 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided
430776 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
430777 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
430778 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
430779 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
430780 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
430781 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
430782 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
430783 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
430784 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
430785 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
430786 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
430787 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
430788 the increase in real consumer spending was quite minimal despite the massive fiscal stimulus
430789 i think the ultimate solution is a nationalization of both fannie and freddie
430790 the change in working hours is the canary in the coal mine
430791 we should have warned the authorities as soon as 4 45 a m
430792 this analysis must not stop at the nuclear plants but must be widened to all nuclear sites to processing sites such as cadarache marcoule or the hague to disused uranium mines such as bessines to military sites such as valduc and to waste stocking centres notably in the manche region and at soulaines
430793 the repetition of incidents indicates a particularly worrying lack of any safety culture
430794 4 000 u s deaths and a handful of images
430795 even memorial services for killed soldiers once routinely open are increasingly off limits detainees were widely photographed in the early years of the war but the department of defense citing prisoners rights has recently stopped that practice as well
430796 while embed restrictions do permit photographs of dead soldiers to be published once family members have been notified
430797 in practice the military has exacted retribution on the rare occasions that such images have appeared
430798 if the conflict in vietnam was notable for open access given to journalists too much many critics said as the war played out nightly in bloody newscasts the iraq war may mark an opposite extreme after five years and more than 4 000 american combat deaths searches and interviews turned up fewer than a half dozen graphic photographs of dead american soldiers
430799 the photographer was immediately kicked out of his or her embed following publication of such photos
430800 stop photographing delete his memory cards and surrender his cameras
430801 high ranking marine public affairs officers demanded that mr miller remove the photos when he refused his embed was terminated
430802 would not allow even the pants or shoes of an injured or killed marine to be depicted in images
430803 specifically mr miller provided our enemy with an after action report on the effectiveness of their attack and on the response procedures of u s and iraqi forces
430804 mr millers complete lack of respect to these marines their friends and families is shameful how do we explain to their children or families these disturbing pictures just days after it happened
430805 the fact that the images i took of the suicide bombing which are just photographs of something that happens every day all across the country the fact that these photos have been so incredibly shocking to people says that whatever they are doing to limit this type of photo getting out it is working
430806 i took pictures of something they didnt like and they removed me deciding what i can and cannot document i dont see a clearer definition of censorship
430807 they embedded a war photographer and when i took a photo of war they disembedded me its as if its okay to take pictures of them handing lollipops to kids on the street and providing medical care but photographing the actual war is unacceptable
430808 argos distribution workers helped to save over 10 million for the group in the last fourteen months alone they have cooperated fully by accepting changes to working practices including significant increases in flexible working these savings alone will fund the total cost of the very reasonable increases we are seeking several times over this is a hugely profitable company and all our members are asking for is a fair share of the wealth theyve worked so hard to create
430809 we live in a remote area and the children have to take the school bus every day this alone costs me le 150 a month on top of that i have to pay for their private tuition how do i make ends meet
430810 we had feared that the events of april 6 in mahalla when over 600 people were detained and there was a violent crackdown on those involved in the uprising would have the effect of frightening workers
430811 they are prepared to take other measures to get their wages and rights
430812 if our pension fund is not refunded we will not start teaching when the semester begins
430813 a few kilometres further east the affected siemens workers trotted home after finishing their shift while in the salon krefeld the personnel executive committee chairman siegfried russwarm stood harmoniously alongside works council boss ralf heckmann and contently concluded we are united in principle with the employees side on the issue of guaranteeing siemens future
430814 if i am being absolutely honest i hope the snp would win rather than labour if we are honest we are fighting for third place
430815 were not going to win the election we want to take third but if you put me on the spot and say who would you rather win i would rather gordon brown got a political kicking
430816 solidarity will continue to welcome positive reforms from the snp and say why and when we dont think they go far enough we will criticise the snp when they put the interest of business and the wealthy before the interests of the majority of society and we will point out consistently that it is the left leaning measures of the snp that have so far also proved the most popular
430817 the snp is now the party of protest snp is to the left of labour so is glasgow east
430818 highlighted bad social conditions in glasgow the same conditions hold in london liverpool sheffield newcastle and hartlepool a unified struggle by working class in britain against poverty inequality the consequences of war in iraq the attack on democratic rights and all the policies of the social elite for whom labour and the tories speak is needed in what sense does your proposal of scottish independence advance this
430819 has recently expanded to incorporate 10 new nations with a lower population than scotland scotland has the economic strength to survive
430820 i dont feel british or part of british imperialism labour is a british party
430821 this is a historic victory in glasgow east for the snp and i congratulate john mason let us be clear it is a victory for a left of centre party which carries on glasgows radical tradition
430822 there was not widespread overt explicit talk on the streets of this being a vote on independence
430823 it clearly is a clash of contrasting opinions on the westminster labour government compared to the holyrood snp government and is a massive impetus towards independence
430824 it is no use beating around the bush this meeting has collapsed members have not been able to bridge their differences
430825 the vulnerability of poor farmers cannot be traded off against the commercial interests of developed countries
430826 the proposal would have put the livelihoods of vulnerable farmers of the developing world in danger due to cheap farm imports from the rich world
430827 this selfish and short sighted behavior directly caused the failure of this small scale wto ministerial meeting which will lead to a series of serious consequences
430828 on the side of the developed countries there was very little willingness to provide concessions on commercial matters but plenty of ambition to obtain benefits for themselves
430829 it is unconscionable that we could have come out with an outcome that rolled the global trading system back not by one year or 5 years but by 30 years
430830 this comes down to how much countries could raise their barriers to imports of food
430831 goebbels used to say if you repeat a lie several times it becomes a truth
430832 one of the most reactionary farm bills in the history of the us
430833 it is bad enough to be facing defeat in the last mile of such a marathon
430834 its worse to realize that some of the people across the table instead of working for success are in reality preparing for failure
430835 it is a massive blow to confidence in the global economy
430836 the confidence shot in the arm that we needed badly will not now happen
430837 in the long term the debacle in geneva marks a break of immense importance the rules governing trade will become more inscrutable because agreements between individual states will replace the framework that had been globally accepted up to now the wto will lose its influence as the referee in disputes the price will only gradually be perceived by businesses but it will be high the trade system is losing the dependability that exporters urgently require
430838 gone are the days when the us and europe could set the tone and largely draw up the world trade agreements amongst themselves china and india took a tough stance they fight hard for their interests and only support free trade when it suits them the old industrial powers will slowly realize the bitter truth of this geneva was just a foretaste
430839 to the litany of recent sour economic news add this unhappy bulletin from geneva the global trade negotiations known as the doha round broke up yesterday without an agreement
430840 proved themselves unready for such a deal for the foreseeable future this result casts a long shadow over the wtos future relevance and increases the likelihood that global trade will splinter into competing regional or sectoral blocs

430843 they say that time changes things but you actually have to change them yourself
430844 nobody in the history of the world has ever even conceived of making this much less actually made it
430845 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying
430846 a clear signal for a mutual freeze we would freeze our sanctions efforts and iran the development of its centrifuges this is a clear offer that deserves a clear answer and soon
430847 we would then have to further increase pressure via sanctions
430848 inflation rate to drop to 2 in european zone by end of 2009
430849 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
430850 we are determined to continue the raid until we arrest all those involved

430856 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
430857 he did not seem to have any particular grudges or idiosyncrasies
430858 he was the last person you would have suspected to be involved in something like this
430859 when he feels that he has been slighted and especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
430860 either in a big hurry or didnt know what they were doing
430861 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
430862 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
430863 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
430864 there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to iraq

430934 lo nico que se conoce del conjunto de instrumentos son los t tulos y dudo de que todos ellos estuvieran realmente culminados lo que hoy podemos revisar es que se aprobaron los t tulos de las leyes los nombres no tenemos ni siquiera el contenido con lo cual quiz ni siquiera est n listas y ser despu s cuando en los pr ximos d as terminar n de elaborarlas para publicarlas
430935 l aprovech el lapso que ten a y frente a la inminencia de su culminaci n hizo lo que estuvo a su alcance para publicar unos t tulos de leyes que representan un golpe de estado a la constituci n
430936 el decreto al crear rganos y articular los procedimientos que deben materializar la justicia laboral administrativa no regula de forma directa el ejercicio derecho deber constitucional al trabajo sino que refuerza o protege un aspecto tangencial del derecho consagrado en el ar t culo 87 de la constituci n en tanto desarrolla aspectos procedimentales y t cnicos supeditados a los principios y reglas que rigen en materia laboral

430945 the major threat to indian sovereignty is government policies that are based on pseudo secularism and muslim appeasement
430946 i came to know the gravity of the islamic threat what the whole world is facing and the ignorance people have about the israel palestine struggle india is entering the most critical period in its history and that the current government and other elites are handing our enemies a victory
430947 perhaps it will help people know just how dangerous things here are
430948 the us and india are two great democracies we india must support the us war on terror it is the only thing we should do
430949 fear a negative response from muslims and a loss of votes even though more people believe india should openly ally itself with the us in the war on terror the politicians are afraid to be seen as anti muslim
430950 because they feel that these kinds of anti terror reports will build up feelings against muslims
430951 terrorists but they are not terrorists they are indian muslim institutions getting money from the saudis to create mosques that look like five star hotels
430952 if you are pro hindu you are called a racist
430953 if they believe their demands are not being met they can bring down the government this is why india still has not ratified the nuclear deal with the us
430954 he comes from west bengal and cannot represent his state without support of communists
430955 there is something of a generation gap between the established and generally older editors and publishers
430956 we must give people the real picture of israel palestine struggle
430957 that is as a land once under muslim hegemony and so by rights always under it they opposed indian partition in 1947 and the partition of palestine in 1948 because it would recognize the legitimacy of the non muslim state on land they consider their own
430958 despite adversities israel progressed a lot but we indians were far lagging behind
430959 if israel did not say to hell with those who wanted it to be soft it would be gone and if india does not do the same thing it will be gone because the official philosophy of the muslims is the same
430960 how has such a small country like israel been able to defeat all of the arabs and their terrorists
430961 i have to do more work to check my information
430962 axis of evil and axis of terror in this world are pakistan afghanistan iran
430963 there is not a single democracy between tel aviv and new delhi and if we keep taking the road of weakness our enemies could easily defeat us our foreign policy is to have friendly relations with our neighbors but our neighbors are all radical islamists and dictators
430964 its a crime that the communists are still in power they use intimidation and voter fraud but congress lets them because they want to stay in power if bjp and congress would come together and force a fair election the communists will lose
430965 small local papers publish in huge numbers and they are not part of the mainstream media they are just as frustrated with things as we are we want to channelize sic them to become an alternative media

430972 one of the biggest contemporary ironies is that being liberal in the united states of america home of historys greatest democracy has become dangerous that danger is particularly acute for religious liberals as the recent tragedy in knoxville demonstrated
430973 jim adkisson a tennessee aficionado of conservative talkshows took their hosts invective all too literally and shot up a liberal unitarian universalist congregation killing two and wounding six congregants watching a childrens musical caught up in a world of conservative talk radio he reportedly expected to be able to carry on shooting unimpeded by the spineless gay loving pacifists and was surprised when they tackled him and brought him down
430974 no conservatives did not cause this bloodbath jim adkisson allegedly did but in telling him liberals were the source of his every disaffection and woe conservatives certainly validated the hatred and madness that drove him
430975 it would be a fitting tribute to those who were lost in knoxville if this tragedy gave the authors of the ongoing morality play cause for pause and reflection or is accountability yet another lost conservative value

430988 the majority of the party supports boycotting the elections and i support it as well
430989 unfortunately we have no basis to believe that the upcoming election will be free and fair according to international standards
430990 we have not seen any election since 1993 that was democratic they have always been falsified this year i think the situation will be even worse

430995 on the good days the city struck michael as a beautiful woman who wasnt his type the rest of the time paris was a bad summer camp with weird counselors and lousy toilets
430996 this was the big night for me said hoff who also will swim the 100 and 800 freestyles later in the trials
430997 when i touched the wall after the 200 im i felt a big sense of relief
430998 after the 400 im i had to bring myself down each day ive had to keep myself in check because im not done yet im not going to celebrate too much until the last night then maybe ill get dessert or something
430999 she had a tough double wednesday and swam both races perfectly phelps said
431000 she is putting out fast times and im sure shes looking forward to getting over to beijing and swimming against the rest of the world
431001 i would have liked to have swum faster phelps said
431002 my fly has felt the best this year that it ever has im glad i secured a spot on the team and i can focus for the next month on what i have to do to get ready for beijing
431003 after the 200 im i felt like someone just kicked me in the stomach
431004 i hate to lose i hope to correct that i still have a month to train and beijing is going to be a lot different
431005 when i get in the water with him the last three or four times you know its going to take a world record to win im fortunate to be able to race him he makes me race even faster
431006 it could have gone either way im glad he swam the race he did because it helped me out
431007 i think we can expect more than we did a few months ago and thats exciting
431008 we feel like weve been an underdog since the last olympics and through the world championships on the ladies side we still feel like that we have a lot to prove when we get there and we have to get better but weve had some great swims
431009 these are some of our fastest times ever as a whole
431010 it sets up hopefully to have one of our best olympics there are a lot of countries that are going to step up because its an olympic year hopefully we can be the best and fastest team ever

431013 i only want to say that the king spoke to me
431014 what he said and quite distinctly for everyone to hear was get out of my way
431015 right now i feel that ive got my feet on the ground as far as my head is concerned
431016 shes been a starter ever since i was very young said torres now 41
431017 i looked at her and smiled and said here we are again
431018 i was very anxious very nervous torres said after clocking a time of 54
431019 i wasnt expecting to be that nervous it felt like my first olympic trials
431020 age is just a number i have great coaches and great people around me im able to recover and at my age its all about recovery
431021 i told officials i wanted to be an open book said torres who has had 12 to 15 tests since march
431022 you can dna test me blood test me urine test me whatever you want to do because i want people to know i am doing this right i am clean and i want a clean sport
431023 i swam against swimmers who were dirty my entire life its just something i wouldnt do its a real pain but i asked for this and i want to prove im clean i need to prove that a 40 year old is doing this clean and doing it the right way
431024 i have been training for the trials for so long
431025 i have been looking forward to it and it is very exciting for me
431026 this is very special in 2004 i wanted to win really bad but this time i think there is even more motivation for me everyone dreams about going to the olympics and to be here on team usa is unbelievable
431027 im going to take the same hunger i had in 2004 and try to bring home the gold
431028 there was always a little hope in me which is why i didnt quit
431029 then in my first year with alberto it was like yeah
431030 ive wanted to be an olympian for so long said goucher who went by her maiden name of kara grgas wheeler when she graduated from duluth east in 1996
431031 this is the childhood dream i dont mind talking about her struggles that makes me who i am i had to go through that i learned to appreciate running so much more because of it
431032 the medal proved to me i could compete with anybody on any given day
431033 in 04 i cried a lot but i came back and had a great year in 05
431034 i have a better perspective this time id love to have olympian next to my name because thats how people validate your career but im proud of what ive done
431035 i love the feeling of flying through the air and the olympics would be the ultimate who wouldnt try their hardest to get this opportunity
431036 but this is just one goal i have in my life it doesnt define who i am to me enjoying the event enjoying the sport and the experiences is more important than winning medals or making a lot of money
431037 when i was little i was a gymnast and i couldnt do a kip on the uneven bars
431038 i would come home frustrated every day and my mom said youll get it keep practicing
431039 when i did i was out of this world excited it was the first time i learned i could do something if i kept trying
431040 the lesson here is that every jump is not perfect
431041 but she pulled it out that is what you have to do in life pull yourself up refocus and try again she learned that as a little girl and i remind her of that still
431042 we didnt know if shed be able to walk again
431043 ive had a lot of great experiences these past four years working toward this
431044 i have the rest of my life to work nine to five
431045 four years shes been doing this getting up every day to lift taking care of her own schedule not making much money
431046 to do what shes done you really have to love it
431047 its not ideal to be coached long distance and its not the usual way to do things
431048 but it works for them because theyre so dedicated and they learn from each other shani is incredibly strong willed and strong physically which is why things progressed so well for her last year
431049 its awesome to train with her because shes so much fun and because i can try to mimic the things she does and do them as well as she can
431050 this is her dream and if she gets it its going to be very emotional because everyone knows how hard she has worked for it
431051 its hard to be apart but we keep the complaining to a minimum
431052 i dont think of it as a negative because im working toward a goal im doing what i have to do
431053 four years is a lot of time to dedicate to one day and its been a long four years im trying to do everything i can to get there and at the end of the day all i can do is give my best
431054 that was a hard year because amanda and i were coaching ourselves and we didnt have the structure we needed
431055 we were working so hard but i felt like i was jumping shorter every meet i was at my wits end but as frustrated as i was i knew it wasnt in me to quit thats not who i am
431056 thats when people mess up when they think oh my god this is the olympic trials
431057 i want to jump well whether im at a u of m meet or the olympics thats how i approach it
431058 some of the girls at the competitions are so serious its like life or death for them but this doesnt define me i wouldnt trade what i have in my life for a world record
431059 it was not a good jump it kind of surprised me when i walked away i was sure it was a qualifying mark but i had no idea it was a personal record
431060 i expected to be one and done which i wanted to do so i didnt waste any energy everything went according to plan
431061 oh yeah she said when asked if she is at a career peak
431062 we had a great plan this year from michael eskind their coach and its been steady progress we got the first jitters out today and were both hoping to jump well sunday

431065 i need to be up here where i can throw up
431066 i was so nervous for my first jump my heart was beating out of my chest but i knew i would pull it out this has been my goal for five years and im just so thankful
431067 it didnt feel like 47 feet but ill take it
431068 im not used to this weather and i felt drained and tired and had a lot of nerves going on it was definitely a fight out there on every jump
431069 this is huge for her for the university for the state of minnesota she put in the work every day in the cold and the wind she deserves it
431070 it was my prayer that she would to see how far shes come i cant believe how blessed she is
431071 we need to get some type of flame retardant uniform in case he catches on fire
431072 this is the best field ever put together the talent is amazing i dont think the final in beijing is going to be as strong as the final here
431073 if you would have blinked you would have missed it
431074 for the human body to go that fast is awesome
431075 getting a gold medal is my biggest motivation and i want to save the best for last my expectations are huge going into the olympics
431076 tell her i am sorry i did not know what i was doing
431077 ill kill the remorseless bastard who killed my baby ill never recover from this my baby is in bits they cant even find her i need her back i just want to get my baby back where she belongs
431078 that monster has taken my girl he took her life and i want his she wasnt an angel but she didnt deserve that

431138 snoop dogg and the band appreciate the professionalism displayed by the texas troopers thursday afternoon
431139 the tour bus was stopped for what was thought to be expired tags upon further investigation it was determined the bus was current on its registration and was eventually allowed to continue to snoop doggs show in dallas
431140 the alleged offense a class b misdemeanour was listed as less than two ounces of marijuana the young men arrested dont appear to have prior criminal records i expect that once everything has run its course there will be a favourable resolution to this case
431141 the routine stop was otherwise uneventful later in the evening snoop dogg and the band entertained a great crowd in dallas as they performed with 311 as part of the unity tour

431149 this lawsuit is ridiculous and riddled with lie upon lie from verne troyer and his camp it is in our opinion a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less than average career in the wake of his most recent failure in the love guru
431150 the only abuse that ever occurred in their household was that of emotional abuse inflicted upon ranae and her dog lacy on the occasions when he hit ranae and her dog with his reaching sticks or kicked them when having one of his drunken rages

431186 ill bet my new friend would like some water too
431187 to tell you the truth i was starting to get bored
431188 when you closed the box it was all dark and i think he was too shy to say much so i tried some friendly small talk after a while i realized that he must be on a speech fast and i wasnt being very helpful by tempting him to talk for the whole night i kept quiet and that made the night seem extra long but now youve opened the box and its day and im happy
431189 yesterday he was sorting through a pile of old books and stuff you dont suppose he got klonked on the head or something do you
431190 i bet he got to ride in a garbage truck then we love adventures on big trucks ill find him and well have some real fun

431199 hey horatio my man this sure is one mutha fluffin blockhouse i shonuf dig it on the outside baby but inside man i got the heebie geebies
431200 what about those mushrooms that grow up at danglydong dell
431201 things look kind of groovy after eating a few of those
431202 you better believe it horatio my man did ya recognize the badge
431203 oh man you musta seen it it kinda stood out a whole bit
431204 so what was so special about it apart from the location that is
431205 a high priest of the church of the painted privates and you know baby the dude only told me where i could join up im goin there right now see ya around horatio baby give my best to ya mamma
431206 can you change the spark plug of a hardly worthit with yer teeth
431207 these muthas aint got no idea that horatio shonuf offed the three witches last summer
431208 you state under oath i should remind you that the accused actually helped you bring down the dragon slayer airship and thereby saved the town of chunderland from certain disaster
431209 so what about the fact that he burnt down his aunties house
431210 do you believe that it was a deliberate attempt to murder his auntie
431211 had your friend zack not shoved his plasterers trowel through the stud wall of his aunties house would you consider the possibility that zack might have found some other means to cause the demise of his auntie crud
431212 i think the questions fair it shows state of mind
431213 well he could have put her head in the mangle
431214 wouldnt you have placed her head in the mangle rather than burn down her house while she was out shopping i mean its obvious isnt it
431215 im not having that blankensdorft git getting all the credit for what my horatio did
431216 everybody knows it was horatio and his two time duplicates who saved the dragon slayer i mean its all on video tape isnt it
431217 i couldnt believe it so ive brought it with me to prove that i wasnt dreaming
431218 my brother professor desmond squealch invented a time machine that brought two duplicate horatios from the future the resulting merging of the time lines means that he forgot how to make a time machine and the rampaging moth had its dna altered by a time storm and reverted to its caterpillar state
431219 certainly there was no sign of the accused there of course ill run this tape through some extremely complicated algae rhythms in our experimental bio yoghurt computer to see if i can find any sign of a plasterers trowel but im pretty certain on this preliminary evidence that zack blankensdorft wasnt there
431220 it was when i visited the penitentiary i tripped on some cheesecake just inside the door of the waiting room i then fell into tattys lap its all on video tape too tatty took it before he left ive seen it im all covered in cheesecake and rolling about in his lap it makes me look like some sort of evil pole dancer or dairy product deviant he said that if i didnt lie in court hed send this to my school and ive never even heard of oral sex
431221 the part about horatio giving me oral sex was accurate i mean is it likely that i would leave cheesecake just inside the door of the waiting room i mean its ridiculous isnt it scandalous absolutely unthinkable
431222 first of all id like a cup of tea then i think we should go save brutus from the church of the painted privates
431223 i used to be a member myself excuse the puns come on
431224 ill tell you what were going to do nothing absolutely nothing
431225 at least not for a couple of weeks i know prince rupert reasonably well i can get brutus out with just a careless wink of my eye but lets not hurry lets make him stew a while then when hes back to his old self again well set him free hey maybe well spend a while comparing tattoos
431226 the proposed law would require businesses with 20 or more employees to establish a program to promote the use of transit by its workforce participation by employees would be voluntary businesses would have to select one of three options two of them would place a financial burden on the employer and one is considered cost neutral the two choices that come with an added cost offering workers free transit passes or vanpool reimbursement providing door to door shuttle service on vans or buses a third option would allow businesses to tap into an established federal program in which employees can set up pretax commuter accounts to pay for travel on train bus or ferries or by vanpool the accounts could not pay for parking under the san francisco proposal the benefit of the pretax program is that employees would save what amounts to 40 percent on their commute costs
431227 the plan is the latest attempt by san francisco officials to impose a mandate on businesses the city has required paid sick leave health care benefits and a minimum wage that is one of the nations highest but unlike the past mandates on the private sector this one has not run into major opposition from business leaders because of the potential economic benefit to them
431228 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again

431359 at 61 almost no one alive has lived as much rock n roll history as mr kooper in his assorted lives as performer producer sideman songwriter author talent scout enthusiast critic and muse
431360 the first thing you want to do after listening to this cd is listen to it again which is about the strongest endorsement an album can get al koopers voice has been sorely missed all these years
431361 kooper reminds us that he is a major talent from the revelatory songwriting to the nuanced world weary singing to the ease in which he plumbs the subterranean depths of his soul and comes up with sheer gold a career defining work
431362 its a special kind of set from a rock survivor you should pay some attention to especially if you care about what rock in the contemporary era is all about trust me its not just for dinosaurs
431363 this is an old school record lushly produced and kooper would have thrown in the kitchen sink if it were in tune

431431 i was in the subdivision doing an extra patrol in the area for drug related activities when i overheard the dispatcher telling patrol units about a 911 call regarding a kid who got his arm bitten of by an alligator it was a kid we had to go
431432 but when we got there we got there blocked by a chain link fence and the kid was about a mile and a half in
431433 all we could do was run i grabbed a towel i had in my unit and me and gordon took off running i made it to the kid first he was out by the pond where the alligator attacked
431434 i pulled him to the top of the levee he had bad lacerations on his neck and his arm was just gone i wrapped him in the towel and ran back with him
431435 i didnt want him to see his arm he talked about paint ball and he said he was thirsty i told him i had a mountain dew back in the unit but he couldnt have all of it because i needed some too
431436 if hes talking hes breathing and he was thinking he was making sense

431486 im disappointed it is just a feeble excuse for doing nothing about salt levels they dont want to lower salt levels because they are nervous about consumer reaction and people not liking the taste with less salt
431487 if you have not got sufficient preservative in a product like ham you get pockets where the salt levels are too low to prevent the formation of the botulism toxin
431488 this will force us to reduce it the shelf life further and with that come serious food safety concerns not least the risk of botulism
431489 we are very worried about the stricter targets and believe that reducing salt further has implications for food safety and shelf life of products
431490 we are already getting complaints from retailers that consumers dont like the blandness of many sandwiches to meet existing salt targets sandwich makers dont add salt to sandwiches at all but it is in products such as cheese bacon and ham well soon be at a point where people stop buying sandwiches and make them at home where they add as much salt as they want this would affect an important industry we sell 2 8 billion packs of sandwiches a year with a market value of 5 25 billion pounds
431491 we are already reformulating many recipes but we have got reports that consumers dont like the taste especially in some healthy ranges of meals such as lasagne where there has been a decline in sales
431492 peter sherratt the general secretary of the salt association said that feed back from its members suggested that the agency targets had gone too far
431493 there was no evidence of widespread problems with the quality
431494 the government would have been better advised to hold them back so we could be assured that we were looking at authentic results
431495 so many doubts have been expressed that there has to be question marks against whatever results are published next week if we are going to compare them properly against previous years and use them as an accurate reflection of the performance of the system we need to know that the results are as accurate as they could be
431496 a fall in the proportion of pupils achieving the expected level by up to two percentage points
431497 if these are more accurate figures it just shows that the small rises in results we have seen in the last few years have been completely bogus it will just reiterate the fact that standards of reading writing and maths have plateaued over the last six or seven years we should be getting all children to the required standard
431498 the government has been unbelievably complacent about the uks record on greenhouse gases
431499 the reality is that we have simply exported our emissions to countries that do the manufacturing that we used to do in the past
431500 rather than hiding behind dodgy data and relying on green gimmicks the government need to make urgent changes to move the country to a low carbon economy

431518 now i realize how lucky i was to get that cabin thats what got us out of there
431519 just as many of the lands that make up todays national parks were the spiritual homes for the indigenous tribes who lived there they had a profound and often spiritual impact on the settlers who first saw them and on the visionaries who fought tirelessly to preserve them as the common property of the american people
431520 they saw in them a visual tangible representation of gods majesty our film celebrates the beauty of these parks and the vision and foresight of the men and women who made sure that this land would be preserved
431521 making this film was one of the greatest joys of my life
431522 each park is unique and has its own fascinating historical story but they are all connected by the transformative idea that they belong to each of us providing a shared place that lives in the memory of every individual and every family that has visited them over the years and they are connected by the notion that individual americans in the best possible example of democracy worked to make sure that future generations could enjoy them
431523 there was a sense that in europe you had the roman coliseum or notre dame or the cologne cathedral but we didnt have anything like that in america
431524 but we did have these spectacular natural landscapes that were as unique and ancient as anything in the old world so they would become our treasures they would be the source of our national pride but unlike in europe they did not belong to monarchs or nobility they belong to everyone
431525 its easy to be in awe of the scenic beauty of our national parks and lose sight of their context within our nations history
431526 the national parks brings to life what the national parks say about our character as a nation and a people the film surfaces hidden histories of passionate and visionary individuals who persevered in preserving these majestic lands and historic sites for the publics enrichment for generations to come beginning with public television stations broad audience and continuing with powerful new media were confident that this film like all of kens films will grip our countrys attention and spark a dialogue about the importance of these sites and the need for on going preservation and education
431527 the national parks like our previous collaborations with ken burns will be a signature publishing event
431528 it is the first accounting of the national parks to weave together dramatic narrative personal testimony and breathtaking images indeed of all the books we have published in partnership with ken this may be the most visually spectacular

431584 it has been so far a pretty decent weekend and the team have done a great job in improving the car again even from the last race
431585 the pace of our car is great and it is a great day to have me and heikki 1 2
431586 it is about time we did that for the team and weve both done a great job it is very satisfying we were quick in testing yesterday q2 looked a bit close but it was tyre dependent and we made the right choice at the end so i am very happy
431587 you can never be too comfortable for sure but i feel safe to be in the position i am in
431588 we have speed to push on and challenge for the win tomorrow is another day and ill make sure i do the preparations tonight and tomorrow morning
431589 it would be great to have a 1 2 for the team the team deserve it and i think me and heikki have been pushing hard so we both deserve it
431590 i wasnt 100 percent happy with my laps in q3 because i went onto the track a bit at the wrong time
431591 there were so many slow cars on their out lap i like to go flat and quickest but you cannot pass them so it is tricky to prepare the tyres
431592 i could not prepare the tyres like i was supposed to i could not do a great lap like in q1 and q2
431593 we are pretty strong we didnt seem to be pretty strong until this morning but then look at laptimes of q1 and q2 i think we are there for sure we are not like the race in hockenheim and silverstone was a big lottery but we are there and i think i can push these guys tomorrow

431597 as many sports have said china presents difficulties for athletes going in and being there for a period of time
431598 anything more than five or six days and they inevitably end up with some sort of respiratory problem so that was why many of the sports who dont have to be in there early are choosing not to go in and the outcome is that its almost impossible to go for the opening ceremony

431621 we have tanks bradleys paladins we are a conventional force if the united states went to war against a conventional enemy
431622 but because we arent going against a conventional enemy and were doing a counterinsurgency mission we had to refocus our training

431649 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
431650 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
431651 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
431652 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

431656 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
431657 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
431658 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
431659 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
431660 weve had a lot of dented doors broken windows brawls outside six people trying to get in when can only take four said kim jakku of kelowna cabs
431661 people will start to call cabs because theyre tired said one night clubber
431662 two oclock in the morning is garbage for the simple fact that everyone is still hammered and ready to go he said
431663 it involves interacting with the people doing positive re enforcement and helping them get out of the area in the safest way possible
431664 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
431665 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
431666 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
431667 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
431668 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
431669 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
431670 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
431671 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
431672 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
431673 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
431674 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
431675 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
431676 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
431677 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
431678 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
431679 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
431680 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
431681 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
431682 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
431683 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
431684 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
431685 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
431686 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
431687 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
431688 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
431689 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
431690 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
431691 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
431692 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
431693 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
431694 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
431695 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
431696 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
431697 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
431698 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
431699 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
431700 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
431701 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
431702 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
431703 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
431704 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
431705 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
431706 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
431707 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
431708 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
431709 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
431710 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
431711 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
431712 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
431713 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
431714 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
431715 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
431716 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
431717 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
431718 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
431719 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
431720 astrodome redevelopment corporation is anxious to see the tenants comments and address any concerns they have and move forward quickly
431721 im of two minds on this wireless sd card its clever unique
431722 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
431723 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
431724 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
431725 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
431726 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
431727 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
431728 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
431729 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
431730 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
431731 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
431732 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
431733 who are open to doing something on the production side
431734 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
431735 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
431736 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
431737 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
431738 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
431739 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
431740 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
431741 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
431742 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
431743 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers

431883 sri lanka ranks south asias no 1 human rights violator
431884 sri lankas human rights indicators must be considered within a context of very high levels of impunity which tend to suggest a worsening over the human rights picture over the long term
431885 is based on comparative assessment of records of the governments in 2007 on nine thematic issues crucial for enjoyment of human rights political freedom right to life judiciary and administration of justice status or effectiveness of national human rights institutions press freedom violence against women violations of the rights of the child violations of the rights of the minorities and indigenous tribal peoples and repression on human rights defenders
431886 sri lanka scored the highest negative points for the right to life the rights of the child attacks on human rights defenders and violations of the rights of the minorities
431887 discrimination lies at the heart of the problem and the introduction of restrictions on tamils travelling to colombo are a powerful symbol of government intent the political ramifications of the exclusion not least in terms of prospects for a peaceful settlement of the conflict of an entire ethnic group from the nations capital are of deep concern

431895 el uso de la fuerza tiene un rol pero los esfuerzos del ej rcito para capturar o matar a terroristas deben estar acompa ados de medidas para promover la participaci n local en el gobierno y en programas econ micos para estimular el desarrollo as como esfuerzos para entender los rencores que suelen estar en el origen de las insurrecciones

431910 i thought deja vu was a movie but its real life for us
431911 i thought we played well but we had three goal scorers and nine behind kickers so instead of having a big lead we had a little lead and then they were able to get us at the finish
431912 our aim is to be as competitive as possible in each region
431913 i felt good the ball was coming out pretty nice i was very happy with the way i threw it seemed like a double or a home run on every hit but for the most part things went well i had good command
431914 what wouldnt do a thing to lower gas prices is john mccains new proposal a proposal adopted by george bush as well to open up floridas coastline for offshore drillling
431915 offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices tomorrow it would not lower gas prices this year it will not lower gas prices five years from now in fact pres bushs own energy department says we wont say a drop of oil from his own proposal until 2017 and you wont see full production until 2030
431916 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
431917 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

431966 mbongo has become rather sly about getting the lions share of treats by assuming a great interest in some other part of the cage until ngagi becoming fearful that he is missing something wanders over that way when mbongo leads him further away ngagi becomes actually so engrossed in the mystery that he fails to see mbongos stealthy return mbongo silently opens his big red mouth and permits you to stuff your fruit or food into it he shuts it quickly and walks away with the greatest air of unconcern you can imagine chewing most surreptitiously in spite of his suspicions ngagi never quite catches on to what has happened

431972 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease

431980 chill out dude youre being rude im talking to jerry right now
431981 you wore your hair down for me tonight because i asked you to and now you arent paying any attention to me
431982 a fascinating read for anyone with an interest in the amazing world where science meets crime
431983 were really hopeful that we can improve the model for criminology
431984 bees have much simpler brains and so understanding how bees are recruited to flowers is much easier than understanding the complex thoughts of a serial murderer
431985 im not the first person to ever be traded here im not the first person to ever play here everyone else seems to adjust to it and do just fine im sure itll be an adjustment period but ill be fine
431986 der deutsche journalisten verband hat die bildjournalisten vor der unterzeichnung eines fotografenvertrages zu den konzerten von loreena mckennitt in deutschland gewarnt
431987 der in englischer rechtssprache verfasste vertrag verst t in mehrfacher hinsicht gegen deutsches recht und schr nkt die fotografen bei ihrer berichterstattung ein
431988 die entscheidung ber die nutzung der fotos trifft nach deutschem recht der urheber und nicht der tourneeveranstalter
431989 wir sind nicht mehr anfang der 70er jahre also k nnen wir auch kein programm wie anfang der 70er jahre machen
431990 im probably going to be in a cast for around three months
431991 obviously i dont want to rush it but im hoping to be back playing again in six months time
431992 the legs been a bit sore for the last few days but the pain seems to have settled down a bit now
431993 fitness wise we are looking good as well i dont think well have a problem and im sure we will more than hold our own
431994 ive been shocked to be honest at all the support ive had from the fans when i was leaving in the ambulance i could hear everyone singing my name
431995 its nice to know theyre behind you and i just want to thank the fans for their support
431996 but mommy if i throw them all in the play room like this and then close the door you cant see them

432000 aminul mashud and rafique have vast experience of playing cricket at the highest level and can pass on their knowledge to the next generation
432001 ashley paul comes up with a little bit of background
432002 but we are prepared to have a look and make decisions onward after that
432003 everyone has said to me to get hold of him and have a look at him
432004 he again is another guy that is a bit short of match fitness but we have had him for a couple of days he is certainly not short of confidence though
432005 i have sat with tyrone and i have said to him that we would like a longer look at him so we would extend the period for him to stay at the football club
432006 he has got the weekend to chat to his parents and discuss it with them and then well discuss where he feels he is at
432007 for two years weve narrowly lost to kent so to win by a clear twenty points and without losing a match this season is fantastic it was a shame the rain intervened but it doesnt feel any less special
432008 this is my first year as captain and it couldnt have gone any better the future of sussex cricket looks really bright with plenty of young players pushing for places theres no reason why we cant stay at the top for many years to come
432009 wait did i say coastal drilling wouldnt help i meant coastal drilling is great
432010 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
432011 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
432012 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
432013 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
432014 if some expanded drilling is the price of getting an otherwise good bill through congress its still a bad idea but so be it
432015 federal laws that prohibit increased drilling for oil offshore or in wilderness areas
432016 maybe we should invest in more alternative energies and expand drilling you know best of both worlds
432017 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
432018 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
432019 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it

432026 it remains the single biggest threat to our stability and to our progress
432027 it is time we all realize that the pursuit of narrow geo political interests and the use of militant radicalism as an instrument of policy can not succeed or serve any long term purpose

432030 the rumors which began in england about her health are dramatic overstated and untrue
432031 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
432032 britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town
432033 and the implications for ottawa are pretty much the same
432034 financial markets are getting more innovative and you are getting some very low risk businesses that can support more debt and investors are finding ways of having them carry more debt in order to avoid the corporate income tax
432035 he is a bit like the dutch boy who has his finger in the dyke he plugs one hole but then bingo another hole pops up
432036 i am not going to talk about anything that is subject to current market activity
432037 when you are talking about a company becoming an income trust under the old rules you are talking about a company getting a preferred tax rate when you are talking about a corporation continuing as a corporation but under different ownership it is still taxable at the same rate
432038 the effect of what he is doing is exactly the opposite of what he intended because the holders of income trusts pay lots of tax
432039 all of these trusts are now being taken over in such a way so that the new owners will pay no tax
432040 so instead of a situation where a lot of personal taxes were being paid you are having these induced takeovers by highly leveraged private equity companies that will pay no tax
432041 some problems persist with how individual policy measures are calculated and with their projected emission reductions
432042 individual policy measures continue to be presented without these sources of overestimation adequately being taken into account

432086 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
432087 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
432088 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
432089 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident

432091 the recently revealed lawsuit that was sheepishly leaked to the press by troyers attorney is an abomination of the legal process
432092 hes not only good on the basketball court but also off it hes a good person not just a good player
432093 in the last two years hes started to look like a great player he is the first of the really big guys who could really play
432094 the others couldnt really move certainly his height is pretty incredible but he is very skilful so i dont think it is his height alone if yao was a little shorter i think he would still be a great player
432095 yao is just tremendous i think every sports league in the world would dream of having him
432096 i think its a win win situation the nba has yao ming there and that draws more attention from china
432097 and yao ming playing at the highest level can help raise the standard of chinese basketball and maybe make a breakthrough in olympic results
432098 i think being as big as he is pretty clearly does put unusual stress on his feet

432103 my feelings about bareback i think its the right and choice of the model to participate in that kind of action however there needs to be more out there on education and the real risks involved a source other than the producers filming the bareback work bareback porn producers do need to take some responsibility for putting images out there that would not otherwise be seen so readily by todays youth as a young gay man i should not have to search through crap and sift through shit online to find real information it should be up front and center everywhere i go in school in the gay community on the street and being taught by the elders of our community no i dont think condoms should be industry standard but i do think that we need to stand up and work more preventatively

432119 es war bisher ein ziemlich ordentliches wochenende und das team hat gro artige arbeit geleistet indem es das auto erneut verbessert hat sogar im vergleich zum vergangenen rennen
432120 die geschwindigkeit unseres autos ist gro artig und es ist ein gro artiger tag mich und heikki auf den pl tzen eins und zwei zu haben
432121 es ist an der zeit dass wir dies f r das team geschafft haben wir haben beide gro artige arbeit geleistet es ist sehr befriedigend wir waren bei den tests gestern schnell im zweiten qualifying durchgang sah es etwas eng aus aber das war von den reifen abh ngig und wir haben schlussendlich die richtige wahl getroffen ich bin aus diesem grund sehr gl cklich
432122 man darf niemals so zuversichtlich sein das steht fest aber ich f hle mich sicher in der position in der ich mich befinde wir haben die geschwindigkeit um druck auszu ben und um den sieg zu k mpfen
432123 morgen ist ein anderer tag und ich werde sicherstellen dass ich die notwendigen vorbereitungen heute abend und morgen vormittag erledige es w re gro artig f r das team einen doppelsieg zu holen das team verdient dies und ich denke dass ich und heikki alles gegeben haben und wir es aus diesem grund beide verdienen

432127 we were quickest on the softer tyre so we had planned to use it for q3 but the track temperature was up so it was having a big affect on the tyre it was the safer option to use the harder tyre as it does not grain as much i lost a little bit of time in the second sector so ive got a little bit in the bag

432132 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
432133 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck john mccormack
432134 ive been leaning in that direction for a while now
432135 ive been wanting to commit to them and the time was finally right its just a wonderful situation for me

432140 i missed a few shots here and there but i kept going and when you hole a shot like that on the 11th it keeps the momentum going
432141 what was really special was coming down the last eight with that great support teeing up so early compared with leaders we still had a huge crowd and it was very special coming up 18 i hope it will be like that tomorrow
432142 im here im enjoying myself im focused on my game i havent changed anything my routines are the same i have the same coach and caddy
432143 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away
432144 while i realize its been a long time since you assisted my daughter with her real estate purchase i just wanted to express my heartfelt thanks
432145 during one whirlwind weekend early in 2004 greg swann helped me and my husband find just the right valley home because we had never lived in the desert we werent sure what we wanted or needed in an arizona house but later commented that it was the perfect place for us our avondale home was cozy and comfortable yet offered lots of room for company was located in a great neighborhood admired for its gorgeous landscaping especially the backyard and provided easy access to work shopping hiking trails and church because of gregs expertise research and tenacity by sunday afternoon we narrowed our choices to a house that had only been listed a few days he not only gave us his undivided attention and energy for the weekend he also educated us on the idiosyncrasies of the desert and points of interest around the valley two and a half years later when my husband was informed of yet another job transfer one of our first thoughts was we need to call bloodhound realty we knew selling our home would be more difficult than buying it because the real estate climate had morphed from a sellers market to a buyers market and we knew bloodhound would work hard to create interest in our property that they did despite the fact that 48 000 other homes glutted the multi list we received an offer within two weeks but thats not the end of the story after the movers packed our belongings and we checked into a motel in our new city expecting to stay two days until both houses closed the glitches began too numerous to mention we wont go into the gory glitch details however i will say that cathleens calm demeanor as well as her determination to stay in constant contact with all the entities involved and to work through the problems got us through a tough time cathleen and greg are friendly and capable intelligent and efficient they are quick to answer phone calls and e mails no matter how mundane or ignorant the questions or comments best of all they are both genuinely great people bloodhound realty is the best
432146 immigration agents were in postville again and that this time they were dressed as civilians and walking around the streets
432147 people began calling the church saying they didnt know what to do that they didnt want to leave their homes there was a lot of fear and more uncertainty
432148 i was followed by a man in a car when i went to the post office and he didnt take his eyes off me until i pulled my pant leg up and showed him i had an ankle device
432149 whenever we do an enforcement action these kinds of rumors always fly rampant
432150 if were looking for someone and we find them on the street of course well arrest them
432151 they have no choices at this point because nothing is happening in their cases
432152 thats the biggest issue for them that so much is unknown
432153 now they have to rely on charity for food with which to feed their kids
432154 and they face eviction they could end up wearing their ankle bracelets on the street
432155 i have 26 windows open and most windows have multiple tabs open each one has 30 tabs
432156 i brought pictures in and presented them to the committee of very premature babies from my neonatal resuscitation book from the american pediatric association trying to show them unwanted babies were being cast aside babies the same age were wanted
432157 it seems that senator obama is described as having one of the most extreme positions that one can find when it comes to the issue of abortion in this article i want to briefly investigate the issue of abortion and determine where senator obama is regarding this issue within the context of the protecting rights of the mother and the developing baby
432158 however i do want to consider shifting some of the meaning of terminology that is always used with this issue fetus and viability it seems to me that given how far todays science and medicine have advanced since 1973 when roe v wade was decided i would hope that we can consider taking a deeper look regarding what science might be able to tell us in terms of the development of the fetus instead of primarily addressing the question in terms of viability of the fetus why not first try to answer the question of when the emergence of a human consciousness or behavior begins then perhaps that could that be the starting point where the states opposing interests begin to collide
432159 i suspect that senator obamas after the fact defense of his votes against the illinois bill were nothing more than political pandering for votes of the worst kind
432160 again the main stream media lets senator obama have a pass just the way they have regarding serious allegations surrounding his associations with rezko wright ayers farrakhan and the many other questionable characters in his life the media is just now starting to cover the john edwards scandal only because they cant avoid it however they continue to avoid like the plague the allegations of larry sinclair that he and senator obama used cocaine and engaged in consensual gay sex in 1999

432174 u s citizens should be aware of the risk posed by the deteriorating security situation in mexico and along the border
432175 violent criminal activity including murder and kidnapping in mexico has increased
432176 how is it that a kidnapping in a feign country of a feign national gets investigated and resolved by american law enforcement while other not so connected americans who are currently being held for ransom some who are believed to have been kidnapped from american soil and taken to a feign country and held for ransom while still other americans have been executed murdered wounded and held for ransom in mexico with no apparent u s law enforcement investigation or follow up how can that be
432177 suffer from lack of funds and training and the judicial system is weak overworked and inefficient
432178 i worry that the inability of local law enforcement to come to grips with rising drug warfare kidnappings and random street violence will have a chilling effect on the cross border exchange tourism and commerce so vital to the regions prosperity
432179 statistics vary among watchdog groups but they agree that mexico has surpassed colombia a country plagued by decades of guerrilla and drug violence in the number of journalists killed each year
432180 many mexican reporters particularly in the embattled border states have stopped writing about organized crime and as the drug war spreads south journalists across the country are becoming targets on may 3 world press freedom day the decapitated body of a local drug dealer turned up outside a newspaper in the eastern port city of veracruz according to local press reports the killers left this warning for milo youll all pay you know it and more heads of damned reporters are going to roll the threat was presumed to be directed at milo vera a local columnist theres total impunity said jose antonio calcanio president of the federation of mexican journalists associations which represents 137 journalist groups nationwide the government has no interest in resolving any of these cases calcanio said its only when theres a prominent case like amado ramirez that they pretend to act but then they forget and nothing happens two suspects were arrested in the days after the radio hosts murder but both were released on bail many of ramirezs colleagues suspect the men were scapegoats
432181 the u s government would like to think that drug violence is just a problem south of the rio grande it isnt
432182 were seeing outright lawlessness along the u s mexican border things are just getting out of hand
432183 u s citizens should be aware of the risk posed by the deteriorating security situation
432184 if the same circumstance that now exist in mexico existed in any other country the u s state dept would advise americans to not even go there
432185 if its not safe for u s soldiers than it is unsafe for other americans
432186 what we do believe that we need in the region in north america is more integration not less integration

432197 table tennis is a key part of chinese life and its even become a part of our culture

432201 ob die anatomischen strukturen m nnlicher und weiblicher gehirne berhaupt das denken beeinflussen
432202 wie sieht das denn aus was sie unter dem mikroskop sehen
432203 kann man vielleicht doch zeigen dass es gr nde im hirn gibt daf r dass m nner besser einparken k nnen als frauen
432204 wir sprechen hier erst ber den allerersten schritt wie sich das auf die verhaltensebene letztendlich niederschl gt das k nnen wir jetzt mit dieser rein anatomischen untersuchung nicht sagen
432205 frauen sind emotionaler m nner aggressiver frauen haben mehr sprachgef hl m nner werfen besser die unterschiede zwischen m nnlichen und weiblichen gehirnen scheinen gr er zu sein als wissenschaftler noch vor zehn jahren angenommen haben
432206 so sind m nnliche gehirne im mittel etwa elf prozent gr er bezogen auf das k rpergewicht ist der unterschied jedoch nur gering und ihre gro hirnrinde in der das bewusste denken stattfindet hat einige milliarden neurone mehr

432248 dan karena kepercayaan dalam nama yesus maka nama itu telah menguatkan orang yang kamu lihat dan kamu kenal ini dan kepercayaan itu telah memberi kesembuhan kepada orang ini di depan kamu semua
432249 jadi siapa yang ada di dalam kristus ia adalah ciptaan baru yang lama sudah berlalu sesungguhnya yang baru sudah datang
432250 marilah kita melakukannya dengan mata yang tertuju kepada yesus yang memimpin kita dalam iman dan yang membawa iman kita itu kepada kesempurnaan yang dengan mengabaikan kehinaan tekun memikul salib ganti sukacita yang disediakan bagi dia yg sekarang duduk di sebelah kanan takhta allah
432251 sebab di dalam dia kita hidup kita bergerak kita ada seperti yang telah juga dikatakan oleh pujangga pujanggamu sebab kita ini dari keturunan allah juga
432252 sesudah kesusahan jiwanya ia akan melihat terang dan menjadi puas dan hamba ku itu sebagai orang yang benar akan membenarkan banyak orang oleh hikmatnya dan kejahatan mereka dia pikul
432253 dengan siapa hendak kamu samakan aku seakan akan aku seperti dia firman yang mahakudus arahkanlah matamu ke langit dan lihatlah siapa yang menciptakan semua bintang itu dan menyuruh segenap tentara mereka keluar sambil memanggil nama mereka sekaliannya satu pun tiada yang tak hadir oleh sebab ia maha kuasa dan maha kuat

432265 non c nessun taglio e le risorse previste per il rinnovo dei contratti del pubblico impiego saranno stanziati nella finanziaria
432266 limpegno del governo resta quello previsto in base allinflazione programmata
432267 i risparmi delle consulenze e quelli ricavati dalle collaborazioni interne dei dirigenti
432268 se si continua su questa linea afferma podda a settembre lo sciopero sar inevitabile per sostenere la nostra piattaforma e tutti i cittadini
432269 non ci sar pi quella franchigia di uno due tre giorni senza alcun controllo basta con i medici compiacenti con i dirigenti che non si curano di accertare le assenze dei propri dipendenti con i lavoratori che abusano di una situazione tutto sommato di privilegio la pubblica amministrazione invece deve avere le stesse regole del privato
432270 bisogna costruire una convergenza tra settore pubblico e privato perch non possono pi essere due mondi separati non pi accettabile che nel pubblico impiego ci sia il doppio di assenteismo rispetto al privato che non ci sia produttivit che non ci sia trasparenza nei bilanci e nei comportamenti che non si misuri la soddisfazione dei consumatori cittadini
432271 io ritengo prosegue che almeno un terzo del nostro differenziale negativo di crescita sia dovuto allinefficienza della pubblica amministrazione il mio quindi non un accanimento terapeutico nei confronti del pubblico impiego
432272 per gli anni 2010 2011 prosegue il testo laccesso al finanziamento integrativo a carico dello stato subordinato alla stipula di una intesa fra stato e regioni
432273 io ho sempre ricevuto la visita fiscale anche per un solo giorno di malattia
432274 circolare del ministro dellinnovazione sulle assenze poche novit molta propaganda
432275 chi ha mal di testa o mal di denti ormai va al lavoro comunque proprio per evitare la visita fiscale per poi ci sono i furbi che riescono a stare a casa 20 giorni con un certificato rilasciato da un medico compiacente
432276 e evidente che un costo aggiuntivo ma se la pubblica amministrazione ha le risorse per un investimento di questo tipo che si pone come obiettivo quello di combattere le malattie fittizie non vedo perch non debba farlo anche aumentare le ore di disponibilit del dipendente non mi sembra unabnormit chi malato sta a casa se ha delle esigenze particolari legate al suo stato di salute pu sempre dimostrarlo
432277 e giusto che chi ha malato non percepisca la parte di retribuzione legata alla produttivit se per le somme stanziate vengono semplicemente trattenute dallamministrazione il provvedimento mira solo a fare cassa andrebbero invece assegnate previa verifica agli altri colleghi che sono costretti a lavorare di pi quando c un malato se si intendono raggiungere i medesimi obiettivi

432606 in bringing many sons to glory it was fitting that god for whom and through whom everything exists should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering

432613 i was skating in my 20s when most of the kids i was competing against were like 16 17 18 years old i had been doing it since the beginning just skating around central park back in the day
432614 with skating it really became whats next and i almost hate myself for it because skating was my thing
432615 i loved skating more than anything in the world but i had been doing it professionally for ten years and it really did become a job and it wasnt something i really loved or enjoyed doing anymore
432616 there was just a lot of wear and tear on the body
432617 i was getting beat up and as the sport progressed it just kept getting more and more dangerous so i just decided to hang up the skates and not skate anymore
432618 i cant stand standing still and ive always stayed pretty active my assistant manager at the time was training jiu jitsu and i was a big wrestler back in high school so i thought it would be funny to go and grapple with him because he was a skinny little guy i went to his academy and he just tore me up for two hours straight and i was instantly hooked on it
432619 she loves watching it and fortunately i havent lost yet so she hasnt watched me get beat up yet maybe shell get a different view of it if i get beat up pretty good but right now shes loving it shes supportive and a big fan of the sport
432620 i have a really good job right now and im not into this because i need to make a living in mma
432621 i truly love the training and the camaraderie with all the guys i train with and im gonna keep doing it because i enjoy it whatever comes comes
432622 one of the biggest advantages i have right now is that ive kinda done this all before
432623 this isnt my first time dealing with cameras press interviews or performing in front of a large group of people now anytime youre in a fight youre gonna be nervous anybody who says otherwise is lying but at the same time the weeks leading up to it and all the press that goes along with it the fact that ive done that all before does give me a little bit of an advantage

432644 for six months the chancellor has been trying to cannibalize criswell college to fund his building program at the church which will cost 170 to 240 million
432645 furthermore the chancellor has stated and started a plan to stack the criswell college board with trustees that will go along with his plan to liquidate college assets including our campus and kcbi for the financial benefit of the church
432646 neither the deacons nor i have any plan to sell kcbi or the campus of criswell college period
432647 given that our church building committee just engaged an architect i find it strange that dr johnson would claim to know how much our building project which is still several years away is going to cost this along with the alleged plan to sell college assets is just another example of dr johnsons overactive imagination
432648 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms
432649 i wish i can explain it or someone can explain that to me
432650 its hard seeing tremendous defense tremendous pitching you go in there and dont do the job its disappointing
432651 i dont need any extra motivation my motivation is to win
432652 im very proud of my area around the plate i dont want anyone messing with my dirt
432653 its a yankee world were just falling apart in it
432654 i think it is too little too late for the yankees to make the playoffs
432655 no me toques los cojones que te meto un rayo por el culo
432656 there is no reason why with such a young squad why we will be less good this year
432657 we have lost flamini hleb and gilberto but we have replaced hleb with samir nasri who is a very good player gilberto only played 12 games last year
432658 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father hes my boss so whatever he tells me ill do it
432659 when i was on holiday i didnt know what was happening about his future when i came back i realised what was happening but you know the thing has happened already so now the most important thing is behind me and ill show everyone this club has given me a lot of things it gave me a chance to be who i am today so i have to thank them and i think the boss understands that as well so now we are in the same boat now we have to work hard together as a family and to deliver better than what we did last season
432660 there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players they let us do the work and develop the players and then they think they can just come in and offer him big wages
432661 i told you our players were destabilised at the end of the season during an important part of last season not only directly by the club you know how it works it goes through agents its a problem we had i have no special problem with real madrid but the rules are quite clear if you want a player you call the club and ask how much they want for him and if they are ready to sell him if its no you dont need to speak to the player because no is no
432662 if we can do one more signing we will do it but it will need to be quality we dont need money to buy someone but its not just about buying it has to be the right person that is at the moment very difficult we have enough young players who can step in but we lost experience and if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it
432663 if he rode past on his bike if he saw me working in the garden he would stop and say hi
432664 scott told me that a lot of teenagers go down there but i didnt know anything about that
432665 i was trying to act as calm as i could
432666 i didnt want to try to run away who knows what he would have done if i did
432667 they wanted me to describe what this guy looked like
432668 up until wednesday night he seemed like a normal nice guy
432669 my friend had to work otherwise we would have still been there
432670 so i dont really mind where i live this is warm in comparison to lapland
432671 when i arrived at spurs three years ago i had a good feeling about how the club wanted to push on and i get that same feeling here now so im up for the challenge the momentum is starting to build
432672 i was played out of position at left back or right back id never played there before
432673 the players who had played under martin jol suddenly didnt play any more so there was a feeling that something was going to happen
432674 when youve had two fifth places to finish 11th is not what the club wanted and it was a disappointing season of course we won the carling cup but the club really wanted to be in the champions league
432675 he is not at the end of his career he is in the middle of his career and i believe it is a good opportunity for him to show his quality
432676 i remember when i started now i look at the people who were around me then and there are not many who have survived because you go through difficult periods but the strong ones survive so he is at the period where he will show that he can bounce back and show his quality
432677 yes you become a different person out of your country it makes you a different person and it makes you stronger as well
432678 its unfair criticism but unfair criticism stops quickly if you get good results
432679 i think that kind of opinion changes quickly it the euro 2008 qualifying debacle was a big disappointment in the country then he got a lot of hard criticism in england and some managers have problems recovering from that i have seen many national team managers who struggled after because mentally it is quite hard to take
432680 it will be important for us to be at the top of our concentration to go through
432681 we are playing the first game away from home we know we are a wanted target and we want to go to the first game with a top level concentration
432682 of course when you go to holland you get a game its a football country the clubs are always well organised
432683 its amazing and says a lot about the lad and his determination to come back after such a long lay off
432684 he must have been gutted missing out on last seasons successes
432685 but i was pleased because he still played his part he was always in with the players encouraging and got involved with everyone around the team he was a terrific influence even though he wasnt playing matches
432686 the doctors thought i had a heart problem it is not the case i do not have the illness however it is difficult for me to continue i would have liked to sign with psg but i prefer not to take risks
432687 i talked to my mother who advised me not to continue my family wants me to stop i did not want them to worry
432688 i was not expecting to end my career like this i would have liked to have been the paolo maldini of psg but sadly it will not be possible
432689 i am going to go in there and work as hard as i can learn as much as i can and try and become a better player and help the team in any way i can
432690 he is someone i know could take us to where we want to go
432691 why would i want to leave wigan ive enjoyed every minute and i love the fans
432692 that player wages would consume most of the increase in television revenue with no improvement in profit margins
432693 we appear to be seeing game theory in action a shared will and action individually by all the clubs to limit wages growth would deliver increased profitability for all but the pursuit of on pitch success and the intense competitive desire to gain an edge means clubs continue to invest heavily in their playing squads and bid the market up to the detriment of all clubs finances and the benefit of players and their agents
432694 there arent enough stars to go round supply falls short of demand
432695 the photographer had to be evicted wayne was happy to co operate fully and to give a clear version of the events in which he believes he was blameless
432696 hes a born fighter and gets frustrated in some games
432697 i would rather have a player who showed a bit of heart than just accepted it
432698 if he didnt do that he would be criticised for not caring enough so what do people want
432699 i have to explain to him that he must not do these tackles
432700 ive seen the same thing in training it is normal for him and i told him that but i was worried for the other players
432701 at 22 he was never going to be the finished article
432702 when you sign players at 18 its for the long view
432703 at the ford building i found ferde grofe and three others at three hammond novachords and a hammond organ playing plushy arrangements of old folks at home and so on with arpeggios and sea sick swellings and diminishings they show just what the novachord can do how inhuman its breathless flutes and gutless violins can be
432704 he was such a sweetheart i cannot think of anybody who would not miss him
432705 to anybody who knew him he was that bright bubbly happy guy he was always out for fun i already miss him
432706 second degree murder carries a range of parole ineligibility of between 10 and 25 years for first degree murder its a minimum 25 years
432707 so the actual sentence might not be very different from what it would be for first degree
432708 ive been doing this for 21 years and i can judge the type of people were hiring
432709 he was just a normal guy or so we thought to read about this it just totally gives me shivers ive had shivers just the past couple of hours
432710 she says to me that i dont know where he is he had to leave town it was an emergency
432711 the name of the accused as it is quoted is not found in our current serving records nor does it appear or show up in our past serving cf member records
432712 i was like i hope to god theres another tim mclean
432713 he was a sweetheart he was tiny we all called him tiny tim he picked on me because i was smaller than him but it was all in good fun hed never even hurt a fly he wouldnt even kill an ant if it was crawling up his leg
432714 he was that guy who all the girls said he was their best friend and it was true because he was such a sweetheart you couldnt think of him as anything but a friend i cant think of anyone that didnt like him
432715 theres really nothing to feel other than it shouldnt have been tim he did nothing wrong there was no reason why it should have been tim
432716 psychosis or substance abuse potentially a combination of the two
432717 this is apparently bizarre behaviour no provocation no history between victim and offender so im thinking there was something going on in the offenders mind that led to this attack
432718 it could have been a physical appearance of the victim caused a flashback to some memory what the victim was wearing the music coming out of the headphones there has to have been some particular trigger that led to this kind of an outburst when youve got a perpetrator and a victim who are absolute strangers to each other clearly its not personal because theres no history
432719 we all like to have control over whats going on in our environment and the difficulty is we dont know who the person is that is sitting next to us
432720 again what leads to people being concerned about it is so what am i supposed to do and it appears to be entirely random and so the answer is theres not much you can do
432721 the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
432722 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
432723 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
432724 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up

432727 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
432728 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
432729 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
432730 theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
432731 90 of the decreasing sea ice extent is empirically accounted for by the increasing co2 in the atmosphere
432732 substantially faster ice decreases up to 2050 than predicted by ipcc models
432733 our projections for sea ice extent in 2050 are several million square kilometres lower that the ipcc
432734 decreasing arctic sea ice mirrors increasing co2 on decadal time scale
432735 the extreme record low minimum sea ice extent observed in september 2007 may represent crossing such a threshold towards a new state
432736 on the other hand it may well be merely a temporary excursion due to a conjunction of anomalous conditions
432737 is deze opwarming dan niet te wijten aan natuurlijke oorzaken
432738 as unsettling as it can be it is also intelectually exhilarating and like any good piece of pedagogy whets the apitite for further study

432741 with xdna x rite is giving automakers and their suppliers the appropriate tool to distinguish characteristics of effect paints that cant be detected much less analyzed by other systems
432742 we coined the term xdna to emphasize the fact that each effect paint has a unique three dimensional mathematical model similar to the way that each person has a unique dna structure the exact name for package is dynamic numerical analysis but we figured xdna was a little easier to say
432743 x rite will first market the xdna system with ma98 to the automakers and automotive suppliers in the united states and europe but the package has potential applications in other industries including appliance manufacturing and cosmetics formulation
432744 the xdna system of software with ma98 is available in most languages

432753 die mehrheit der gro en lebensmittelhersteller hat in den vergangenen jahren deutliche fortschritte gemacht was die entwicklung von ges nderen produkten und die bewerbung einer ausgeglicheneren ern hrungsweise betrifft
432754 die marketingpraxis in diesem bereich l st bei mir einen stechenden schmerz in der magengegend aus
432755 aktuelle zahlen aus der kiggs studie belegen dass bergewicht und fettleibigkeit bei kindern und jugendlichen auch in deutschland zunehmend zu einem problem wird demnach waren im jahr 2006 rund 15 prozent der deutschen drei bis 17 j hrigen bergewichtig beziehungsweise adip s
432756 die entwicklungstendenz ist eindeutig die zahl der betroffenen kinder hat sich in den vergangenen zehn bis 20 jahren fast verdoppelt
432757 ein entsprechendes werbeverbot das die vermarktung von s en und stark fetthaltigen produkten an kinder und jugendliche untersagt gibt es in deutschland nicht man setzt in diesem zusammenhang auf die freiwillige selbstkontrolle der wirtschaft
432758 in deutschland gibt es mit in form deutschlands initiative f r gesunde ern hrung und mehr bewegung seit kurzem einen eigenen nationalen aktionsplan f r ern hrung und bewegung mit dem man sich auch dem problem des bergewichts und der fettleibigkeit annehmen will
432759 die bundesregierung f rdert im zuge des aktionsplans zum beispiel modellhaft pr ventionsprojekte in deren rahmen rund 500 ma nahmen zur vorbeugung von bergewicht und fettleibigkeit erprobt werden
432760 das modell der honorarberatung ist am transparentesten wenn es keine konkurrierenden interessen gibt ziehen kunde und berater am selben strang und gewinnen dabei beide denn geht es dem kunden gut geht es auch der bank gut
432761 diesen effekt sieht man h ufig bei neuen innovativen ideen weil man noch keine erfahrung damit hat die kosten einer f lschlichen ablehnung einer innovation sind geringer als jene einer f lschlichen annahme
432762 bei diesem modell ist die beste steuerbarkeit und transparenz gegeben
432763 tausende birmesen sterben j hrlich an malaria und aids die schlimme situation wurde durch den zyklon nargis ende april noch einmal dramatisch versch rft
432764 wir hatten gl ck dass wir bereits seit anfang der 1990er jahre im land waren und somit bereits ab dem zweiten tag sehr umfangreich helfen konnten
432765 ende januar wurden drei unserer mitarbeiter bei gezielten anschl gen get tet
432766 wir konnten nicht mehr verantworten dort weiterhin internationale kr fte einzusetzen
432767 wie lange wir diese hilfe jedoch ohne internationale experten sicherstellen k nnen wei ich nicht
432768 das ist aber kein problem da wir aus dem jahr 2006 noch entsprechende r cklagen hatten
432769 das spendenverhalten der deutschen hat sich wieder gebessert sodass wir mit einem viel besseren ergebnis rechen
432770 durch die online ver ffentlichung der datenbank zum sonderauftrag linz ist es uns erstmals gelungen photographien aus dem archiv des badv in berlin mit den angaben zu den bildern und objekten auf den karteikarten aus dem bundesarchiv zusammen zu f hren

432774 it is a real nice way to stay in touch with my friends and former teammates
432775 bob sweeney the director of development for the boston bruins foundation recently stepped down as president of the alumni association and rick middleton took over and i assumed the vice president position so we work together and it is just a great way to stay in touch
432776 the pmc is my favorite event and i love doing it as part of the bruins team
432777 teammate judy songin and i have gone on four or five good rides that have increased in length we did one on sunday that was 74 miles long
432778 but what we do is train enough just to survive the ride
432779 we have been doing a combination of training and fundraising events
432780 but the harbor cruise will be the last real social event and fundraising event
432781 now hopefully we will rest up for a few days and then head down to sturbridge on friday
432782 when we ride for somebody we will always ride for them
432783 it brings back those feelings in a way because we are all working together in a common goal
432784 especially on the second day when we come across the finish line
432785 we sort of meet outside the finish line because we get stretched out over the course of the day so we wait and pull together and cross the line as a team
432786 don sweeney is a very competitive rider and he has a chance to finish among the top couple of riders
432787 but the rest of us are just trying to get across the finish line
432788 we are just trying to raise money for a very good cause
432789 die nachfrage nach den reisen zwischen london und sydney war derart gro dass wir uns dazu entschlossen haben eine weitere transkontinentale busfahrt anzubieten
432790 unsere kunden kommen aus allen alters und berufsgruppen und reichen vom studenten bis hin zum rentner der lteste mitreisende war ein 77 j hriger pensionist
432791 die kosten liegen also deutlich unter dem was man w hrend einer 18 w chigen reise sonst ausgeben w rde
432792 viele kommen auf dieser einzelreise in mehr l nder der welt als sie bisher in ihrem leben waren
432793 f r 2010 planen wir eine weitere transkontinentale busfahrt anzubieten
432794 es freut uns dass die busfahrt nach sydney derart gut angenommen ist dass sie jetzt bereits etabliert ist
432795 bei unseren reisen geht es nat rlich auch darum teamgeist zu zeigen und mit anzupacken wenn es darum geht ein zelt aufzubauen oder zusammenzupacken
432796 aber daf r macht man eine reise die einem nicht nur an ein ziel bringt sondern einem auch jene gro artigen st dte orte und pl tze sehen l sst die sonst einfach berflogen werden
432797 police accused her of having sex with the boy that many times during an intense weeklong affair she was also accused of plying the boy with alcohol and allowing him to drive her car
432798 i will be for change and ill bring you change
432799 what i dont tolerate and what i believe the constitution doesnt protect is speech designed to provoke hate or violence against groups of people
432800 ill break your fingers so that youll never play guitar again and if i see anymore of these posters down ill kill you
432801 what were doing right now is gathering all the data we possibly can to try to explain it
432802 our situation is similar to a lot of what the drivers are telling you in that the results that we saw on sunday were certainly unexpected
432803 we went in there with a proven tire a known quantity we didnt see anything different in our test data from april to indicate a problem
432804 we saw nothing last friday that was out of the ordinary but obviously saturday afternoon we realized we could have an issue we sat down with nascar saturday afternoon and again sunday morning and we all thought the track would come to us just like it always had and would be fine on race day but that obviously did not happen
432805 my view of it is that ultimately nascar has dedicated goodyear to build the tire that were going to run so that means nascar has some responsibility but ultimately the responsibility rests with goodyear
432806 this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been the issue
432807 realistically that track did something that weve never seen it do before and thats not take rubber
432808 that is somehow different from what we experienced in 06 and 07
432809 the whole combination of that tire the car of tomorrow on that racetrack caused that right rear tire to wear like we had never seen before the fronts were similar to what we had seen in 06 and 07 the wear improved on the front but the rear never got any better
432810 thats a storybook ending right there manny getting traded here and coming up representing the winning run
432811 but brandon made some quality pitches and got the double play hes done his job pretty well all year
432812 i was just trying to see the ball and hit it he made a good pitch and got me out but tomorrows another day
432813 my mechanics have fallen into place over the last three or four games and im able to throw all of my pitches over for strikes now and stay away from the big inning
432814 throwing first pitch strikes i had some easy innings and it allowed me to stay out there
432815 hes got great stuff i mean you can see why theyre pretty excited about him
432816 i think he was throwing a little harder than the gun would suggest he had a real good curveball and it seemed like he could throw it all counts hes definitely something to be excited about
432817 mannys obviously a big bat in their lineup and hopefully he pays dividends for them after we leave
432818 everybody can be pitched to but hes one person that can change a lineup and make hitters around him better if you make a bad pitch which i have against him at times hes going to do what he does best so to give him two singles today including an infield hit im pretty happy with that

432820 wir erwarten uns von dem verlauf des barometers und den stimmungen der befragten r ckschl sse und hinweise darauf woran es derzeit noch hapert und wo wir ansetzen m ssen um eine nachhaltige aktienkultur in deutschland zu etablieren
432821 die tatsache dass das barometer in den vergangenen zwei quartalen trotz weiterer negativschlagzeilen nur moderat gesunken ist deutet auf eine gewisse reife der anleger hin und zeigt dass die j ngsten turbulenzen eine nicht allzu gro e verunsicherung hervorgerufen haben
432822 der schutz von jugendlichen und kindern vor sexuellem missbrauch liegt auch uns am herzen dies ist aber kein besonderes thema in bezug auf lesben und schwule wir begr en dass christoph daum keinen zweifel daran gelassen hat dass dies auch seine haltung ist
432823 wir sind froh dass sich christoph daum so eindeutig und aufrichtig von seinen homophoben aussagen distanziert hat in einem pers nlichen gespr ch konnte er uns glaubhaft darstellen dass seine aussagen in keiner weise homophob gemeint waren
432824 wir danken dem trainer f r seine offenheit respektieren seine entschuldigung und haben uns pers nlich von seiner offenen und toleranten einstellung berzeugt wir freuen uns dass er uns k nftig bei aktionen gegen die diskriminierung von lesben und schwulen im fu ball unterst tzen will
432825 die bernachtung wird sich pro person und nacht auf ungef hr 25 bis 35 euro belaufen
432826 es gibt zwei herbergen auf alten schiffen die im zentrum stockholms vor anker liegen und nun kommt noch der umgebaute jumbojet dazu
432827 wir haben uns das angesehen und uns beim dort ausgestellten lufthansa jumbo ein paar inspirationen f r unser hostel geholt
432828 das hostel soll mehr sein als nur eine blo e unterkunft daher werden wir auch ein kleines museum ber die geschichte der boeing 747 einrichten
432829 wir haben einen gro teil der technik ausgebaut allerdings die steuers ulen und einen teil der cockpiteinrichtung erhalten
432830 f r reisende die nur kurze zeit in stockholm verbringen wollen ist das jumbo hostel ideal
432831 mit gratis shuttlebussen ist der internationale terminal bequem erreichbar zu fu ist man in etwa 15 minuten dort die innenstadt stockholms erreicht man in 20 bis 30 minuten bahnfahrt

432842 we started earlier with a number of new olympic preparation programs that really are built on our learning from turin and our learning from otp
432843 there have been individuals throughout history alex baumann is a great example victor davis is a great example greg joy is a great example lots of people have been that outspoken about wanting to win in the past
432844 i think the biggest problem if there is a problem with speaking out like that is that canadians think its a strong stance
432845 often people say yeah i want to win a medal because they think its bad to say i want to win theres nothing wrong with that thats what competition is all about
432846 we will get the medals that we get and people will prepare with the resources that we have
432847 we can say i only believe in gold im here for gold none of that matters if you prepared properly and you execute properly and your potential is to win you will win it wont depend on whether you said you were going to do your best or promised gold
432848 weve had unfortunately a lot of injuries in the last two years

432866 this agreement is an important first step in bringing india into the international nuclear safeguards regime

432871 im young im new to the national scene obama said
432872 the one thing we know about the team that john mccain has assembled because its a carry over from some of the folks who have worked on the bush campaigns obama said at a press conference at cape canaveral fla
432873 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
432874 i want to talk about how were going to put more money in peoples pockets
432875 beat after a hard week of campaigning and fielded just a few questions
432876 we have some of the biggest challenges that certainly ive seen in my lifetime
432877 confidence that the determinant factor in the election will be voters deciding who has the answers
432878 its not really clear what this is based on if i were presumptuous i wouldnt be working so hard im beat
432879 i think the american people as a whole are watching this this week and saying what does this have to do with me
432880 we get four or five shots in a row assertions by mccain that i would rather lose a war so that i can win a campaign that i am not willing to visit the troops that i somehow am full of myself that im an empty headed celebrity whatever repeated attacks have been launched this week so when i say boy those are kind of silly arguments the press says isnt that being negative
432881 ultimately what i think weve got to do is keep driving home the essential message of this campaign that weve got to change business as usual
432882 this notion that somehow i was playing the race card is ridiculous what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before which is i dont come out of central casting when it comes to what presidential candidates typically look like and it doesnt just have to do with race it has to do with my name it has to do with my biography and my background it has to do with our message of change
432883 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments had nothing to do with race
432884 im young im new to the national scene obama said
432885 let me be clear in no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist obama said
432886 i am absolutely confident that the people in union mo or jacksonville florida or any other town in the country at the end of the day are going to be making the decision based on what is best for their lives
432887 what i was saying was we cant drill our way out of the problem
432888 what that means is if we want to have true oil independence true energy independence then were going to have to become more efficient obama said
432889 what i said was what ive seen so far from a so called gang of 10 energy bill which several senators are promoting has some of the very aggressive elements that he wants to see in an energy plan
432890 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling positions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful as you might expect from a drilling agenda what i dont want is for the bad to be the enemy of the good
432891 speak words of love and let him know you will see him later
432892 i love you dad you are the greatest father i could ever have thank you so much for everything you have given i will see you later
432893 o great spirit i hear the beat of oyour drums as i walk down the path to the great valley of the spirit world i feel your love as you surround me with the loving spirits throughout my life
432894 hey what is your first name we are friends now we should call each other by our first names
432895 i think that when you live and walk with a loved one and you see them do great things like help a stranger to solve a problem or give something of theirs away to someone who needs it the loved one takes on almost a heroic quality and instills in you a sense of pride and purpose for knowing and being associated with that person and when that loved one dies and you remember those heroic deeds from their life that person is transformed into legend and its then that you realize that it wasnt just a person you were walking with but god and that he was walking with you without death that person may have been your brother or sister father or mother or uncle who like you was trying to find their way in life and was trying to do right by their family but in death you see them for who they really were the piece of god that was given to you to show you how much love and laughter there truly is in this world

433205 i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
433206 i am the prime minister but i am not the prime minister i am the head of indias government but i am not the head of indias government
433207 i think we should consider pratibha patil what say all of you
433208 i am indias leader but i am not indias leader
433209 ultrahigh networth individuals are looking forward to buy overseas equities and real estate
433210 i am grateful to the voters i am grateful to the people of india the men and women of india
433211 this is the victory of the principles which our indian people uphold
433212 in the 60th year of our independence for the first time we have a woman president and i want to thank our alliance partners and all those who voted for her
433213 it is a historic win it is a great moment
433214 those who have opposed her have to reconcile her victory
433215 i congratulate pratibha devisingh patil on her election as the president and accept the result in the election with humility
433216 the politics of divisiveness a vote in favour of unity and for strengthening the foundation of our democracy
433217 not surprising as independent lawmakers who want to be on the winning side must have voted for her
433218 the gender appeal was also there with women legislators voting for her
433219 i dont want to sound harsh but the people who were buying million dollar houses with a combined household income of 70 000 or 80 000 were the ones who were chasing easy money
433220 mira m s all y encontrar s lo bello del mundo
433221 i condemn the attack on indian embassy on kabul though pakistan has suffered the most terrorism afflicts sic on countries of our region
433222 it remains the single biggest threat to our stability and to our progress
433223 it is time we all realize that the pursuit of narrow geo political interests and the use of militant radicalism as an instrument of policy can not succeed or serve any long term purpose
433224 of all the manny moments in boston the last ranks as one of the most confounding
433225 for the sox the source said ram rezs pledge of good behavior only served as a tacit admission that his disruptive conduct of the last couple of weeks had been calculated and they had had good cause to suspect more was in the offing if they did not trade him the sox told him thanks but no thanks what was done was done and pack plenty of sunscreen
433226 the good thing about bud is that hes not living in the past hes living in the future
433227 but hed rather that future be on the bank of a river fishing he doesnt have all the ambition in the world hes not what i would call a pta dad
433228 i wasnt trying to anticipate an election year i just simply saw it as a film that makes that journey and does that special thing that i think movies can do once in awhile you begin to feel something that you didnt think was possible when you went in
433229 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
433230 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

433232 huge fridges burst with snacks and drinks bowls of strawberries and muffins lie around the rest area
433233 the company pays for a personal trainer and gym membership for everyone a doctor calls round each friday after the weekly barbeque to see if everyones in good health employees drift in an out at times that suit themselves
433234 when i observed this strawberry and muffin behaviour first i was appalled and took my ceo friend aside
433235 this was disastrous his company would never succeed if he wasted money like this and didnt crack the whip he laughed this is the way it works out here you have to be nice to people
433236 mereka adalah orang orang yang allah beri petunjuk maka ikutilah jejak hidayah mereka

433239 little drummer in her chest further emphasises the nervousness too
433240 her hair grew like weeds through the crevices of my heart
433241 her eyes slowly moved from side to side before she caught a patch of cloudy sky to settle upon
433242 like a small bird with feathers the color a eucalytptus leaf grey tufts like a small path to its beady eyes
433243 the dense scrawl settled like angry red ants in her heart
433244 given his central involvement in both major story lines obama was the top newsmaker from april 14 20
433245 he was a significant or dominant factor in 76 of the campaign stories a large leap from the previous week when he registered at 46 clinton at 59 trailed obama but even that was up a bit from her 56 total a week earlier
433246 after watching his media coverage climb recently gop candidate john mccain fell back to 24 last week a drop of 11 points from the week before all told the democrats generated almost six times as many stories as the republicans last week
433247 you didnt say in that notable death listing that on president roosevelt died he was one of the most important men in history and you ignored him those of us who remember him want to know why you ignored him
433248 and the day he died it was horrible hearts were broken everywhere
433249 i cant believe it right on the front page of todays s t is the article with picture of a black preacher a friend of jeremiah wright who may resurrect the naacp and if this isnt enough the article continues on half of the second page i cant believe that the editors of the s t believes this article is of such news worthiness that it should occupy this much printers ink or that they would think that the majority of s t readers would consider it a top news story
433250 its misspelled in the headline and throughout the story thats just disgusting dont you have fulltime people to check spelling i want an explanation
433251 the book reads like an adolescent fantasy about manhood and priesthood priests represent jesus its salvation through titillation women are portrayed as shallow a mindless mass of bodily desires who fall all over jesus like brad pitt groupies
433252 if we accept that martha and mary were both teenagers the squabbling between them becomes understandable it is also not unlikely that they both had crushes on him
433253 i dont think thats fair were not asking him to fill those shoes specifically were asking him to be a contributing member of a winning baseball team
433254 if that ball couldve snuck out for me it wouldve been better
433255 i wouldve like to have done it in nine innings because its been a long day but it doesnt matter really
433256 it definitely ranks up there as one of the better moments ive had
433257 i think he had a pretty good heartbeat going anyway
433258 this place continues to amaze me the way the fans welcomed him you only see that here
433259 the trade will take care of itself through time but we still have other parts that we have to solidify we have to pitch the ball well and play good defense as we do that itll give our offense a chance to get going

433262 fight against those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth from among the people of the book jews and christians until they pay the jizya tax payed by non muslims with willing submission and feel themselves subdued
433263 make war on them until idolatry shall cease and allahs religion shall reign supreme
433264 fight in allahs cause and rouse the believers it may be that allah will restrain the fury of the unbelievers they only wish you would reject the faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they so do not take friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of allah from what is forbidden but if they turn renegades seize them and slay them

433279 both the leaders would also discuss the ways to further strengthen bilateral relations as well as regional and global issues
433280 neither does the 123 agreement with the us provide any such fuel supply guarantee nor can the iaea ensure uninterrupted fuel supply since it is a monitoring agency
433281 thus the provisions of the hyde act and not the assurances made by the indian prime minister in parliament are shaping the course of the indo us nuclear deal through the various stages
433282 therefore the safeguards agreement can only be terminated under the standard termination conditions contained in articles 29 and 32 of the agreement implying that nuclear facilities can be withdrawn from safeguards only after these facilities are no longer usable for any nuclear activity
433283 as with other safeguards agreements between the agency and member states the indian agreement is of indefinite duration
433284 there are no conditions for the discontinuation of safeguards other than those provided by the safeguards agreement itself the termination provisions contained in the agreement are the same as for other 66 type agreements

433300 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
433301 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
433302 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
433303 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
433304 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
433305 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
433306 at the moment we are moving 70 000 tons annually from dar es salaam to the copper belt zambia using the tazara line
433307 at present we are studying the possibility of moving 2 300 000 tons of cargo down from the copper belt to the port at dar on an annual basis that would require us to purchase our own train s
433308 the one way distance is about 2 000km due to fuel price increases transport from dar has risen to the level of us100 per ton rates on other routes have increased even more
433309 we are port operators and do not have serious problems in increasing volumes in the port

433331 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
433332 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
433333 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
433334 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
433335 public imagination has been sparked by researchers such as aubrey de grey the british scientist who claims that aging is an
433336 its easy to say that aging is an engineering problem but were pretty elaborate pieces of engineering
433337 proper diet hormone regulation and low stress levels will keep you looking and feeling your best
433338 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
433339 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
433340 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
433341 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
433342 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
433343 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
433344 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
433345 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
433346 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
433347 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
433348 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
433349 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
433350 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

433352 im reading a course by bernie schaeffer is it a waste of time
433353 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
433354 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
433355 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
433356 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
433357 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
433358 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
433359 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
433360 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
433361 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
433362 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
433363 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
433364 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
433365 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
433366 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
433367 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
433368 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
433369 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
433370 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
433371 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
433372 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
433373 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
433374 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
433375 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
433376 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
433377 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
433378 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
433379 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

433383 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
433384 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
433385 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
433386 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
433387 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
433388 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
433389 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
433390 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
433391 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
433392 i unplug the toaster oven and plug in the car
433393 its not a vehicle to replace a car that you take out on the highway commers said
433394 our zenn is a sturdy standard car and not some three wheeled thing
433395 its small super cute and i knew my wife would love it my wife works at the college of st catherine and she drives it every day it has front wheel drive a heater and it works well in the winter i think it has more ground clearance than our 1996 mitsubishi
433396 we did it for environmental reasons but it also will pay off compared with buying another new or used car
433397 i drive 5 miles to work and ill top off the battery there
433398 its been wonderful we got it in december and drive about 700 miles a month we spend about 20 a month on electricity
433399 the car always goes regardless of the cold they just dont go as far on a charge but the front wheel drive is excellent and the traction is good
433400 this zenn fits 80 percent of the trips of most urban dwellers who drive less than 30 miles per day
433401 books have to be read worst luck for it takes a long time it is the only way of discovering what they contain

433404 i worked two jobs at the mall of america last school year
433405 ive also worked as an intern at wells fargo bank and this is my second summer as an intern at ameriprise financial you can meet a lot of people in business and work comes naturally to me
433406 i like technology and learning and i dont need a lot of downtime
433407 they are smart people but one day i want my kids to have a normal life and i just always knew i was going to college major in business minor in music

433409 she is financially responsible angela is just a very mature bright and resilient young woman
433410 i try to meet someone new every day ive met lots of people who started in this job and now they are in that job you can grow your career here i could end up here after college
433411 last summer angela worked in an operations job that supports the business and this summer shes getting more exposure to the finance function and an actual business
433412 shes interested in finance and she definitely has the desire for a career in business were excited to have her
433413 we got to go out to dinner and see the city

433416 he just needs to learn how to pitch like jamie moyer
433417 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
433418 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
433419 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
433420 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

433424 we help build skills confidence improve attitudes in some cases and help them reach career objectives
433425 its not just a job we stay in touch with these people and their employers for at least 18 months
433426 we promote internally within north memorial and some of these individuals have moved up with us and a few have left for other opportunities were very satisfied
433427 i dont feel so much on my own ive got a feeling that theres a great job right ahead
433428 but overall everything about the stock market is negative lately
433429 i sat with my student managers last week and were sitting on cash they dont want to invest all the news is bad they say
433430 the reality is there are certain companies that are down that are good this country this economy is not going to roll over and die we are an innovative people with innovative companies everybody is downtrodden im not sure weve seen the worst but were close
433431 we believe were in a recession that really started last november things look awful now but stocks should bottom out pretty soon
433432 stocks will recover sharply and you could see a run of 10 percent by the end of this year that carries through into 2009
433433 there is still some expectation in some quarters that the economy is not as bad as we think it is we see a couple pretty good quarters coming and then a recession in 2009
433434 for a small company of 50 million or less in market capitalization sarbanes oxley is another 1 million in expenses and the investors would rather they spend it on the business
433435 moreover theres a big public misconception in northern minnesota that all these foreigners are coming in they are minnesota companies as far as operations go the people and assets are here about 70 percent of all the mining and energy exploration firms are on the toronto exchange
433436 we talked about private placement or a public offering before going public last year
433437 sarbanes oxley compliance would cost up to 800 000 for us the level of liability for officers directors accounting and legal firms is elevated and its an administrative burden
433438 we went public through black mont capital of toronto the due diligence was more than for a private company but the cost of listing and related compliance is only about 100 000 a year for us we did three meetings and raised 4 million we are a u s based company but we had to incorporate in canada its been a positive experience and we have liquidity for our stockholders
433439 the regulatory framework of the toronto exchanges is really sized to the size of the company and proportionate regulation
433440 we require what is essential and necessary we require ceo and cfo certification of the financials but we dont require outside auditor attestation on internal controls the u s law is very prescriptive in canada corporate governance speaks to the principals of disclosure
433441 we have right size proportionate size regulations the pink sheets and over the counter markets in the u s have none it goes from pink sheets to nasdaq we are an alternative for a growth company looking for an alternative to private financing
433442 what matters most is how well you walk trough the fire
433443 to understand how a searchmonkey app affects user metrics we generally expose a small percentage of our users to a default on experience and measure if and how it changes their usage
433444 hey where do you see yourself in 10 years time you have to know what you want you know
433445 to the extent that weve got issues in our economy its like a storm or a squall line
433446 but were focused on real long term market factors we think this personal jet will expand the market it will be the slowest lowest jet it will be an airplane that small to medium sized businesses can afford if everything works out we think we will have a base price of around 1 million and by business aviation standards it will be really cheap to fly
433447 the jet serves as a smarter simpler and more efficient way to use transportation dollars
433448 it will improve management productivity its going to be used for flights such as duluth to omaha or minneapolis to suburban chicago
433449 when i was a consulting economist the thing that turned me on was not necessarily how can i help someone who has a lot of money make more
433450 this job is my chance to analyze what can most economically change peoples lives
433451 we can analyze if programs work and if they are worth it we can help policymakers set priorities
433452 we want to raise the understanding that these techniques can be applied broadly and the benefits to society can be quantified
433453 all we have is negative news about the mortgage market the capitalization of the big banks and the dire energy situation theres a lot of gloom and doom out there
433454 for the most part were in a tough period thats going to drag on for a while
433455 i dont think we will have a quick snap back this economy was built on cheap energy and theres a wrenching readjustment taking place
433456 i dont know if this is the final capitulation or just more of the same headwinds
433457 the s amp p 500 is down 23 percent historically it takes a year to come out of a bear market i wouldnt be surprised to see a tug of war in the market for the rest of the year
433458 right now it pays to have more cash than less in the portfolio and were more defensive in nature we dont like the financials or consumer stocks right now but we know that somewhere down the line were going to have to get back into financials because when those companies pop theyre going up 20 or 30 percent
433459 think of those points as a wave down the nicollet mall
433460 it allows you to do many things with it and yet its an old fashioned process we just brought it back
433461 it has real chunks of black licorice candy in it
433462 tell the young kid to find an older person who knows how to make it and then ring it up as an old fashioned
433463 real soda fountain with real soda fountain stools and you order from about 20 flavors of malts milk shakes and sodas
433464 this is a family oriented community and people live here all their lives
433465 lets give a welcome to macaca here welcome to america and the real world of virginia
433466 fifteen or 20 years ago if a candidate had made some insensitive statements i dont know if the voters would have held that against him
433467 but they do now because they recognize that were a big and diverse state and were going to get more diverse and thats a good not a bad thing
433468 i think to the outside world virginia is somehow this quiet verdant rural backwater
433469 what do you expect from the rest of a state where there is a serious lack of diversity in every sense of the word
433470 we were raised with things that are really really important family and faith and freedom and football and the most important institution in society is family
433471 that makes me a little nervous there seems to be a transition toward more liberal values in virginia so were going to have to fight it
433472 while academic success is measured by individual achievements the professional world requires learning to work with others effectively
433473 emotions are contagious and leaders have a primal ability to help others stay in their best emotional state
433474 i feel rude eating in front of people who are fasting
433475 i would prefer to take this home to be more respectful
433476 most teachers teaching history today or physics for example dont know what theyre teaching
433477 because of wirths vision and the commitment by many board members and superintendents since then approximately 99 percent of city residents live within six blocks of a park
433478 it makes no more sense to declare a war on terrorism than it does to declare war on another military technique like precision guided missiles
433479 a lethal mix of disaffected individuals an enabling society and a legitimizing political or religious ideology
433480 there have been christian jewish hindu atheist and secular terrorists
433481 military strength is too blunt an instrument to ensure success against terrorism
433482 but instead of worrying about what is hard or soft against terrorism we should exclusively focus on what is effective against terrorism
433483 the best way to defeat the minority of muslims who support terrorist organizations is to engage the majority who do not support them to fight for you
433484 i grew up learning the piano the french horn and the clarinet but i couldnt match v nsk or hara
433485 the little joker the original stained glass window was made by
433486 we put them up there where they can make noise
433487 i am doing a duet in a recital with our daughter
433488 for valadarenses us immigration became the key to social mobility when the brazilian economy was suffering valadares stayed afloat due to remittances sent from immigrants in the us the citys survival depends on us immigration which means now that immigration policy is tightening and the us economy is suffering life in valadares is harder
433489 supposedly 3rd avenue is the avenue of the arts he said
433490 but they are the dreariest most unimaginative things for a street that is to connect with beauty
433491 one would think there would be some winter interest by people including business folks to the plantings
433492 if you want downtown to be the privileged ghetto of those who can afford condos a half million dollars and up then by all means keep residential heights to below 10 stories but if you want downtown to be street lively hosting a variety of activities and retail then either accept that residential towers of well over 10 stories must be built on downtown parcels or get radical and propose a way the government and the private market can cooperate in building truly affordable ownership housing in structures discreetly and modestly low in height

433505 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
433506 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
433507 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
433508 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
433509 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
433510 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

433533 can you learn to save your soul just by reading the bible no because the bible does not have everything god taught
433534 a competent religious guide must be clear and intelligible to all so that everyone may fully understand the true meaning of the instructions it contains is the bible a book intelligible to all far from it it is full of obscurities and difficulties not only for the illiterate but even for the learned
433535 how can you get the true meaning of the bible you can get it only from gods official interpreter the catholic church a catechism for adults p 10
433536 through luther although calvin seems to have been the first to announce monobiblicism clearly the bible became the arm of the protestant revolt a dumb and difficult book was substituted for the living voice of the church in order that each one should be able to make for himself the religion which suited his feelings and the bible open before every literate man and woman to interpret for themselves was the attractive bait to win adherents

433548 they ask is there anything you could do and after researching this a bit we are sending a letter out asking the governor to make sure justice is served because i really believe this verdict is completely outside the guidelines for what happened
433549 the fact that mike is a police officer is immaterial in this case
433550 he was assaulted three times and he took action against the guy who was assaulting him i think the punishment that came down against him was totally inappropriate

433568 democratic presidential candidate barack obama said friday he would be willing to support limited additional offshore oil drilling if thats what it takes to enact a comprehensive policy to foster fuel efficient autos and develop alternate energy sources the illinois senator told a florida newspaper he could get behind a compromise with republicans and oil companies to prevent gridlock over energy
433569 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

433571 everywhere i look i see art and beauty and life and i try in every capacity to make sense of what i see to find god and hope and love in these things or to just understand what the creator of it was trying to convey but more often than not i cant or when i do its not what i thought god and hope and love are rarely the subjects of the art i witness war and lust and death and hopelessness seem to fit the bill a bit better but still i know that in those things exists beauty it has to be in there but doesnt it take an understanding of one extreme to fully appreciate its opposite in some way i think some art has to be abrasive it has to greet you like a grizzly in the middle of the woods afraid and awestruck by its existence and meaning we cant understand the proper way to respond but we know its beautiful in a truly dangerous kind of way art makes us contemplate why and in doing so why we dont understand and through that who we are in relation to it so it makes sense that i want to find god and hope and love in art because it will make me feel a part of those things but i know what art shows me more often is the opposite where i lack those things how badly i want them
433572 the relationship is with the computer it becomes a significant other to them they exhaust emotions that they could experience in the real world on the computer through any number of mechanisms emailing gaming porn

433596 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
433597 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
433598 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
433599 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
433600 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
433601 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
433602 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things

433604 he is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
433605 your conduct serves to increase the risk to him rushdie and to his publisher without the slightest public interest justification i invite you to mitigate the damage you have already done by withdrawing the book and removing the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
433606 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred
433607 i never heard myself called by the name scruffy in nine years
433608 i tried to tell him that having us around hadnt put scruffy off his stroke in the past
433609 i dont even want to justify that with a response the police always had enormous respect for my privacy they understood it was very difficult for me to live in a house with four strangers it is an obscenity to suggest that i asked people to leave the room so that i could have sex with my girlfriend i will not have that said about me
433610 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
433611 consistently acting in favour of developing peaceful cooperation with india we welcome the decision of this country to put its nuclear fuel and facilities in the civilian nuclear sector under iaea supervision and safeguards

433635 i appeal again to the iranian side no longer to play for time but to give us a usable answer to our offers stop dallying

433637 we would then have to further increase pressure via sanctions

433644 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

433695 doc i dont know who you are but you write some really good shit
433696 in the 10 years that ive been here ive never seen this much parvovirus
433697 people dont seem to understand that they need a series of vaccinations in order to protect their pets
433698 we advise people to have their dogs vaccinated by a veterinarian
433699 vaccines are temperature sensitive so purchasing them yourself is often not a good idea
433700 when you compare treatment to the vaccination series which is around a 100 its just much more economical to get the vaccinations
433701 if your dog is showing signs of parvo the depression vomiting and foul smelling diarrhea get them into a veterinarian right away dont wait
433702 were seeing a few cases but not an alarming number maybe one or two a week
433703 almost all the puppies that weve seen with parvo are unvaccinated and have questionable backgrounds
433704 its not so much how many vaccinations a puppy receives but when theyre given
433705 we start vaccinating puppies as early as six weeks old and re vaccinate every three weeks until theyre 15 or 16 weeks old
433706 we generally see an increase in parvovirus every year during the rainy season
433707 but for the past month weve been seeing an exceptional number between five and 10 parvo cases every week
433708 it can live in the soil in the park the yard and in carpet
433709 when we walk through an area where the virus is in the soil we track it on our shoes
433710 we recommend that puppies be restricted from public areas where there are a lot of dogs until their vaccination series is completed
433711 symptoms are vomiting and a very foul smelling bloody diarrhea
433712 without treatment these puppies will die from the fluid loss and dehydration and bacterial infection
433713 our primary concern is to get the word out to all dog owners
433714 its really critical to get your dogs and puppies vaccinated dont wait until their sick
433715 where the wide open mountainous views were all around us
433716 good exercise a healthy diet talking to other people taking time off like a small vacation it doesnt have to be an expensive vacation just go out and visit other people
433717 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
433718 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
433719 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
433720 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
433721 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor

433726 the suicide is pretty convincing evidence that it was him
433727 but this is good enough for government work its better government work than i had expected at this point
433728 i often wondered what was going and why there were no answers
433729 i just hope they find the real answers and settle this once and for all
433730 i dont think it ever really left the scene here not completely
433731 when people think of senior living they think as you get older you cant do anything
433732 the quality of life declines but life shouldnt stop because you get past age 55 75 or 80
433733 you just have to be your own voice and sing your own songs
433734 it definitely ranks up there with one of the better moments ive had
433735 i realize it now that im a board member looking at the company through this little hole once a quarter at a four hour meeting board members dont know that much about the company they really dont i wouldve been much more engaged with the board i didnt have time to update the board on everything if you dont somebody else will you have to be able to give them an accurate picture of whats going on or they develop their own perceptions and start creating their own stories and then they make their decisions how do you keep these people up to date and give them the whole picture
433736 i go back and the big thing was people i didnt move fast enough on some people
433737 my worst decision was not investing earlier in international the international markets dont have as quick returns as the u s but if id known the u s economy was going to crash i would have invested earlier
433738 things get tougher rather than better and so doubts start to grow
433739 unfortunately our scores are not very good if a store got the same score we would consider it underperforming and we would be flipping out
433740 tell her i am sorry i did not know what i was doing
433741 the best method i could think of was putting her inside the suitcase
433742 i took them in order to send to a brazilian in england who she stole money from he said he was going to kill her
433743 i was going to send them by email to show him that although he didnt have the courage to do it someone here did
433744 ill never recover from this my baby is in bits they cant even find her i need her back i just want to get my baby back where she belongs
433745 that monster has taken my girl he took her life and i want his she wasnt an angel but she didnt deserve that
433746 a roadside bomb exploded under a minibus carrying a bride and groom
433747 in summary i highly recommend the worth 3dx to anyone who is prepared to shell out serious money for a baseball bat although the 3dx costs a little more than other high end sr league bats bats it outperforms the other bats on the market has a big sweet spot and holds up very well for a thin walled high end bat

433750 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
433751 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
433752 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
433753 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
433754 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
433755 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
433756 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
433757 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
433758 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
433759 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

433790 they know that as taxpayers we support the government not the opposite
433791 human rights has become more than just a theory for the public
433792 in the past they petitioned and complained about injustice but that wasnt about defending their rights they let the higher authorities to decide their rights
433793 what they are asking for now is a change in the system and this reflects a widespread change in attitude
433794 i saw a gap between the official story and the reality which was mind blowing like the presence of the armed police
433795 so i put some of these things on the internet on my personal blog
433796 the media has made a huge step forward from the 80s
433797 would have been impossible for the public to know about in the past
433798 today even the farmers in remote areas have satellite tvs
433799 so whenever they see an election such as the one held in pakistan recently they may wonder why even though we have approximately the same economic conditions they can elect their top leaders and we cant even vote for the leader of a small county i think a consciousness of political rights has increased more than anything
433800 there has been progress but its so slow that sometimes one becomes pessimistic

433824 when you have many young players you cannot keep them all
433825 the most important thing is that you develop them as a player and they have a big career
433826 at some stage you have to consider the quality of the player and what is in front of him
433827 at the time the players in front of bentley like ljungberg and pires were better than him
433828 he wanted to play more central in the dennis bergkamp role and i felt at the time he was not ready he would be more ready today
433829 there comes a moment when a player has to play to develop when you feel that you have to make a decision to let him go or keep him
433830 the fact that bentley is now a national team player proves it was the right decision
433831 we deserve praise because we were not stupid and keep the player in the reserves
433832 at youth level you are working 90 for other clubs some players who are just a little bit short for you go somewhere else but you have an influence on their development
433833 when you have an academy of our quality not every player can make it
433834 ich war mit meiner runde nicht 100 prozentig gl cklich denn im dritten qualifying durchgang ging ich zur falschen zeit auf die strecke es waren so viele langsamere autos auf ihrer runde aus der box unterwegs ich m chte gern voll fahren und der schnellste sein aber man kann sie nicht berholen es ist aus diesem grund schwierig die reifen vorzubereiten
433835 ich konnte die reifen nicht so vorbereiten wie ich dies tun wollte ich konnte keine so gro artige runde fahren wie im ersten oder zweiten qualifying durchgang
433836 manchmal ist das was man sieht nicht wirklich die realit t manchmal montieren sie gro e teile an das auto und man kann das sehr deutlich sehen aber manchmal sind es kleine teile die das auto in bezug auf den abtrieb effizienter machen
433837 das ist bei der entwicklung so das auto funktioniert nun ein wenig besser aber von heute auf morgen wird es sich nicht um eine halbe sekunde verbessern so funktioniert das nicht wir machen sehr viel druck und ich bin mir sicher dass wir von diesem rennen an bis zum ende der saison noch mehr druck machen werden
433838 im gonna get up in the mornin i believe ill dust my broom
433839 in the last two games we have created several chances but either the opposition keeper has played really well to stop us from scoring or we have just missed the target
433840 there is no problem i am sure the goals will come and the important thing is that the players are creating chances
433841 when they have more sharpness they will score more goals at this stage it is all about preparing for the start of the season and i know that when the season begins my players will be ready
433842 last season fernando torres steven gerrard ryan babel dirk kuyt yossi benayoun and peter crouch all got double figures for us so i know we have the players to score goals
433843 i thought i was gonna see one of the best pitchers in baseball but all i saw was a fat guy
433844 never could admit that im a better ballplayer than he was
433845 even though he only pitched five innings that was a quality performance by a quality pitcher

433856 he again is another guy that is a bit short of match fitness but we have had him for a couple of days he is certainly not short of confidence though
433857 i have sat with tyrone and i have said to him that we would like a longer look at him so we would extend the period for him to stay at the football club
433858 he has got the weekend to chat to his parents and discuss it with them and then well discuss where he feels he is at

433877 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it

433934 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
433935 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid

433939 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
433940 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
433941 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
433942 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
433943 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
433944 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us

433956 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
433957 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
433958 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
433959 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
433960 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
433961 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
433962 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
433963 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
433964 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
433965 i dont like that i just want it without giving any money
433966 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
433967 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
433968 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
433969 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
433970 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
433971 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
433972 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
433973 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
433974 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
433975 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
433976 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
433977 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
433978 being on the mountaintop is so very beautiful but look at what you miss in the valley
433979 father god please help me to keep in mind that my struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spriritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms eph

433987 move over cant you see this is an empty lane
433988 oh some crane thing they are installing a crane or something
433989 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
433990 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
433991 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
433992 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
433993 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
433994 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
433995 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
433996 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
433997 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
433998 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
433999 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
434000 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
434001 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
434002 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
434003 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
434004 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
434005 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
434006 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
434007 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
434008 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
434009 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
434010 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
434011 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
434012 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
434013 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
434014 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
434015 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
434016 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
434017 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
434018 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
434019 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
434020 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
434021 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
434022 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
434023 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
434024 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
434025 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
434026 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
434027 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
434028 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
434029 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
434030 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
434031 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
434032 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
434033 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
434034 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
434035 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
434036 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
434037 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
434038 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
434039 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
434040 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
434041 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
434042 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
434043 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
434044 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
434045 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
434046 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
434047 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
434048 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
434049 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
434050 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
434051 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
434052 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
434053 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
434054 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
434055 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
434056 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
434057 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
434058 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
434059 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
434060 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
434061 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
434062 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
434063 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
434064 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
434065 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
434066 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
434067 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
434068 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
434069 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
434070 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
434071 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
434072 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
434073 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
434074 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
434075 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
434076 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
434077 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
434078 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
434079 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
434080 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
434081 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
434082 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
434083 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
434084 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
434085 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
434086 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
434087 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
434088 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
434089 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
434090 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
434091 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
434092 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
434093 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
434094 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
434095 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
434096 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
434097 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
434098 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
434099 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
434100 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
434101 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
434102 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
434103 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
434104 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
434105 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
434106 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
434107 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
434108 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
434109 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
434110 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
434111 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
434112 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
434113 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
434114 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
434115 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
434116 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
434117 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
434118 yes this is it this is the end of us
434119 you know it is very hard for me to say goodbye

434122 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
434123 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
434124 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
434125 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
434126 if the vice president says its do able i believe
434127 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
434128 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
434129 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
434130 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
434131 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
434132 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
434133 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
434134 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
434135 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
434136 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
434137 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
434138 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
434139 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
434140 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
434141 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
434142 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
434143 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
434144 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
434145 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
434146 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
434147 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
434148 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
434149 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
434150 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
434151 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
434152 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
434153 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
434154 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
434155 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
434156 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
434157 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
434158 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
434159 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
434160 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
434161 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
434162 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
434163 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
434164 enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
434165 thus what gore offered july 17 was not so much a
434166 of course the greatest obstacle to meeting the challenge may be the deep dysfunction of our politics and our self governing system as it exists today in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
434167 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
434168 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
434169 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
434170 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
434171 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
434172 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
434173 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
434174 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
434175 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
434176 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
434177 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
434178 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
434179 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
434180 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
434181 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
434182 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
434183 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
434184 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
434185 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
434186 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
434187 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
434188 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
434189 once i got out of that and i could move a little bit nothing was better than that even if i couldnt pitch
434190 once i got out of that and i could move a little bit nothing was better than that even if i couldnt pitch
434191 once i got out of that and i could move a little bit nothing was better than that even if i couldnt pitch
434192 if people can find jesus somehow in each of us like shes found in this object that would be a wonderful thing
434193 do not touch the system anymore amp not even any single data about the employees
434194 what if i am gonna transfer you to another department not connected to him
434195 ive learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel
434196 i cant change the direction of the wind but i can adjust my sails to always reach my destination
434197 its not always rainbows and butterflies its compromise that moves us along
434198 there are three things that are never satisfied yea four things say not it is enough
434199 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
434200 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
434201 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
434202 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
434203 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
434204 a curse unto his kin and unto all that harbor him
434205 each of us must await the end of life in this world let him who may gain glory before death that shall afterwards be best for the warrior
434206 it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife
434207 what a fine thing for our girls it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them
434208 elizabeth is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me
434209 that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have much such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh
434210 has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke
434211 there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without
434212 perhaps that is not possible for anyone but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule
434213 yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is real superiority of mind pride will always be under good regulation
434214 dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail the legal provision by which he is to inherit longbourn of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch
434215 no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse
434216 a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility
434217 i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish
434218 a fortunate chance had recommended him mr collins to lady catherine de bourgh and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility
434219 a good vocabulary is not acquired by reading books written according to some notion of the vocabulary of ones age group it comes by reading books above one
434220 happier days are definitely ahead for you struggle has ended
434221 if i could start again a million miles away i would keep myself i would find a way
434222 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
434223 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
434224 john mccain could have been clearer in the interview in stating that his position on gay adoption is that it is a state issue just as he made it clear in the interview that marriage is a state issue
434225 he recognizes that there are many abandoned children who have yet to find homes john mccain believes that in those situations that caring parental figures are better for the child than the alternative
434226 in one method a republican party fund aimed at electing governors has started marketing itself as a home for contributions of unlimited size to help sen mccain
434227 in another republican strategy the mccain campaign itself last month began soliciting its biggest donations yet up to 70 100 per check the technique is to establish a joint fund raising account that brings together the legal maximum gifts for the candidate the national party and four state parties with contests pivotal to the outcome the combined maximum is the most that any presidential candidate has solicited since the 2002 mccain feingold reforms the campaign raised 3 million for the fund in a matter of days during a string of fund raisers last month
434228 it is not the role of this court to pronounce the second amendment extinct
434229 contributions to john mccain 2008 and the john mccain 2008 general election compliance fund are not deductible as charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes in accordance with federal limits a contribution is designated first for john mccain 2008 with the contributions balance designated for the compliance fund for contributions to john mccain 2008 primary election account an individual may give up to 2 300 a couple may give up to 4 600 and a federal multi candidate pac may give up to 5 000 for contributions to the compliance fund an individual may give up to 2 300 a couple may give up to 4 600 and a federal multi candidate pac may give up to 5 000 contributions to the compliance fund will be used solely for legal and accounting services to ensure compliance with federal law including a portion of the cost of broadcast advertising campaign offices and computer website expenses federal law prohibits compliance fund contributions from being used for a candidates election contributions from corporations unions government contractors national banks and foreign nationals without permanent residency status are prohibited federal law requires us to report the name address occupation and employer of any contributor who gives more than 200 in an election cycle

434231 in a series of experiments and field studies university of minnesota psychologist kathleen vohs and colleagues repeatedly
434232 these gaps in the theory are perhaps not very serious in the absence of any alternative explanation of greene et al
434233 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
434234 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
434235 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
434236 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
434237 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
434238 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
434239 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

434248 we expect inflation to stay above 5 largely due to high global oil prices
434249 the appropriated funds do not allow the department of energy to address several critical needs which if left unresolved much longer will place our nations innovation and competitiveness at great risk

434267 we all come to church because god is using pastor alton to address our particular situations its phenomenal
434268 some parents need to get a lasso around their college age children and fast before they do some real damage
434269 we felt that if god was merciful enough to speak prophetically through our pastor like that we should take action
434270 if they cant make the connection between what im saying and what theyre putting on the internet then maybe god really is speaking to them
434271 and they sure treat me with a lot more respect now

434288 tidak berganjak kaki seseorang hamba sehingga ditanya 4 perkara umurnya dimana dihabiskan ilmunya apa yang dibuat dengannya hartanya dari mana diperolehi dan ke mana dihabiskan dan jasadnya bagaimana digunakan kata al tirmiziy ia adalah hasan sahih
434289 patutkah manusia menyangka bahawa ia akan ditinggalkan terbiar dengan tidak diberikan tanggungjawab dan tidak dihidupkan menerima balasan
434290 adakah engkau ya tuhan kami hendak menjadikan di bumi itu orang yang akan membuat bencana dan menumpahkan darah berbunuh bunuhan padahal kami sentiasa bertasbih dengan memujimu dan mensucikanmu
434291 terangkanlah kepadaku nama benda benda ini semuanya jika kamu golongan yang benar
434292 dia lah yang telah membolehkan manusia bertutur memberi dan menerima kenyataan
434293 dan tidaklah ada keberkatan terhadap rezki yang diperolehi secara haram yang dibelanjakan dan tidak pula diterima sadaqah dari sumber yang haram dan apa yang ditinggalkan untuk warisnya akan menyebabkan menjadi bekalannya ke neraka dan tidaklah boleh digunakan untuk menghapuskan dosa dengannya
434294 apakah kalian akan berucap seperti bani israel kami mendengar tetapi kami tidak memperkenankan
434295 kami dengar dan kami taati ampunilah kami wahai tuhan kami dan kepada engkaulah tempat kembali
434296 kini berakhir sudah huraian ayat ini bagaimana sikap orang orang yang kitab ini diturunkan kepada mereka
434297 kami tidak membeza bezakan antara seseorang pun dengan yang lain dari rasul rasul nya
434298 setiap seorang dari mereka percaya akan adanya allah swt mentauhidkan nya serta tidak menyekutukan allah percaya akan adanya malaikat percaya kepada semua kitab yang diturunkan dari langit yang merupakan wahyu yang masuk meresap ke hati para rasul itu tidak seperti ahli kitab yang percaya kepada setengahnya dan ingkar kepada setengah yang lain
434299 mereka orang yang beriman berkata bahawa rasulullah saw telah menyampaikan ajaran kepada mereka lalu mereka dengar ajaran itu dengan penuh perhatian lalu mereka mentaati perintah dan larangan nya dengan penuh rasa penuh ketundukan dan penyerahan inilah yang mendorong jiwa untuk melakukan perintah allah swt dengan jalan yang sebaik baiknya kecuali dalam keadaan dihalang oleh sesuatu yang tidak dapat dielakkan
434300 mereka bersedia menerima perintah perintah yang disampaikan oleh para rasul dan berikrar mentaatinya tidak menderhakainya oleh sebab itu bersegeralah mereka mengamalkannya kecuali jika dalam keadaan kepayahan atau berhalang
434301 namun orang yang hatinya tulus ikhlas enggan berhenti walaupun kepayahan atau berhalangan tetap bercita cita akan menyempurnakan amalan secukupnya dan jika tidak dapat mereka menganggap dirinya cuai
434302 ampunilah kami ya tuhan kami dan kepada engkaulah tempat kembali
434303 allah telah memulai surah al baqarah ini dengan menyebutkan bahawa al quran itu jangan diragukan kerana ada mengandungi petunjuk bagi orang orang yang bertaqwa
434304 seterusnya dijelaskan pula beberapa hukum hukum agama seperti solat zakat puasa haji talak ila haid jihad dan kisah para nabi dan allah swt telah menghujah kaum terdahulu yang sesat khasnya kaum yahudi
434305 kesudahan dari keimanan itu orang orang mukmin telah dapat menyucikan jiwa dan hati mereka tinggi himmah sehingga mencapai puncak ketinggian yang menakjubkan di dunia
434306 misalnya usaha mereka gilang gemilang dapat membuka beberapa negeri di dunia ini dengan menggunakan siasatan keadilan dan kebijaksanaan yang tidak dapat dimungkiri sekalipun oleh musuh islam sendiri
434307 sejarah telah mencatat bahawa dewasa ini manusia sedang dalam lembah kejahilan dan ditindas pula oleh kerajaan kerajaan besar yang ada pada masa itu
434308 hal itu terjadi kerana ibu memiliki tiga perkara sangat mahal yang tidak dimiliki bapa iaitu mengandung melahirkan dan menyusukan
434309 ibunya mengandungnya dengan susah payah dan melahirkannya dengan susah payah pula mengandungnya sampai menyusuinya adalah tiga puluh bulan
434310 wanita dinikahi kerana empat perkara hartanya kedudukannya kecantikannya dan agamanya pilihlah pemilik agama nescaya kamu beruntung
434311 solat itu tiang agama sesiapa yang mendirikannya sesungguhnya dia sudah mendirikan agama sesiapa meninggalkannya sesungguhnya dia meruntuhkan agama
434312 kemudian apabila kamu selesai mengerjakan solat maka hendaklah kamu menyebut dan mengingati allah semasa kamu berdiri atau duduk dan semasa kamu berbaring kemudian apabila kamu merasa tenteram berada dalam keadaan aman maka dirikanlah solat itu dengan sempurna seperti mana biasa sesungguhnya solat itu adalah satu ketetapan yang diwajibkan ke atas orang beriman yang tertentu waktunya
434313 suruhlah anak kamu menunaikan solat ketika berumur tujuh tahun dan pukul mereka jika meninggalkannya ketika berumur sepuluh tahun dan asingkanlah mereka lelaki dan perempuan dari tempat tidur
434314 wahai tuhanku jadikanlah aku orang yang mendirikan solat dan demikianlah juga zuriat keturunanku wahai tuhan kami perkenankanlah doa permohonanku
434315 sesungguhnya akulah allah tiada tuhan melainkan ku oleh itu sembahlah aku dan dirikanlah solat untuk mengingati ku
434316 solat lima waktu dan solat jumaat hingga jumaat berikutnya adalah penebus dosa antara jarak waktu solat itu selama dijauhinya dosa besar

434319 the well is dry my hands are tied the sky is dark my lovers tongue is sharp the wind is cold looking for truth while i dwell where only lies are told my bed is wet im hungry when there is no food left my window is broken no need for a trojan the floor is burning the ceiling is collapsing my world is shaking my chair is breaking the dragon im chasing skin is flaking the dandruff like mist doesnt allow me to know which direction im facing its like clockwork the day starts just the same as it finished twilight either kills dreams or lets them replenish its like the cycle of life it shows you hope cant die humanities greatest strength also brings its demise why is the question sometimes if its wrongly ingested the only thing you get is indigestion which is an infection from the blinding light that comes from the darkest confessions which at times the worlds greatest sages couldnt retrieve a minor lesson but each persons actions are at their own discretion and will never make complete sense sometimes even to the person in question but why should it curiosity killed kat she should have never walked into the partially open door of that killers flat now shes got twat but sometimes the answer you spend your whole like looking for is nothing but a cadaverous trap or it burn you for the rest of your life like no shots of penicillin after you get the clap

434323 conditions today were tough but actually that was the maximum we could do the target was to do a 1min 21 7 or 21 8 and we did a 21 6 so that was the most we could get out of the car the balance was not too bad but unfortunately the grip level is still very poor i think were not particularly quick round here and we have to accept that but we are still quite close we are to the others
434324 i think we expected to slip back a bit from our closest rivals due to not running the seamless shift and that proved to be the case giancarlo pretty much got the most out of it he could but unfortunately adrian couldnt get a decent lap together so was a way off his optimum time we know our race pace is better than our qualifying pace and although this makes life difficult at this track we have to get two cars to the end and do a professional job

434351 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics

434370 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
434371 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters
434372 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
434373 inter coach jose mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult

434446 today more than half of consumers regardless of income are searching for a bargain
434447 providers like ryanair and easyjet caused a commotion in the european markets by providing limited service at a price that was attractive to the cost conscious consumer
434448 ryanair recorded an operational margin of 25 in the past year compared to the more traditional carriers that had to settle for margins below 10
434449 the consumer has a wider selection and is encouraged to save through consumption
434450 low cost business models could completely rewrite the rules of the effected industries
434451 these optimized offerings create transparency in terms of the actual costs for the individual service components this leads to strong price pressure and to a higher degree of product differentiation
434452 booz allen envisions low cost as a part of a service companys growth strategy
434453 a higher complexity ensues from this several parallel business systems and internal processes must be established furthermore it is important to pursue differentiate marketing strategies and successfully manage the resulting variety of brands smart customization is the name of the game

434461 i wasnt 100 percent happy with my laps in q3
434462 i went out on the track at a little bit of a wrong time when there were too many cars around

434466 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
434467 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
434468 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
434469 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were

434505 the m plan should serve as an inspiration for anc branches currently
434506 we are encouraging them to establish street committees to fight crime in our communities
434507 as the struggle continued waged internally and internationally you represented the undying spirit of a people who would never rest until justice and human dignity were restored
434508 the mandela name became synonymous with our struggle for freedom
434509 during your term as the first president of a free sa you elevated this country from being a pariah to a respected successful modern democracy
434510 you served a very short but highly effective term before handing over to your deputy comrade mbeki in a carefully planned succession strategy
434511 you continued to work tirelessly to make sa a better country and to put a smile on the faces of many

434578 pandemic planning today tends to emphasize mandatory vaccination and forced treatment

434581 the risk of an avian influenza pandemic is still with us

434663 however in the name of olympic security the government of china has intensified security clampdown amounting to stifling of tibetan peoples religious freedom and human rights
434664 any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement

434696 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
434697 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
434698 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
434699 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
434700 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
434701 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
434702 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
434703 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
434704 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses

434992 el partido fue muy duro y no imaginaba que acabar a marcando tres goles la clave de la victoria estuvo en los espacios y la calidad de los centros de leto riise y gerrard

434997 let us not forget that marxism as the one great political force of our twentieth century made its appearance with the claim to be bringing a new world of freedom and of free people this very promise of knowing the scientifically guaranteed way to freedom and of creating the new world drew to it many of the boldest spirits of our age ultimately it even appeared as the force through which the christian teaching of redemption could be transformed into a realistic practical means for liberation as the force that could bring the kingdom of god as the true kingdom of men the collapse of realist socialism in the east european states has not quite laid aside all such hopes and here and there they still subsist silently awaiting some new form

435010 they played a great four games they beat us we got schooled they played a lot better than we did we havent done anything right in four days
435011 we dont like the fact that we allowed their fans to come into our park and have a four day party but thats our fault
435012 thats just pathetic i certainly hope that the word has gone forth to all secretaries that youve got to really ratchet this down its not time to be trying to impress people with rented limousines
435013 were keenly aware of the fact that six months of crime progress can be undermined by a couple of bad days of crime news but i think the city deserves given its investment in us to get some positive news out of us

435018 for a week hes obama been on defense its the first time in a while and he doesnt like it
435019 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
435020 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
435021 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
435022 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
435023 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
435024 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
435025 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
435026 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
435027 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
435028 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president

435049 the team have done a great job in improving our car even from the last weekend and it would be great to get a 1 2 on sunday it would be about time
435050 i wasnt 100 percent happy with my laps in q3
435051 i went out on the track at a little bit of a wrong time when there were too many cars around
435052 that made it really tricky for the preparation of my tyres but i think our lap times from the first two qualifying sessions showed that we are pretty strong
435053 i bet it looks a lot better now than it did at first
435054 most managers have learned to think strategically about their business overall but few think strategically about what they spend most of their time doing communicating argenti 2007
435055 this is the way we work welcome and dont be afraid soon you will love the wiki
435056 we believe that sharing information everywhere possible will help us do a better job and be a lower cost producer
435057 but we came quickly to the conclusion that to do what we wanted in sharepoint it would be a very large expensive and long project
435058 its ease of use and the look and feel were huge attractions we were amazed how quickly we could set up a complete and very effective tool
435059 will come in areas outside it when a person in pennsylvania say connects with someone in alberta and shows him something hes done that saves the company 10 000 or 20 000 or when an informal discussion group is established amongst maintenance workers or kiln operators across borders and geography we expect those things will happen regularly

435061 we also got to use some of sidereans new ajax widgets like the date slider
435062 weve also given users the ability to create a relational navigation view specific to their interests across these various oracle systems then subscribe to it as an rss feed mash up
435063 seamark meant we didnt need to try to be prescient and rebuild navigation that anticipated the needs of an incredibly diverse set of users
435064 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
435065 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
435066 i welcome todays bipartisan effort as an important step in the process of reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil
435067 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

435092 when you have zero aim you have zero work to achieve the goal with your partner and the road taken is going to be so blurry and more devastating when the love pronounced is not more than just a platform for those who really want to oppress his her desire of sexuality

435096 but ngagi gorilla in local dialect was more serious and was always the dominant animal throughout their life in play mbongo was usually the aggressor and showed a surprising agility and skill at handling his big cage mate as they got older
435097 mbongo has become rather sly about getting the lions share of treats by assuming a great interest in some other part of the cage until ngagi becoming fearful that he is missing something wanders over that way when mbongo leads him further away ngagi becomes actually so engrossed in the mystery that he fails to see mbongos stealthy return mbongo silently opens his big red mouth and permits you to stuff your fruit or food into it he shuts it quickly and walks away with the greatest air of unconcern you can imagine chewing most surreptitiously in spite of his suspicions ngagi never quite catches on to what has happened

435122 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in
435123 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work

435130 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it

435176 in dem verfahren gegen mich in d sseldorf ist von meinen bochumer freunden die mich da mit innigster herzlichkeit verfolgen gesagt worden die agenda 2010 von gerhard schr der die ich ja unterst tzt habe und weiterhin unterst tze sei menschenverachtend das kann doch jemand wie ich nicht stehen lassen das kann doch die spd f hrung nicht stehen lassen
435177 wenn es dabei bleibt wird das f r die spd heftige folgen haben dann werden sich die mitgliederverluste beschleunigen
435178 aber wenn man das will in der spd dann m ssen sie auch mich ausschlie en gerhard schr der frank walter steinmeier ulla schmidt also das ganze kabinett

435195 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist
435196 when plaintiffs discovered these images rather than using the simple removal option google affords they sued google for invasion of privacy trespass negligence and conversion plaintiffs seek damages from mental suffering and diminished property value supposedly caused by the public accessibility of the photos they claim these injuries even though similar photos of their home were already publicly available on the internet and even though they drew exponentially greater attention to the images in question by filing and publicizing the lawsuit while choosing not to remove the images of their property from the street view service

435204 they who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

435206 its good news that the amnesty site has been unblocked in the olympics media venues and perhaps elsewhere in beijing but its still a long way from the complete media freedom that was promised
435207 blocking and then unblocking sites for journalists arbitrarily simply doesnt respect basic standards of free speech
435208 chinese people have just as much right to freedoms of expression and information as anyone else yet this right is systematically denied we are calling on the chinese government to bring an end to internet repression in line with their olympic promises

435222 aber wenigstens konnte sich seb nicht von mir absetzen die letzten beiden pr fungen dieses tages muss ich voll konzentriert angehen
435223 ich habe vollgas gegeben und keinen fehler gemacht ich h tte nicht erwartet zeit auf ihn zu verlieren aber vielleicht liegt das daran dass ich die stra e sauber machen musste
435224 das stimmt aber wir haben noch harte pr fungen vor uns einfach wird es nicht

435226 aber ich werde weiter attackieren und alles geben was ich kann
435227 timo ein bisschen haben wir heute schon mit der pole position spekuliert aber auch so hast du einen bmw und einen ferrari hinter dir gelassen hast du damit gerechnet
435228 ich muss sagen ich hatte schon nach dem ersten freien training ein sehr gutes gef hl nach dem zweiten freien training war es ein bisschen anders denn da ging das auto wieder ein bisschen in die richtung in der ich es berhaupt nicht haben will heute morgen haben meine ingenieure dann einen ganz guten job gemacht und das auto in die richtige richtung gebracht ins richtige fenster da hatte ich schon ein gutes gef hl mir war klar dass wir eine gute chance haben in die top 10 zu fahren
435229 wenn das auto so ist wie ich es mir vorstelle dann sieht man was m glich ist
435230 gut genug f r die pole war es nicht aber man sieht wenn das auto so ist wie ich es mir vorstelle dann sieht man was m glich ist das war heute so obwohl ich mir nach q2 ein bisschen mehr ausgerechnet hatte ein bisschen zeit habe ich auf der q3 runde verloren weil robert kubica dreimal vor mir rausgefahren ist und bmw die reifen anscheinend anders anf hrt als wir die waren extrem langsam unterwegs w hrend ich ein bisschen schneller fahren muss um meine reifen auf temperatur zu bringen das hat nicht ganz so geklappt dadurch haben mir die vorderreifen ein bisschen gefehlt im ersten sektor
435231 vielleicht h tte ich noch vor robert schl pfen k nnen aber jetzt m ssen wir mal zufrieden sein mit platz f nf und vor allem die ganzen fragen ob ich meinem team und meinem auto vertraue sind damit beantwortet ich war auch schneller als mein teamkollege unter normalen bedingungen das ist immer gut es hat endlich mal alles so funktioniert wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe

435240 e government has stopped the bleeding for now in terms of citizen satisfaction
435241 but it remains to be seen if this is a blip or the beginning of a positive trend
435242 citizens expectations are formed by their experiences on the web not necessarily their experiences with other government sites so the bar is very very high
435243 you dont want the irs to know who you are if youre looking into what the penalty is for violating a tax code right all of a sudden an auditor shows up at your door
435244 but it has some handcuffs on these government sites i would expect that over time government may readdress the policy you can have cookies that track and still be very anonymous it can be done
435245 in a perfect world you might have a scenario where you have a consistency across government sites that would make it seamless
435246 you would navigate your way through sites not knowing that youre going from one owner to another owner thats very difficult to pull off with something as large as the federal government but the use of sites like usa gov really helps a lot

435251 i think the answer to the security issues is in the platform
435252 if we dont secure the platforms the young people will run right past us
435253 if we have a platform that is inherently secure that is the way to go
435254 you use technology so much you start to understand it you start to trust it people have seen very few failed attempts at technology

435309 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

435324 this industry sic could gain a lot from lightening up a bit musicians are forever complaining about the lack of prominent classical coverage in the national papers but by adopting these kinds of attitudes they are probably deterring the media who are understandably reluctant to publish content that is stuffy elitist and well boring to everyone who is not part of that serious circle
435325 robert stickgold a cognitive neuroscientist at harvard is one of the foremost sleep researchers in the country and has long argued that sleeps crucial function is to boost memory and learning his theory is that during sleep the brain evaluates recently learned information and decides what to do with it in the process memory consolidation takes place memories or skills that were acquired during waking are stabilized or enhanced or perhaps moved to new locations the brain may also extract patterns and rules from large amounts of information
435326 the number one thing im going to do is work on putting fans in the stands everything i do is going to be designed to make the day more interesting the days got to be shorter and faster youve got to find ways to help people figure out how to bet and without looking at complicated forms
435327 when we gave the mice a small amount of daily exercise in the presence or not of the drug all showed an increased ability to run but those on the drug gained an additional hour
435328 its tricking the muscle into believing its been exercised daily
435329 its basically the couch potato experiment and it proves you can have a pharmacologic equivalent to exercise
435330 the drug by itself had no impact on running ability
435331 we were blown away that aicar alone mimicked exercise not to the same level but a healthy boost
435332 in this study we revealed that synthetic ppard activation and exercise or more importantly ampk activation alone provides a robust transcriptional cue that re programs the skeletal muscle genome and dramatically enhances endurance
435333 we believe that the strategy of re organizing the preset genetic imprint of muscle as well as other tissues using exercise mimetic drugs has therapeutic potential in treating certain muscle diseases such as wasting and frailty as well as obesity where exercise is known to be beneficial
435334 both compounds are very logical targets for athletic abuse and we need to be aware of that

435340 that was a pretty good qualifying session quite straightforward it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us im disappointed im on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so well see how we go tomorrow
435341 i was losing a little bit of time in each of the sectors and i couldnt deliver that last little bit of lap time because i was bringing the mid corner speed too low its tough from thirteenth for sure but the hungarian race can be unpredictable so lets see
435342 im happy to have qualified in p12 today after a good lap on the final run in q2 pushed me a few places up the grid
435343 weve definitely made some progress with the new developments to the car and in particular the new rear suspension is working well and this has enabled us to improve the car step by step over the weekend i got the most out of the car today and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top ten as it has been a while since we were that close im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race tomorrow from here nonetheless
435344 choosing which tyre to run was a really tough decision today and it was a difficult qualifying session i felt the supersoft option tyre was working slightly better with the car so i stayed with that for my final run after a good first sector i went in too quick for turn 11 and made a mistake which ruined my lap with that went the chance to progress to q2 and the time from my previous run puts me in 18th place on the grid the lap was going quite well but a mistake at turn 11 meant that i had to abort the lap i have to settle for 18th place today and turn my focus now to the race
435345 there were two waves at the end of that heat and he went on the first one and i took the second and it turned out to be a really good wave
435346 when i came out of the barrel and into the channel everyone was screaming this is the biggest win of my career i have won a few asp wqs events but to beat slater here in these conditions is amazing
435347 when i came up through the cave it felt like i won the event
435348 there were so many people screaming and cheering it felt really good i guess its a big deal that no one else had beat him this year but ive been training hard and i hope to be going much further in this event
435349 i knew i shouldnt have gone on that first wave
435350 congratulations to tiago pires as he surfed really well hes definitely not one who i underestimate and he is probably one of the best barrel riders in the world it was one of those situations that i played through in my head about a minute before it actually happened but that happens from time to time before the contest started i said my luck would have to run out somewhere and i guess it was here
435351 its an unfortunate result here no one likes a 17th
435352 however we get two throwaways and when i do that im still counting four wins this year which is pretty good lowers has always been a good venue for me it feels like my backyard and it is typically one where i do really well you can never discount any one in any heat though these are the best surfers in the world and theyre all dangerous
435353 our heat was so slow for waves it was unbelievable
435354 i was in the water at the end of slater and tiagos heat and when tiago pires came out of the barrel the entire cliff erupted and i thought wow that sure isnt for us because nothing has happened yet fortunately a few rolled through and i was in position to capitalize im happy to be moving through to round 4
435355 tiago pires has been putting in a lot of great performances all year long and it was only a matter of time before he took down a big name
435356 i think what its done is really fired everyone up especially the top seeds since it offers us a chance to gain some ground on kelly slater
435357 some heats will have really good waves while others have a bit of a struggle thankfully for us the waves really turned on there and i was able to grab a couple of good ones
435358 damien hobgood and i are really good friends and weve been surfing out here a lot the past few days
435359 we knew we were seeded pretty close for this round and we were watching all day yesterday to see what would happen seeing who could lose or win so that we didnt end up with each other thats how it goes sometimes and i was able to get a couple of really good ones towards the start and managed to get through
435360 ive had a pretty shocking year so far and i havent managed better than 9th
435361 im fired up to be here though and into round 4 and im ready to break through with a result
435362 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that

435609 programming is a design activity a good software design process recognizes this and does not hesitate to code when coding makes sense
435610 and it is not just coding that is a design activity
435611 coding is design testing and debugging are part of design and what we typically call software design is still part of design
435612 one may get the impression that jack is just a cowboy coder who disdains the traditional notion of design
435613 in software engineering we desperately need good design at all levels in particular we need good top level design the better the early design the easier detailed design will be
435614 eventually we have to create the real software design and it will be in some programming language therefore we should not be afraid to code our designs as we derive them we simply must be willing to refine them as necessary all design activities interact a good software design process recognizes this and allows the design to change sometimes radically as various design steps reveal the need
435615 the source code may be the master design document but it is seldom the only one necessary
435616 what approach they choose doesnt matter until someone starts insisting that these intermediate designs should be products in their own right its the code that matters if you get good code does it really matter how it came about if you dont get good code does it really matter how much other garbage you made people do before they wrote the bad code

435621 even better are species which are resistant to fire blight
435622 the winners include the fruit growers because they get their problem under control
435623 on the losers side are the beekeepers because it cannot be ruled out that honey becomes contaminated with streptomycin and cannot be sold

435796 i was invited to a competition at stoke mandeville and it was there that it was announced i was moving into the development squad

435813 well no keep these kinds of hypotheticals are very difficult hindsight is 20 20 i think what i am absolutely convinced of is that at that time we had to change the political debate because the view of the bush administration at that time was one that i just disagreed with
435814 and so when pressed barack obama says he still would have opposed the surge

435862 it seems that senator obama is described as having one of the most extreme positions that one can find when it comes to the issue of abortion in this article i want to briefly investigate the issue of abortion and determine where senator obama is regarding this issue within the context of the protecting rights of the mother and the developing baby
435863 however i do want to consider shifting some of the meaning of terminology that is always used with this issue fetus and viability it seems to me that given how far todays science and medicine have advanced since 1973 when roe v wade was decided i would hope that we can consider taking a deeper look regarding what science might be able to tell us in terms of the development of the fetus instead of primarily addressing the question in terms of viability of the fetus why not first try to answer the question of when the emergence of a human consciousness or behavior begins then perhaps that could that be the starting point where the states opposing interests begin to collide
435864 i suspect that senator obamas after the fact defense of his votes against the illinois bill were nothing more than political pandering for votes of the worst kind
435865 again the main stream media lets senator obama have a pass just the way they have regarding serious allegations surrounding his associations with rezko wright ayers farrakhan and the many other questionable characters in his life the media is just now starting to cover the john edwards scandal only because they cant avoid it however they continue to avoid like the plague the allegations of larry sinclair that he and senator obama used cocaine and engaged in consensual gay sex in 1999

435980 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
435981 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
435982 it is time that we realize that the pursuit of narrow national interests and pursuit of militant terrorism cannot serve any long term purpose
435983 these terrorist acts point to an alarming threat the wild fire of terrorism is spreading
435984 terrorism is by far the greatest threat facing us today it puts our future generations at risk
435985 terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining greater grip in pakistan
435986 no country in the saarc region has been spared of this plague
435987 we must ensure strengthening regional legal mechanisms and intensifying intelligence sharing
435988 all our regional partners and our many friends in other quarters that have cooperated with us in this matter
435989 the deadly fangs of terrorism are spreading across the region they threaten to disrupt peace and stability
435990 we condemn the heinous terrorist attacks in afghanistan india and pakistan
435991 though pakistan has suffered the most terrorism afflicts all countries of our region it is our joint responsibility to rid our region of this scourge we need to fight terrorism individually as well as collectively
435992 terrorism continues to rear its ugly head in our region it remains the single biggest threat to our stability we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric
435993 we must jointly and with determination fight this scourge we must defend the values of pluralism peaceful co existence and the rule of law
435994 these are gruesome reminders of the barbarity that still finds a place in south asia
435995 peaceful country too is being afflicted by this scourge and fear from transnational crimes
435996 regardless of how peaceful sublime or even desperate a cause may be it can never justify the means to kill and maim innocent men women and children in the most cowardly and barbaric ways
435997 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
435998 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
435999 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
436000 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
436001 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
436002 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
436003 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
436004 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
436005 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president

436010 unfortunately we have no basis to believe that the upcoming election will be free and fair according to international standards
436011 we have not seen any election since 1993 that was democratic they have always been falsified this year i think the situation will be even worse

436053 authorities say their use of a taser weapon should not be questioned
436054 we called the police my wife was afraid he was going to get ran over or hit
436055 he looked a little agitated but other than that he didnt look to be falling down drunk or anything like that
436056 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody lying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
436057 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
436058 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
436059 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
436060 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him
436061 he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
436062 what happened today is far from ideal and if the device was actually a real bomb the way it was handled would have been a disaster
436063 there was an incident today at the brisbane domestic terminal with a bag with an inappropriate comment written on the side

436070 as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of former premier benazir bhutto
436071 it is time we all realise that the pursuit of narrow geo political interest and the use of militant radicalism as instrument of policy cannot succeed or serve any long term purpose
436072 a few television channels like zee group of channels broadcasters are keen for agreement with bsnl and not with any other third party and that had hindered the growth of iptv
436073 bsnl is in the process of acquiring equipment required for download of signals and distribution it will take another year to relaunch the iptv with new infrastructure
436074 if you subsidize something you get more of it if you tax something you get less of it
436075 oh right because of those weapons of mass destruction and everybody knows he personally ordered the september 11 attacks
436076 could it ever be hazardous and self defeating to try to avoid war
436077 well certainly there was bad juju going down at enron
436078 well like any other country with a history the united states has some moments where its a little tough to be proud
436079 well okay but you asked what my opinion was and that piece of evidence is good enough for me

436084 there was a big surge in the sport after that i was inspired by rong to pick up the bat and play
436085 table tennis is a key part of chinese life and its even become a part of our culture
436086 its so simple and it can be played by the very old and very young alike its like a family sport
436087 this is a game we play by the pool whereas my chinese friends say they really need more exercise they need to go play some ping pong
436088 i think were doing fine i think well do fine the second phase if i could just make one very quickly the second phase is iraq there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
436089 the ioc has always been very clear to say we would like the fullest access possible so that you and your colleagues can do your job
436090 thats clear for us its been clearly communicated in a number of meetings with organizers and the authorities they have given many pledges that that will be delivered
436091 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
436092 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
436093 ill kill the remorseless bastard who killed my baby ill never recover from this
436094 my baby is in bits they cant even find her i need her back i just want to get my baby back where she belongs
436095 that monster has taken my girl he took her life and i want his she wasnt an angel but she didnt deserve that
436096 have i got the right balance between work and family
436097 the team has done a good job in improving the car even from the last race so the pace of our car is great
436098 i think it is a great day to have me and heikki to have a 1 2 i think it is about time we did that for the team and we have both done a great job
436099 it is very satisfying because we were quick throughout practice yesterday and also today q2 looked a bit close on the times but i think it was just tyre depended
436100 and i think we made the right tyre choice at the end so im very very happy
436101 but i feel safe in the position we are in and from then on we both have very good strategies to push on and to challenge for the win
436102 i couldnt be in a better position to do that
436103 but today is one day tomorrow is another and i have to make sure i do my preparations right tonight and tomorrow morning and hopefully we can have a great race
436104 i hope we can score a 1 2 the team deserves it and me and heikki will be pushing very very hard
436105 felipe massa doesnt believe it but i have a little bit of time in the bag still i think
436106 the car was great sector one was very strong turn four the quick left was fine but when i got to turn five i just locked up the right front wheel and it pushed me on a little bit
436107 the amendment includes language requiring institutions to make available the development of plans to detect and prevent unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material on the institution of higher educations information technology system
436108 the conferees have combined elements from both bills to require institutions to advise students about this issue and to certify that all institutions have plans to combat and reduce illegal peer to peer file sharing
436109 we work closely with leaders in the higher education community because we both have a stake in ensuring that intellectual property continues to be a strong vibrant part of our nations economy
436110 by including these important provisions in the higher education act congress is sending a strong message that intellectual property is worth protecting
436111 the coroners report doesnt say that police compressed mr abrahams to death
436112 who am i to say mr abrahams was not acting aggressively toward the officers
436113 they intentionally dog piled him it was this intentional conduct that resulted in his death
436114 all those facts support our position that the officers use of force was unwarranted
436115 im hopeful that city of woodland will take full responsibility for the officers conduct and resolve this case without causing the abrahams family to go through the pain of protracted litigation
436116 life is messy from my point of view it is unlikely that the abraham family lost anything that can truly be replaced will 1 million of taxpayer money bring back their son no is it reasonable to assume that their son would have been a huge economic success considering that facts we have from the newspapers no the abrahams have lost something that cant possibly be replaced the life of their son people like the abrahams attorney will fuel the public debate by pointing to the fact that the officers used their tasers and than officers used force that seems like a pretty good way to take down a 300 pound man to me the woodland police department did act purposefully they acted in a manner that law enforcement officers do under those circumstances it is difficult to come to any firm conclusions about their actions if you werent there to judge the situation i for one dont think that the taxpayers of woodland owe the family any large amount of money at all they may have some costs associated with this incident but it is not a major amount of money and it is not going to un ring the bell

436148 die bedingungen waren heute schwierig aber dies war tats chlich das maximum das wir erreichen konnten
436149 das ziel war es gewesen eine 1 21 7 oder 1 21 8 zu fahren und wir fuhren eine 1 21 6 das war also das maximum das wir aus dem auto herausholen konnten
436150 ungl cklicherweise ist das haftungsniveau nach wie vor sehr schlecht
436151 die balance war nicht allzu schlecht aber ungl cklicherweise ist das haftungsniveau nach wie vor sehr schlecht ich denke dass wir hier nicht besonders schnell sind und wir m ssen dies akzeptieren aber wir sind nach wie vor sehr nahe an den anderen dran
436152 es war ein hei es hartes qualifying und ich bin mit der einheit nicht 100 prozentig gl cklich
436153 die reifen verhielten sich nicht so wie erwartet und ich hatte eine menge graining was bedeutete dass wir aus dem auto keine gute balance erzielen konnten
436154 alles in allem bin ich nicht so gl cklich aber lasst uns schauen was morgen passieren wird
436155 ich entschied mich dazu am ende f r meine schnellste runde einen satz h rterer reifen zu verwenden damit hatte ich zumindest nicht den effekt von graining alles in allem bin ich nicht so gl cklich aber lasst uns schauen was morgen passieren wird
436156 wir hatten erwartet dass wir im vergleich zu unseren engsten rivalen etwas zur ckfallen da wir nicht das getriebe ohne zugkraftunterbrechung fahren und das hat sich bewahrheitet
436157 giancarlo hat ziemlich das maximum herausgeholt ungl cklicherweise konnte adrian keine ordentliche runde zusammen bekommen er war aus diesem grund von seiner optimalen zeit weit entfernt
436158 wir wissen dass unsere geschwindigkeit im rennen besser ist als jene im qualifying
436159 wir wissen dass unsere geschwindigkeit im rennen besser ist als jene im qualifying und auch wenn dies das leben auf dieser strecke schwierig gestaltet m ssen wir zwei autos bis ins ziel bringen und professionelle arbeit leisten
436160 es w re ein leichtes zu sagen dass wir uns wieder in der letzten reihe befinden aber wir wurden im ersten qualifying teil durch einen bmw einen honda und einen williams eliminiert es handelt sich hier also erneut um ein sehr konkurrenzf higes feld
436161 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here i have seen how they red sox mistreated other great players when they didnt want to try to turn the fans against them

436166 conditions today were tough but actually that was the maximum we could do
436167 it was a hot tough qualifying and i am not 100 happy with the session the tyres did not behave as we expected and i had lots of graining which meant we couldnt get a good balance out of the car i decided to run the harder set of tyres in the end for my fastest lap but at least i didnt get the effects of the graining with them overall im not that happy but lets see what happens tomorrow

436181 the commissions action leaves creators in the dark as to how a finding of indecency would be avoided based on the merit of the program this type of guidance is not only arbitrary and vague but for creators completely unworkable and unacceptable
436182 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
436183 historians will marvel at why the press wont write more about the egregious abuses and mismanagement at corporate boards in america and the wall street journal article of july 22 is a good example of this abdication
436184 are they intimidated by legions of public relations executives who spend shareholder money to defend bad managers and bad management decisions are they worried their access to management will dry up if they give too much ink to corporate critics are they beholden to the corporate interests of their parent companies the media conglomerates or is it just easier to toe the company line
436185 not all of my investments work out but my record demonstrates that shareholder activism is a viable and essential strategy i applaud those who undertake it providing it is done intelligently and not recklessly or irresponsibly it will be a good day for the american media when activism at faltering companies is applauded and not misunderstood or cast in a negative light as it all too often is

436187 your heavy handed attempts to inject the fcc into the middle of that process threatens to hijack the evolution of the internet to everyones detriment
436188 federal law unambiguously precludes granting full must carry rights to class a stations
436189 ncta has long supported efforts to promote diversity in the communications arena but forcing cable carriage of all class a low power television stations is not the way to achieve that goal and congress has not given the fcc authority to do so
436190 nab did not address the low power tv issue because our board has not taken a formal position on it
436191 maybe its competition in the marketplace for ad dollars or dominance maybe just plain arrogance
436192 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
436193 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity
436194 i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
436195 while we are disappointed with equity valuations placed on our industry and especially cablevisions stock price we are highly confident in the strength of our underlying business
436196 this confidence is clearly supported by our consistently strong operating results which the capital markets are not currently recognizing we have a strong desire to close the value gap between our operating performance and the market value of our stock we recognize that current capital market conditions may contribute significantly to this value gap and we are considering and actively exploring alternatives that may close this gap and want to assure our investors that we will be open to listening to their thoughts in this regard the company and i personally plan to spend more time communicating our compelling story to our investors and listening to their thoughts on our performance and prospects
436197 there are some obvious potential moves the company could make
436198 but we need to study them before we say much more about them we want to tell our story and we want to listen to shareholders about what they think too
436199 use of a p2p file sharing application would constitute a material breach of contract for which the users service could be terminated
436200 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form

436202 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
436203 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
436204 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
436205 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
436206 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
436207 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
436208 the situation has become critical and threatens the safety and security of the nation and its residents
436209 we are deeply disturbed by this imminent loss of communications service to vital public safety agencies
436210 in just a few days the navajo nation will lose its entire communications network including its public safety network as a byproduct of usacs mishandling of this matter
436211 sadly mothers are also no longer able to reach out and communicate with their children at war in iraq
436212 an internal navajo nation audit conducted during the summer of 2007 found problems with the contract between navajo nation and onsat and the bidding process that led to it
436213 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
436214 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
436215 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
436216 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
436217 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
436218 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
436219 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
436220 please join me in congratulating these individuals who have helped build this industry and should give us all great confidence in the future of our company
436221 i look forward to naming additional members of sirius xm radios management in the near future
436222 i am sure that yahoo management will take a verbal beating
436223 i just dont think that the annual meeting is where the debate over yahoo strategy is going to take place
436224 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
436225 it is not going to be a retirees board the benefit of having icahn on the board is the status quo is broken it is going to be under an awful lot pressure to act
436226 some of the bigger shareholders want to push for a new ceo
436227 there is a small possibility that shareholder disappointment results in jerry yang being moved aside in a sort of bloodless coup
436228 communication is vital to everyones daily lifestyle and nowadays it happens to be mobile communication as compared to 10 years ago when wireline communication was a standard
436229 what this shows is that this market is powerful and still has room to grow

436237 today the commission tells comcast to stop and to disclose to its subscribers how it is going to manage traffic on a going forward basis we therefore take another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
436238 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
436239 the commission did not intend for the internet policy statement to serve as rules
436240 commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
436241 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory
436242 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated

436311 that literally is not true the point is obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that he wasnt planning to bring an entourage
436312 when do mccains friends in the media plan on calling him out on this why has he decided to go so negative is he that desperate has he given up any notion of being a maverick why would john mccain outright lie and then continue to spread the lie

436389 this is also why he rejected the christian religion i think for a brief time he converted and even changed his name to johnson but he could not understand such ideas as mercy towards your enemies or that this man jesus could wash away a mans sins to your grandfather this was foolish sentiment something to comfort women

436393 but kneeling beneath that cross on the south side of chicago i felt gods spirit beckoning me i submitted myself to his will and dedicated myself to discovering his truth
436394 an outgrowth of his reading of some of the seminal parts of the bible about doing unto the least of these just as we would have done unto christ
436395 he takes very seriously the numerous passages in the bible that talk not only about poverty but of people of faith taking gods words and extending them beyond the four walls of the church
436396 but she felt that a lot of christians behaved in un christian ways
436397 just one of the many ways and not necessarily the best way that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives
436398 he really came here with a very strong passion about how can we change things and he understood the churches as being a vehicle for doing that
436399 realized that with some churches there would be a credibility issue if he were organizing churches but didnt have a home church
436400 at the foot of that cross inside the thousands of churches across the city i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath moses and pharaoh the christians in the lions den ezekiels field of dry bones those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story
436401 what moved me was the role all the congregations i worked with played in the life of the people i was working with
436402 what touched me was how faith bolstered them against heartache and disappointment and kept them going
436403 the danger of using good versus evil in the context of war is it may lead us to be not as critical as we should be about our own actions

436410 in the 21st century white america got a wake up call after 9 11 01
436411 white america and the western world came to realize that people of color had not gone away faded into the woodwork or just disappeared as the great white west kept on its merry way of ignoring black concerns
436412 i told him i thought it was the wrong decision
436413 the change was made in order to avoid having statements and beliefs being used out of context and forcing the entire church to defend itself
436414 strongly disagrees with any portrayal of the israeli palestinian conflict that advocates divestment from israel or expresses anything less than strong support for israels security
436415 believes its basic tenets of commitment to god to community to self discipline and self reliance continue to have applicability not only to the african american community but to all people
436416 i always remember abraham lincoln when during the civil war he said we shouldnt be asking whose side god is on but whether were on his side
436417 and i think thats the question that all of us have to ask ourselves are we advancing the causes of justice and freedom are we our brothers keeper our sisters keeper and thats how i measure whether what were doing is right
436418 i have given up trying to respond to conservatives who have done no study of liberation theology black theology or african american history
436419 i think he is one of the biggest threats to the republican party and their campaign because he has seized the religious discursive ground no democratic candidate since jimmy carter has been able to do that

436431 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
436432 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
436433 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
436434 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
436435 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
436436 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
436437 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
436438 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
436439 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
436440 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
436441 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
436442 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

436448 they didnt put tebow in to do the things leak can do
436449 they put tebow in to do things that maybe wasnt leaks nature you would think the same would be true if there were things that terrelle could do that perhaps todd doesnt do
436450 so i think that makes a lot of sense if there are some things that terrelle demonstrates he can add to the package that maybe arent todds strong suit then maybe you can find that mixture of everyones strengths
436451 my coaches were really good at developing packages for guys
436452 where you just get him five to 10 plays and those are the 10 plays he knows hes going to run and then he can get comfortable and confidence is just such a huge thing i would be very hesitant to put a guy in a compromising situation early in his career
436453 you have so much time to get ready to face an offense and if beanie wells is the primary focus and the power game and a quarterback that isnt very mobile thats your focus
436454 it takes time away from your preparation to stop beanie wells and todd boeckman
436455 if he can adjust to the preparation and learn the defenses

436486 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life

436488 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
436489 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
436490 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
436491 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

436787 like i told him anything that we can do for him were going to be there for you thats when you really get away from the game of football when life issues hit you that much hes going through a lot but as a man i think hes handling it very well as a family of teammates we want to be there for him by any means necessary that means just having a listening ear or just giving him a word of prayer whatever it may be just to be there for him is what he needs the most
436788 the fact that theyre friends and theyre good guys thats just being good sports but make no mistake about it every one of those three guys want the job its really not a nice guy contest were all nice guys but its a quarterback contest
436789 for the nfl its the only time where you can really do some of the things that you need to practice in order to be productive in the fall
436790 so thats why it makes it special the opening of training camp because now we can have physical contact and some of the things that you really cant do at other times
436791 no 1 is to take care of the football and no 2 dont give up explosive plays
436792 and be good at first down and third down thats where things start with winning football games youve got to overcome injuries weve got to make sure we get in position to be a stronger a deeper football team
436793 yeah last i talked to him about a week ago he was still a little bit bothered by the ankle and hopefully hell take it slow
436794 no theres nothing to mend theres never been any hard feelings between the two of us
436795 he has his stance and whether i feel the same or feel different it doesnt matter were teammates and weve been a great tandem and hopefully well continue to be a great tandem for years to come theres nothing to mend between he and i
436796 he may not know my dad coached at ohio state and beat usc two years in a row 33 0 and 28 12 and if he wants to make something over that he knows where he can find me
436797 i dont watch what i say i cannot stand the buckeyes and having to live in ohio and hear those people talk about their team it drives me absolutely nuts
436798 its amazing to hear what those guys think about that university and that football program and coach jim tressel and all the crap ive got to put up with being back there
436799 im a trojan all the way and i was talking to a trojan audience in california i guess i got a little fired up as all good fans will do
436800 but i really do respect the buckeyes and i know their fans are passionate too i hope they all understand im just looking forward to a big game for my school against a very tough opponent and that its all in the good fun of a rivalry you dont have a real rivalry unless both sides are great teams
436801 im still angry that people think they drafted me too early im going out here to prove them wrong i still have that chip on my shoulder
436802 my receivers coach mike sheppard told me hes got confidence on me and he went up on that board to get me for a reason because they believe in me and i believe in myself too
436803 i know what i can do on this field im just going out here to go to work every day
436804 hes our lead dog isnt he we go as he goes hes a splendid player and we are lucky to have him i have great confidence in him
436805 in the spring time we didnt know where willie anderson was
436806 then he came in here and proved he was in a pretty good spot we have a good issue to deal with as we go forward we have a good young player in stacy and a guy who has been as good a player as there is in the nfl in willie anderson
436807 our goals are going to be simple and that is to come out of training camp a unified hardened group tomlin said
436808 hes an explosive blitz man he can cover a lot of people and he can run hes had a nice offseason his role specifically and where it goes and the speed in which it goes and whatever direction it goes will be determined by the quality of his play in latrobe
436809 some of the changes that we have made in terms of scheduling indicate that it is a concern
436810 because there will be questions that ill have to answer in regards to that and there will be questions that potentially our team has to answer in regard to that
436811 i dont have the answer to those questions and neither does our football team im here to coach theyre here to play those questions will be answered by the rooneys
436812 i think you do it for just that purpose to create great competition so that you can come away with the best 53
436813 anything that we did in that regard had no bearing on willie parkers situation
436814 i dont have the answer to that i really dont at this point
436815 i love football i love this process i love going to camp i love team building readying ourselves to pursue our goals i am extremely excited
436816 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
436817 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
436818 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
436819 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
436820 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
436821 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
436822 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
436823 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
436824 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
436825 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
436826 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
436827 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
436828 but i would like to let you know that since the lineup of the chinese table tennis team is already finalized and made public it seems that my wish could not be granted
436829 in a joint interview with journalists from 25 news organizations across the world
436830 india has recently launched a national action plan on climate change and we will be more than willing to share experiences
436831 i think it is important to pick him from his fingers because most of the variations which he does he does from his fingers and it is important to pick him from his fingers so far it is working well
436832 i hope it continues to be in this series it is difficult because they mendis and muttiah muraltharan have got lot of variations in their armoury you have to react to what they throw at you that is the best way to play against them we just cannot be pre determined against them
436833 so far in the test match we have really played well and i think it is for the bowlers to turn the series around
436834 it is going to be very difficult for the opposition if we can set anything more than 350 we can really set the game for us they have got a good quality attack in murali and mendis it is a good challenge for us
436835 i think anything above 350 is going to be a good target because the wicket is only going to deteriorate from here it is not going to be a very good batting track and specially when harbhajan and kumble in our armoury
436836 i think rahul dravid is a quality player i dont think i need to shield him he has got more than 10 000 runs they were bowling really well and applying a lot of pressure on us but there was never a conscious effort of shielding him at all
436837 the ball drifted a bit i did not expect the ball to drift that much i think i should have got a 100 and i am a bit disappointed
436838 this covenant is a badly needed mechanism for solving our problems

436852 by making the same objects the same commodities available to everybody modern society has reduced the opportunity for conflict and rivalry the problem is that if this is pushed to the extreme as in contemporary consumer societies then people ultimately lose all interest in these universally available and identical objects it takes a long time for people to become disaffected but this finally happens the consumer society because it renders objects available at the same time makes them eventually undesirable working towards its own consumption like all sacrificial solutions the consumer society needs to reinvent itself periodically it needs to dispose of more and more commodities in order to survive moreover the market society is devouring the earths resources just as primitive society devoured its victims
436853 one buys objects with one hand and throws them away with the other in a world where half the human population goes hungry the consumption society has simply become a system of exchange of signs rather than an exchange of actual objects this is why we live in a minimalist and anorexic world because the world in which consumption is a sign of wealth is no longer appealing therefore one has to look emaciated or subversive in order to look cool as thomas frank would put it the only problem is that everybody resorts to the same tricks and once again we all begin to look alike the consumer society at its extreme turns us into mystics in the sense that it shows us that objects will never satisfy our desires
436854 the paradox of mimetic desire is that it seems solidly fixed on its object stubbornly determined to have that object and no other object whereas in reality it very quickly shows itself to be completely opportunistic
436855 i f you believe the scapegoat is guilty you are not going to name it as being my scapegoat this is the key role of m connaissance in the process it allows one to have the illusion that one is justly accusing someone who is really guilty and therefore deserves to be punished in order to have a scapegoat one must fail to perceive the truth and therefore one cannot represent the victim as a scapegoat but rather as a righteous victim a righteously chosen victim i believe he means which is what mythology does to scapegoat someone is to be unaware of what you are doing
436856 do you think that the more mimetic one is the stronger the m connaissance unknowing will be
436857 i will answer with a paradox the more you are mimetic the stronger is your m connaissance and also the possibilities of understanding it suddenly you realize that the nature of your own desire is strictly imitative i believe all great writers of mimetic desire are hyper mimetic we could say that if one is hyper mimetic one is in a better position to understand oneself as a puppet of mimetic desire simply because the caricature one has become makes it easier to understand the systematically self defeating nature of ones own behaviour
436858 my conclusion is that we choose these ideologies because we really need them perhaps more than other people do buddhists really need meditation to help them let go of the tyranny of emotion and opinion mindspeak looping storylines that burdens them mt adherents really need to see rivalry and violence for what it is and are perhaps particularly rivalrous and imitative and rightly seek a pacific model whats disturbing to me is that i am drawn to both buddhism and mt

436864 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
436865 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

436874 im convinced that the majority of the croatian people are shocked by the way the funeral of the jasenovac commander and murderer dressed in an ustasha uniform was conducted
436875 at the same time i strongly condemn the inappropriate words of the priest who served at the funeral and said that sakic was a model for all croats im convinced it is not an official attitude of the catholic church in croatia

436892 the place where the killing happened is very remote and can only be accessed by aircraft so far the police have not even been to the scene to get the facts on the ground
436893 its been a pretty decent weekend for us so far and i feel safe with the position were in
436894 the team have done a great job in improving our car even from the last weekend and it would be great to get a 1 2 on sunday it would be about time
436895 i wasnt 100 percent happy with my laps in q3
436896 i went out on the track at a little bit of a wrong time when there were too many cars around
436897 that made it really tricky for the preparation of my tyres but i think our lap times from the first two qualifying sessions showed that we are pretty strong
436898 i definitely have the feeling we can push these guys tomorrow

436903 i wanted to show them there was a better way than the way they were going
436904 i want them to realize the importance of a good name and reputation
436905 i resigned myself a long time ago to the idea that this is what i do
436906 the idea of building a stronger bigger more comprehensive institution with this new set of capabilities was one of the best thing that could happen
436907 i even have more fond regard for that decision now than i did then
436908 being the largest also means that an awful lot of people think we have what we need which is far from the truth
436909 i would think private fundraising is an important part of the work that hes going to be doing
436910 i see dr brown as being able to take on the challenge of being able to communicate with potential donors and at the same time communicate with the hip hop generation of students that we have
436911 when they ask us for money it wont be the first time were seeing their faces
436912 we need to re establish an ethos for the institution from the level of the student up through the faculty and the alumni
436913 some of the tough decisions and choices that had to be made meant that the local and national community heard a little disharmony in the clark atlanta university community
436914 i think that his opportunity is really to ensure that the entire clark atlanta university community is speaking with one very positive voice about its extraordinary resources and tradition and record

436930 its late in the day and again my iphone 3gs battery is running low
436931 that makes this an apt time to take a fresh look at an increasingly important part of our gadget portfolio those portable charging devices that provide a shot of juice in a pinch
436932 the iphone 3g magnifies such issues the wi fi connection the faster network speeds and gps features all strain the battery so for the last week ive been using a few portable chargers to keep the iphone and some other gadgets ready to go
436933 it provides a supplemental charge ken klarfeld ipowerrush president said of his portable charging device one of the first targeting the iphone 3g
436934 the iphone battery was nearly dead when i plugged the ipowerrush into the iphone about 45 minutes later i had enough power to make it home a 30 minute commute playing with the iphone all the way
436935 another approach is a portable charger with multiple connectors or tips these tips are made for ipods various mobile phones digital mobile phones and countless other gadgets
436936 one of my favorites is the powerstick a 70 device powerstick
436937 again the iphone was nearly empty when i connected the powerstick it didnt fully charge the device but it provided a longer charge than the ipowerrush
436938 you recharge the powerstick via usb so when its empty you simply plug it into a computers usb port a recharge takes about 30 minutes
436939 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
436940 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment
436941 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
436942 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
436943 this is the result of a deliberate strategy and policy
436944 these are 17 cheats who will not falsify the competition
436945 we are working with the international federations to step up tests before the games
436946 we dont have that money and we have to do our best with what weve got and make the players better what are our limits do you get half a bentley a quarter of bentley do we get a bentley right leg
436947 were about threadbare right now but the players i have here are all ive got
436948 one way or another we have to have passers on and then battlers on and we have to be ready for all sorts of games its easy for them spurs to progress when they have money to spend
436949 people have told me that i looked sad when i was i competing but i never complained
436950 people assume a lot of things about gymnasts that the girls work too hard its way too much for them they are too young to work so hard i never personally complained everybody else complained for me
436951 in any case it was not too hard it was what it takes to be an olympic champion also nobody says anything about boys at 12 13 years old working too hard its only the girls oh poor girls why are we treated differently
436952 i basically have my life today as a result of what i did as a child what did i miss out on yeah i missed not hanging out at shopping malls i guess but that is not a big deal because you dont get a medal for that
436953 when i look back i am happy that my mum took me to the gymnastics club i didnt join gymnastics to become a famous athlete or celebrity it just happened i did more than i expected of course
436954 what is different is that they can make a living from gymnastics and people stay longer in the sport also you dont have to do four events you can specialise in one so that shortens their workout we had to do compulsory as well dont forget
436955 but the hard work is the same there is no magic pill you have to work and train hard
436956 people asked what was the secret of romanian gymnastics we just worked twice as hard as everyone else now everyone does it which is why they are much better
436957 it is still there it is considered number two to soccer with our results in the seventies and everything we did the people are still proud got recognised through gymnastics
436958 thatll do its no rolls royce but what do you expect the door is knackered
436959 no need to tell me just how incredibly stupid it is for me to be here timelines and all that figured it out all on my own itd be best if you forget this
436960 yeah yeah okay im working on it dont worry everything is fine ive got things under control
436961 ladies and gentlemen youll have to excuse me i have an important matter to attend to if were lucky ill return in a moment with some fantastic news
436962 so whos up for a game of truth or dare
436963 right off saving the world or something first a hot shower and then ill find you and kick your ass
436964 dont think you can run forever you bastard ill be waiting
436965 whats a few more years when it seems ive got eternity
436966 it is a necessary part of keeping the web alive but one that is so separate from the creation of a website that it makes me laugh every time i think about it information technology is and always should be concerned with the reliability stability and effectiveness of serving a website those creating websites should focus their complete attention on the effectiveness of the message the design the interface and the content when you get down to it any website and i mean any website is all about communication communication has never been the expertise of it nor should it have to be communication is the job of marketers it should be done by those deeply connected to the product

436969 in the event we were ever confronted with having to interrogate a detainee with knowledge of an imminent threat to millions of americans then the decision to depart from standard international practices must be made by the president and the president must be held accountable

436979 last season was the first full season i have played since i have started football
436980 it is the most games ive played so if i can take that again and play all season for wigan that will be great
436981 hopefully i will have a bit more luck in the next few years it is a tough league and you have to be as fit as you can be
436982 but its nice to have a season without rehab and hopefully ill get another one next season
436983 whatever has gone before has gone every season is different this league gets tougher every year so first thing is to make sure we stay up and that is not being negative because it is a tough league and the teams that are coming up will be difficult to beat
436984 a lot of teams are looking up to us because we won the u 21 euros twice in a row
436985 every team is dreaming about olympic success and so are we our team has some big names too were not afraid of brazil or argentina
436986 the worlds best athletes are participating its fantastic to have the possibility to be one of them these kind of things are the highlights in a sportsmans career
436987 but ill do my best to secure a starting spot

436990 im fine the problem i had to my ligaments is over
436991 some players have arrived which can help us to grow as a team also the young players who are showing themselves give hope for the future i still think that in any case what can make us have the better against other teams is our will to win and determination youve seen that juve give their best even in friendlies like at the trofeo tim we dont like to lose let alone against teams like inter and milan
436992 cause i do believe thats when i first heard that tune
436993 i was totally shocked that a member of the city council would be so bold as to propose such a thing

437090 i just think they are more exciting i think it depends on the lap times as well this is one of the longest lap times that we have besides a road course to go 500 miles under this lap time is a long long day and its gets pretty spread out i just think we could put on a little more exciting race being a 400 mile race i think would be a great show for the competitors and for the fans
437091 yeah i think thats obvious i think nascar thinks its too long but i think the track owners could care less how long it is but they dont have to be out there running

437099 in fulfillment of the lords promise previously made that the law would be given in ohio see section 38 32 the law of consecration is revealed and connected in verse 35 to the
437100 thou shalt ask and it shall be revealed unto you in mine own due time where the new jerusalem shall be built
437101 upon the land which i will consecrate to my people which are a remnant of jacob
437102 all believe in one doctrine even the doctrine of our lord and savior jesus christ
437103 the building up of zion is a cause that has interested the people of god in every age it is a theme upon which prophets priests and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live
437104 have sund and written and prophesied of this our day
437105 every righteous man will build up for a place of safety for his children
437106 in regard to the building up of zion it has to be done by the counsel of jehovah by the revelations of heaven
437107 we believe in the literal gathering of israel and in the restoration of the ten tribes that zion the new jerusalem will be built upon the american continent
437108 men and angels are to be co workers in bringing to pass this great work and zion is to be prepared

437110 i cannot learn from any communication by the spirit to me that zion has forfeited her claim to a celestial crown
437111 i cannot learn from any communication by the spirit to me that zion has forgeited her claim to a celestial crown notwithstanding the lord has caused her to be thus afflicted except it may be some individuals who have walked in disobedience and forsaken the new covenant
437112 i know that zion in due time of the lord will be redeemed
437113 if zion will not purify herself so as to be approved of in all things in his sight he will seek another people
437114 for his work will go on until israel is gathered and they who will not hear his voice must expect to feel his wrath
437115 repent repent is the voice of god to zion and strange as it may appear yet it is true mankind will persist in self justification until all their iniquity is exposed and their character past being redeemed and that which is treasured up in their hearts be exposed to the gaze of mankind
437116 i say to you and what i say to you i say to all hear the warning voice of god lest zion fall adn the lord swear in his wrath that the inhabitants of zion shall not enter into his rest
437117 so long as unrighteous acts are suffered in the church it cannot be sanctified neither can zion be redeemed

437194 i tried to meet the family but it was very difficult i also tried to have some information about the cadets because she was a cadet

437224 i became very concerned that such a distasteful policy was being openly encouraged but i soon left to study in the us in the early 1980s and i thought this way of thinking would soon pass
437225 but there was no discernable change in policies and attitudes when i returned and i soon joined the opposition
437226 my main aim then was and still is to fight unjust laws in the country and be an advocate for free speech it is unconstitutional to be denied the opportunity to speak in public
437227 the media were a lot more balanced when i first entered politics in the early 1990s they were reasonably fair in their reporting of what i had to say
437228 but now well now theyve gone too far not only have they become way too personal in their attacks they consistently misrepresent what i stand for
437229 which is that im out to do singapore in that i do not have the countrys best interest at heart that is the biggest myth thats constantly being perpetuated about me period when all i stand for is for a more open tolerant society to respect one anothers differences and to move the country with the times
437230 such is the nature of the beast all these caustic attacks dont even bother me anymore you just have to steel yourself and roll with the punches
437231 you know its very easy to do the accepted and popular things but for real change to come about one has to take a firm stand on ones beliefs and see it all the way through
437232 i can take heart that more are coming forward to speak up and speak out but i stress that we advocate change in a non violent way with a capital n
437233 definitely not this is the life i have chosen for myself and i actually spend many a fruitful day writing books and papers selling our party newsletter on the street and engaging with all sorts of people via the sdp portal
437234 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit
437235 our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health our keynote speaker dr a k susheela executive director fluorosis research and rural development foundation probably knows more about fluorides toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist it is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say
437236 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
437237 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
437238 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health

437247 nach der sprechstunde sa ich nochmal zwei stunden da um alle m glichen papiere zu erledigen dar ber hinaus ist es so es gibt eine budgetierung das hei t ungeachtet dessen wie h ufig ein patient mich als arzt ben tigt ist die honorarmenge die gleiche
437248 ich habe im vierten quartal vom oktober bis zum dezember 57 patienten nicht bezahlt bekommen ich habe im ersten quartal 2008 etwa 40 patienten nicht bezahlt bekommen dem patienten kann man jetzt nat rlich nicht sagen ich behandle dich nicht mehr weil ich mit meinem budget am ende bin und insofern empfinde ich so etwas einfach was rzte anbelangt nicht zumutbar
437249 ich halte ihn f r einen sehr guten arzt und ich bedaure es sehr dass er in die schweiz geht ich hab verst ndnis f r ihn mit den kostenproblemen und mit den einkommensproblemen die bei uns die rzte haben
437250 andererseits f r uns tut es uns leid damit muss man fertig werden und ich hoffe das vertrauen zu seiner nachfolgerin wird das gleiche vertrauen wie zu dr rauscher
437251 es gibt ja gar keine jungen rzte mehr die in deutschland bleiben unser eigener sohn hat deutschland verlassen wir haben ein medizinstudium finanziert und nach dem praktischen jahr hat er gesagt danke das wars f r dieses system hab ich nicht studiert und der ist ins ausland und der kommt auch nicht mehr zur ck
437252 wer viel arbeitet weil viel los ist der wird eben besser honoriert als jemand der wenig arbeitet und ich finde das einfach fair es geht mir auch nicht darum in die schweiz zu gehen um mir eine goldene nase zu verdienen sondern ich m chte als arzt arbeiten k nnen ich m chte mich voll und ganz meinen patienten widmen k nnen ohne finanzielle sorgen zu haben

437271 the move will help further promote quranic values and concepts in the society in a better manner
437272 i view it as extremely important as enhancing our independence because as everybody knows we are very vulnerable restricted to two flights one to bali one to darwin
437273 i dont view the airline only for passengers but also for air cargo so i believe it will be very profitable for the investors with this airline if and when we have fisheries flowers fruits vegetables we can also export them directly to singapore

437275 this year what we have conceptualised is to bring the fireworks nearer to the audience

437277 there will be a vigorous assessment made by the spfs director of operations to do an evacuation
437278 then a message will be displayed at the parade area together with a voice message to urge the public to stay calm and at the same time to evacuate orderly following the instructions of the ushers as well as the officers at the scene to a safe location
437279 at the same time we will activate the contingency forces to do the rescue work and implement necessary measures to restore normalcy
437280 we are strategically located at the vicinity of the parade area and we can respond within a moments notice
437281 over and above this we have been working with the police and saf singapore armed forces organisers planning for any contingency looking at areas where we can gel our responses and synergise our efforts
437282 i wasnt 100 percent happy with my laps in q3 because i went onto the track a bit at the wrong time
437283 there were so many slow cars on their out lap i like to go flat and quickest but you cannot pass them so it is tricky to prepare the tyres
437284 i could not prepare the tyres like i was supposed to i could not do a great lap like in q1 and q2
437285 we are pretty strong we didnt seem to be pretty strong until this morning but then look at laptimes of q1 and q2 i think we are there

437292 now children if i stood on my head the blood as you know would run into it and i would turn red in the face
437293 then why is it that while i am standing upright the blood doesnt run into my feet
437294 boys we all know i have been here for five years once we settled our differences we agreed on which 100 of the cows would be mine i dont know where this newcomer is going to get his cows but i aint givin him any of mine
437295 that pretty much says it for me too ive been here for three years and have earned my right to the 50 cows we have agreed are mine ill fight him off or kill him but im keeping all my cows
437296 ive only been here a year and so far you guys have only let me have 10 cows to take care of i may not be as big as you fellows yet but i am young and virile so i simplymust keep all my cows
437297 ahem you know its actually been some time since i was doing all my cows justice anyway i think i can spare a few for our new friend
437298 ill have plenty of cows to take care of if i just stay on the opposite side of the paddock from him im certainly not looking for an argument
437299 son let me give you some advice real quick let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it

437308 be strong and courageous do not be afraid for the lord your god is with you wherever you go
437309 i know the summer vacations still got four weeks to run but i suppose we should be thinking about schooling for dita shouldnt we hon
437310 dyou think shes ready though i mean shes still getting used to being on earth you dont think its too much for her and have we taught her enough about our customs here we dont want her to stick out for her sake as well as keeping the stargate secret
437311 but shes sharper than a tack that one i really dont think therell be a problem cassiell help i know and i think we should send her to cassies first school dont you they were real good with cassie and the kids were too i think maybe we should talk to dita tonight see how she feels about it
437312 no idea mom she was fine earlier but looks like somethings bugging her now
437313 lets give her an hour or so if she doesnt come back in then well go after he
437314 she might talk to me you never know she wont want to say anything that she thinks might upset you sam she thinks the world of you
437315 im just sad she couldnt talk to me im supposed to be her mom now and shes too scared to even talk to me
437316 none of us know whats wrong with deetie but one thing i do know she isnt scared of you she loves you more than any of us more than cassie even and she adores cassie lets leave them be for a while see what cass comes up with
437317 i never even guessed she heard us talking about sending her to school and she panicked what sort of a mother am i if i didnt even know something as important as that
437318 wow well i never guessed either baby it just never occurred to me i mean its not something i thought of dont beat yourself up sam
437319 we all missed it and for the record youre a spectacular mom just ask deetie and cassie
437320 i wouldnt swap either of my moms for anything youve both been amazing i mean most of the time i could probably live without you ever cooking for me again sam
437321 but apart from that id say you two are about perfect
437322 dyou think dita would mind if i go talk to her
437323 its real nice in here isnt it dita im not surprised you like to come here look at that spider
437324 lie down next to me sweetie and look straight up
437325 after all ill bet hes never seen anything as interesting as us before
437326 im sorry im so dumb i know youre like some sort of genius and i cant even read
437327 a lot of people cant read and write and it doesnt make them or you stupid not for one second all it means is that nobody taught you well teach you well have you reading in no time at all
437328 why would you want a daughter who cant even read
437329 not if i dont even notice that my own daughter has a big problem thats making her unhappy i cant bear it when youre unhappy dita and it isnt that big of a deal you know that well start teaching you today ill bet that by the time the month is out youll wonder what all the fuss is about
437330 my mom was teaching me but then she got sick and then
437331 im sorry i was so stupid i never even thought about it i can be real dumb sometimes
437332 it really will dita i promise you i have an idea we can ask daniel to help out hes a linguist he knows all about language and hes done some teaching too hell help us work out a schedule and maybe catherine and ernest will want to get involved too you like them huh
437333 he showed me a trick he did with a pack of cards and he found a silver dollar in my ear
437334 we can do things like take her bowling going to the zoo flying kites all the things that ernest and i missed out on when we didnt have children ourselves and dont worry
437335 well work too shell be reading and writing fluently before you know it shes a smart child sam
437336 oh i know that catherine she real smart shes just been a bit knocked off balance by this and shes already had enough to deal with in her life
437337 and ernest and i will enjoy having her around shell bring some life to the place
437338 shell have to come into the base with us sometimes you realize that
437339 we can both set up a corner for her ill find room in my office and you can do the same in your lab and when neither of us is around therell always be somebody who can help out itll only be for a couple of months tealcs always nagging that he wants to see her more often and i can just tell that general hammonds itching to take her to meet his granddaughters shell be spoilt for choice
437340 and we can still work at the shelter on fridays
437341 and i plan to start next week now that this
437342 did you know sam that its the daddy penguins who have to do all the hard work the moms leave them for ages while they look after the eggs isnt that amazing
437343 not often you find a man wholl do all the work
437344 we did and perdita read the printed guide and told us where we should go next
437345 i wanted to get something nice for cassie and i found it all by myself sam i really did i read the label
437346 she found it herself mom she read the label all by herself dont you think shes amazing
437347 one of these days itll be a beautiful beach pretty ladies and mai tais waiting for you
437348 or whatever the alien equivalent happens to be on that planet
437349 why did command feel the need to send us along on this little jaunt again
437350 i do believe it relates to the intelligence on the locals they are considered to be peculiar if i remember correctly
437351 and the last time a team went to meet locals described that way you ended doing an extraction
437352 so maybe trying to save on time and gate operations or the ounce of preventive theory got you added to the roster
437353 youd almost think we had a reputation for trouble or something
437354 sg 1 sir no rep there since all your assignments go as smooth as silk
437355 you look greatly stressed did you encounter some troubles in your journey
437356 we did come through the great ring a short while ago we are peaceful explorers who came hoping to establish a friendship with your people if possible we didnt have troubles getting here but where we are from such activities are conducted in a much more private venue
437357 ah we on maidai usually conduct such matters in private as well but today is a day of celebration two of our young have entered into their fist marriage
437358 i am ioseo oine prime presbyter here i had the honour of marrying the two boys
437359 i am daniel jackson this is colonel jack oneill major samantha carter tealc
437360 ah yes it is common for individuals to take on more than one spouse over their lifetimes of course except in dire circumstances each marriage is for life though we do not often find such circumstances arise
437361 well at least one at a time we are a little freer on the circumstances of it not lasting a life time
437362 and our celebrations tend to consist more of over eating drinking and possibly dancing
437363 this planet is very serene no signs of recent conflict no troubles with neighbours or goauld
437364 it has been generations since the goauld have visited we have security to alert us to the presence of those creatures though you carry weapons and have a jaffa among you it was the belief of the council that you had no hostile intent so we let you come to find out the purpose of your arrival
437365 if you turned out to be hostile our weaponry would be more than capable to handle any assault it has after all defended us from the goauld
437366 so you are telling me that they have weaponry on a level that could help us with the goauld but it is dependent on us being compatible in our values
437367 for once it isnt because we are too immature to handle such responsibility nope this time its gonna be because of our attitudes toward less conventional relationships so close to getting some big honking space guns
437368 or what we consider unconventional i know we werent there very long but it was quite clear that the relationship type being referred to by the colonel was not in the least odd to them
437369 i was referring to the polygamous nature of their society it isnt a common practise among even our most liberal of allies
437370 i have no problem with but i dont need to see it in action
437371 we were treated to a little boy on boy action
437372 boy on boy was kinda hot and we know if had been girl on girl wed still be back there watching
437373 homosexuality polygamy i can see why there might be a problem
437374 id suggest we send a team to get a better understanding on the congruency of our value systems ioseo didnt seem overly disturbed by our mention of monogamy so it might not be as bad as we think
437375 might want to make the team civilian heavy though easier to avoid bringing up the antiquated attitudes of the us military
437376 i have noticed that the topic that the air force most feared isnt on there
437377 that is because you need to break out of your earth centric thinking a little
437378 for us to talk about relationships we pretty much assume heterosexual only unless specifically homosexual mentioned here theyve cleared up the polygamy versus monogamy issue quickly by saying though they think we are a little backwards it is a difference they can live with we had specifically told them were monogamous in our relationships or at least serial monogamists type if i remember sams comments correctly we did not go down that other path seemed safer
437379 why did i know you were going to say something like that
437380 i have a feeling they arent going to be happy about the whole not allowed to serve military clause and have trouble buying dont ask dont tell let alone that not all of us in the stargate program even recognize the legitimacy of same sex relationships
437381 i guess we should be grateful they are only holding us to the values of those allies and not the whole planet
437382 we could pretend to be canadian same continent and similar accent
437383 think theyd notice if suddenly started ending everything with eh
437384 maybe we should just not mention it and pretend ignorance should they find out hey once we got the technology
437385 a plan but one i assure you will fail aliens always find out
437386 oh well well just have to sell programs like dont ask dont tell as us progressing down the right road and be prepared once again to get a mini lecture on our backwardness
437387 no i am not inviting you up to my room to look at my etchings
437388 what do you mean why not its your policy regarding our conduct off world
437389 your policy i suggested some leniency for situations like this but you said no so now you have to live with it
437390 you know you pick some very strange times to actually listen to me
437391 and shouldnt it be inviting me up to see your rubbings what with you being an archaeologist
437392 is this going to lead to another round of frottage jokes because that is not going to help your case at all
437393 but my cause is hopeless anyway so that isnt going to discourage me now is it
437394 youre planning on torturing me with them until i offer sex just to get you to stop
437395 i was not told you were a couple i do apologize for not placing you in the same room
437396 we dont share rooms when visiting other planets unless it is necessary
437397 no fraternizing helps us keep our wits around us when in more problematic situations and for the sake of consistency we take the same approach on all planets we visit
437398 we have got to be more careful it could have just as easily been a member of our delegation and there goes your career
437399 saving the world only buys you so much good will
437400 plus i knew everyone else had headed outside for a while i originally came over to ask if you wanted to join them but your mind went elsewhere
437401 for crying out loud daniel how was i supposed to know the man was going to say that
437402 i havent had as much as a single real conversation with him
437403 i dont know how to break this to the two of you but your relationship is one of the worse kept secrets ever
437404 there is no one at the sgc that didnt know nor is there anyone there who really cares
437405 they are using my private life as a way to garner an agreement a relationship i am forced to hide suddenly becomes okay or at least okay enough to be used to an advantage by the very organization that caused me to have to hide it i have the right to be upset
437406 and you should be more upset too suddenly it wont cost you your career because there are such huge benefits new ways to blow people up involved
437407 daniel what is done is done dont have a time machine handy to go back and change it
437408 there is no point crying of spilt milk thats all im saying
437409 well deal with whatever fallout if and when it comes and as much as i do like the idea of having those big honkin space guns i am not happy about having my private life used in such a manner not without my permission but then travers couldnt exactly get that the whole dont ask side of the equation
437410 oneill is correct daniel jackson it cannot be unsaid so let us hope it does get us the treaty
437411 everything okay in here i told the maidains that the ruckus was more about your privacy as a couple than anything else to minimize damage i had no idea travers was going to reveal something so personal or i would have stopped him
437412 it was the shock of hearing it being stated so matter of fact
437413 well i knew that there were people who might have suspected but not to the level where they could speak of it with such confidence
437414 the maidains are hoping to get the negotiations back on their way so if everyone is calm enough
437415 you are letting all this slide way too much and all because of those stupid guns
437416 if it came down to it id pick us but the whole thing as you may have noticed was completely out of my hands i always thought wed be outed getting caught doing it off world
437417 and that was when the maidains started give us quite the lecture regarding our treatment of these two sir
437418 well not our treatment per se but that of the military in general they couldnt understand how they could be considered respectful enough to be allowed to do first contact mission while at the same time have to hide who they are to each other or jack could be out a career
437419 i live with it every day and have yet to figure out the logic of it but sg 1 works and no one wants to tamper with what is working in such an unknown you are the experts
437420 see i told you we had nothing to worry about
437421 no need to out and out lie here just fuzz a little
437422 just fuzz the report a little and how is that different from lying
437423 what is the prognosis for us coming to an agreement with these people and gaining access to their technology
437424 we pretty much have to get rid of the ban on gays before well get any further they did not view the policy with an understanding unlike our explanation regarding marriages and how these decisions are made through a major rule
437425 the majority may rule but that does not mean that the majority is always correct
437426 and this didnt work on dont ask dont tell because
437427 because they couldnt understand how the policy was suppose to be helpful
437428 homosexuals still cant actually serve their interpretation was that as long as a person didnt do or say anything that could give themselves away or were lucky enough to serve under those who would turn a blind eye everything was okay but a simple change in command or someone officially reporting that person and its all over not matter how careful they are it allows for very uneven treatment of a particular group of people and was simply unacceptable to them
437429 so you see all we need to do is sell the brass on dumping the policy have them to get it by politicians who have to sell it to the general public all without the benefit of discussing how friendly aliens can help us protect ourselves from meaner nastier aliens
437430 give me a gouald any day of the week over bureaucracy good luck with that sir
437431 why dont you all head out i have what i need from the debriefing
437432 i expect a quick turn around on those mission reports however might as well have all the ammo we can get
437433 got to take the boyfriend out for dinner to make up for being the calmer more rational one when we were outed on another planet he hates it when that happens
437434 id enjoy it sir it will probably never happen again
437435 it doesnt count when you are the only one in the room
437436 but ill definitely let you treat this time since i usually in the mans role
437437 get out of here before i decide you two should be the ones to sell the idea of doing what is needed to get that treaty with the maidains
437438 this occurs despite efforts to continue goltvs availability to dish customers
437439 goltv has removed this channel after asking for unreasonable terms to renew the contract and were working to solve the problem
437440 somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
437441 and i certainly never expected a presidential candidate to suggest militarizing american cities
437442 my dad had the satisfaction of playing a round of golf at the us club a day before his untimely and shocking death he thoroughly enjoyed the game on a wet turf and wanted to comeback the next as well which only proves he kept himself fit but destiny willed otherwise
437443 the most i might do is take a few classes at the academy but dont worry i wont be taking a gun home ever
437444 i had my gun locked up but he still got at it
437445 we should get the barbecue started before everyone gets here
437446 mark and amanda are joining us for the meal and amandas kids
437447 yeah but you dont have to stay you and daniel can close yourself away in the apartment if you want
437448 you were talking to jack about our adoption plans this afternoon
437449 do you think he was okay with the full house this evening after everything you two talked about
437450 do you think amanda and denise will agree to be godparents i mean apart from anything at least theyll be able to talk to the child about life as an adopted person
437451 it isnt as though there wont be any female influences in the childs life

437500 cassies decorated her room exactly as she wants it whereas the room youre in now hasnt been used much it was just a spare bedroom before you came along so it hasnt got any real character to it but we dont have to sweetie its totally up to you

437513 reverend there has been a terrible misunderstanding i never said you were a member of the klu klux klan i simply told a couple of my friends that you were a wizard under the sheets

437539 no ha habido nunca diferencias ni en lo pol tico ni en lo ideol gico que marquen distancia entre nosotros
437540 hemos mantenido y seguimos manteniendo las conversaciones con nuestros aliados de siempre desde el a o 1998 con los cuales en principio no ha habido nunca diferencias ni en lo pol tico ni en lo ideol gico que marquen distancia entre nosotros
437541 ellos nos han acompa ado a lo largo de todo este proceso iniciado en 1998 antes del triunfo electoral y desde mucho antes nos han acompa ado
437542 pol ticamente no tenemos diferencias lo que pasa es que en la coyuntura electoral considerando que los comicios son un instrumento una instituci n de la democracia liberal y como es la democracia liberal que centra su acci n en la competencia en este sentido las elecciones tienen un efecto normalmente divisor en las sociedades y ese efecto divisor polarizador genera problemas incluso en grupos que son bastante cohesionados tanto desde la perspectiva afectiva como desde la perspectiva pol tica
437543 de manera que en este proceso electoral como ha ocurrido en los anteriores siempre ha habido tensiones entre el movimiento que hoy est organizado en el psuv porque la mayor parte de los cuadros que pertenecieron a esos partidos y muy buena parte de la militancia ahora forman parte del psuv
437544 por esto se ha generado alg n distanciamiento como en otras oportunidades derivadas del deseo de mantener espacios pol ticos en una situaci n donde posiblemente se ha perdido la expectativa de lo que est ocurriendo a nivel mundial en relaci n con la democracia liberal
437545 las instituciones de esa democracia liberal est n en franco decaimiento y por ello es que ha ocurrido la emergencia de muchos l deres que personalmente conocen y tienen una relaci n directa con el pueblo
437546 casi todos los partidos de ese corte que funcionaban dentro de los mecanismos de la democracia liberal han perdido significado

437552 christian doctrine is offensive to muslims the archbishop of canterbury said yesterday
437553 this takes us at once into consideration of the trinitarian language used by christians to speak of god we recognise that this is difficult sometimes offensive to muslims but it is all the more important for the sake of open and careful dialogue that we try to clarify what we do and do not mean by it and so trust that what follows will be read in this spirit
437554 dr rowan williams also criticised christianitys history for its violence its use of harsh punishments and its betrayal of its peaceful principles
437555 religious identity has often been confused with cultural or national integrity with structures of social control with class and regional identities with empire and it has been imposed in the interest of all these and other forms of power despite jesus words in johns gospel 5 christianity has been promoted at the point of the sword and legally supported by extreme sanctions despite the quranic axiom 6 islam has been supported in the same way with extreme penalties for abandoning it and civil disabilities for those outside the faith there is no religious tradition whose history is exempt from such temptation and such failure
437556 to believe in an absolute religious truth is to believe that the object of our belief is not vulnerable to the contingencies of human history gods mind and character cannot be changed by what happens here in the world
437557 we know from personal experience that true love can not be commanded or conditioned it is freely given and received
437558 jesus teaches us to recognise as neighbour even those who set themselves against us this is partly required by humility before the design of god in history and the limited nature of our perspective for we do not know who among those who confront us in hostility today will turn out to be our friends on the last day when we stand before our judge

437617 hey horatio my man this sure is one mutha fluffin blockhouse i shonuf dig it on the outside baby but inside man i got the heebie geebies
437618 what about those mushrooms that grow up at danglydong dell
437619 things look kind of groovy after eating a few of those
437620 you better believe it horatio my man did ya recognize the badge
437621 oh man you musta seen it it kinda stood out a whole bit
437622 so what was so special about it apart from the location that is
437623 a high priest of the church of the painted privates and you know baby the dude only told me where i could join up im goin there right now see ya around horatio baby give my best to ya mamma
437624 can you change the spark plug of a hardly worthit with yer teeth
437625 these muthas aint got no idea that horatio shonuf offed the three witches last summer
437626 you state under oath i should remind you that the accused actually helped you bring down the dragon slayer airship and thereby saved the town of chunderland from certain disaster
437627 so what about the fact that he burnt down his aunties house
437628 do you believe that it was a deliberate attempt to murder his auntie
437629 had your friend zack not shoved his plasterers trowel through the stud wall of his aunties house would you consider the possibility that zack might have found some other means to cause the demise of his auntie crud
437630 i think the questions fair it shows state of mind
437631 well he could have put her head in the mangle
437632 wouldnt you have placed her head in the mangle rather than burn down her house while she was out shopping i mean its obvious isnt it
437633 im not having that blankensdorft git getting all the credit for what my horatio did
437634 everybody knows it was horatio and his two time duplicates who saved the dragon slayer i mean its all on video tape isnt it
437635 i couldnt believe it so ive brought it with me to prove that i wasnt dreaming
437636 my brother professor desmond squealch invented a time machine that brought two duplicate horatios from the future the resulting merging of the time lines means that he forgot how to make a time machine and the rampaging moth had its dna altered by a time storm and reverted to its caterpillar state
437637 certainly there was no sign of the accused there of course ill run this tape through some extremely complicated algae rhythms in our experimental bio yoghurt computer to see if i can find any sign of a plasterers trowel but im pretty certain on this preliminary evidence that zack blankensdorft wasnt there
437638 it was when i visited the penitentiary i tripped on some cheesecake just inside the door of the waiting room i then fell into tattys lap its all on video tape too tatty took it before he left ive seen it im all covered in cheesecake and rolling about in his lap it makes me look like some sort of evil pole dancer or dairy product deviant he said that if i didnt lie in court hed send this to my school and ive never even heard of oral sex
437639 the part about horatio giving me oral sex was accurate i mean is it likely that i would leave cheesecake just inside the door of the waiting room i mean its ridiculous isnt it scandalous absolutely unthinkable
437640 first of all id like a cup of tea then i think we should go save brutus from the church of the painted privates
437641 i used to be a member myself excuse the puns come on
437642 ill tell you what were going to do nothing absolutely nothing
437643 at least not for a couple of weeks i know prince rupert reasonably well i can get brutus out with just a careless wink of my eye but lets not hurry lets make him stew a while then when hes back to his old self again well set him free hey maybe well spend a while comparing tattoos

437700 it seems that drug eradication efforts serve only as price supports for dealers now who could have seen that coming
437701 altering the drug users behaviour and potentially setting up violent drug gang conflicts as police move dealers from one area to another
437702 this is something we do in almost every large state to make sure were not just obsessed with the large urban areas where democratic voters traditionally turn out but that we reach out to areas that are not traditionally democratic that have a lot of republicans and independents
437703 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
437704 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
437705 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
437706 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
437707 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
437708 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
437709 the challenges of terrorism must be overcome in order for us to realize the potential of greater regional integration greater economic integration
437710 this terrorism is certainly one of the issues which for us is a very important part of the issues in the summit

437740 is effectively the only thing standing between zuma and the presidency and his defence team has exploited every legal avenue to weaken it
437741 further it would be improper for commentators to press for any particular outc ome of the application by zuma in the high court in pietermaritzburg on monday to review the decision by the npa to prosecute and to set it aside
437742 i am not one of those weak spirited sappy americans who want to be liked by all the people around them i dont care if people hate my guts i assume most of them do the important question is whether they are in a position to do anything about it my affections being concentrated over a few people are not spread all over hell in a vile attempt to placate sulky worthless shits
437743 the decision is basically a formalisation of the reality because unmee has really not been on the ground
437744 both countries do not want to go to war but the situation is very sensitive and the troops are close to each other
437745 the mission was sent at the request of both countries to keep the peace after a two year war claimed at least 70 000 ethiopian and eritrean lives
437746 it was a difficult mission in geographically harsh locations but the men and women who served did not flinch
437747 the secretary general expresses hope that the parties would be able to break the current stalemate and create conditions necessary for the normalisation of their relations which is key to peace and stability in the region
437748 there is no clear mechanism for engagement at the moment
437749 ethiopia has a firm stand that the conflict between ethiopia and eritrea ought to be solved through peaceful means
437750 unmees presence was really symbolic it was not a peace enforcement force it does not have the capability of deterrent so its not going to have any impact
437751 legally ethiopias occupation of eritrea is untenable it cannot be accepted by the international community i think our focus has been on the legal end and the diplomatic dimensions of the issue
437752 both regimes have used it as an excuse to enhance their domestic power at the expense of democracy and economic growth thus reducing the attractiveness to them of diplomatic compromise
437753 they support the others domestic rebels and each is convinced that the fall of the others regime is imminent and the only real solution to the border dispute
437754 we have got to move away from these beautifully choreographed speeches which appeal to groups of voters who are unassailably in the obama camp already
437755 what plays well with the educated liberal voter sometimes grates with the blue collar folk whom we need on our side if we are going to win
437756 even on his worst day bill clinton was able to signal that he understood voters concerns and that he felt their pain
437757 obama has no trouble with the campaign stagecraft but this isnt harvard its the beer hall he has to talk in language that people understand
437758 i have become a symbol of restoring america to its best traditions
437759 look obama has pulled off a good tour of europe and it was probably necessary
437760 what we need now is campaign events in hospital emergency rooms and in unemployment offices and small town diners these people have a vote
437761 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
437762 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
437763 the mdc believes that no amount of tinkering with currency denominations will address the zimbabwean crisis
437764 as long as there is no production we will continue to move in circles as a country

437777 i expect there will still be some profit growth but it will be modest
437778 across the board it may be around 3 or perhaps even lower down towards zero
437779 when you look through the sectors there will be some difficult reports ahead
437780 a few companies may do well but others will struggle we certainly wont have the benign reports weve become used to over the last few years
437781 we expect the 2007 08 reporting season to be downbeat rather than disappointing
437782 low confidence in the economy and lower house prices has resulted in people pulling in their belts a bit
437783 over the next six months consumer spending will remain tight
437784 there is a slowdown i mean we were going very strong with 12 or 13 or 14 growth up to december
437785 then january to june was more like 1 2 3 4 5 growth and going forward from july december and 2009 doesnt look that good at the moment
437786 i think there will be greater focus on outlook comments than in recent years and i suspect that many of those statements will be pretty cautious
437787 there was a consensus among analysts that there would be strong profit growth in the 2008 09 financial year of up to 10 but that will have to be reconsidered now as these company comments will pour cold water over those expectations
437788 for the majority of the past financial year there wasnt a big increase in volumes or commodity prices but costs did rise especially in the bigger resources

437796 is not something we can merit or achieve but only receive as pure gift
437797 prayer is pure receptivity to gods grace love in action communion with the spirit who dwells within us leading us through jesus in the church to our heavenly father
437798 in case of the continuation of a downward trend in oil price one of the serious discussions in the next opec meeting will be definitely the quotas
437799 opec as the responsible body to control the market should be more meticulous for the control of quotas
437800 the member countries that have increased their capacity should control it the issue is that some countries have been supplying more than their quota

437899 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god being justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in christ jesus whom god displayed publicly as a propitiation in his blood through faith this was to demonstrate his righteousness because in the forbearance of god he passed over the sins previously committed for the demonstration i say of his righteousness at the present time that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in jesus
437900 for while we were still helpless at the right time christ died for the ungodly
437901 for the love of christ controls us having concluded this that one died for all therefore all died and he died for all that they who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died and rose again on their behalf
437902 who gave himself as a ransom for all the testimony borne at the proper time
437903 for the grace of god has appeared bringing salvation to

437926 but israel pursuing the law of righteousness has not attained to the law of righteousness 32 why because they did not seek it by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling stone
437927 for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and seeking to establish their own righteousness have not submitted to the righteousness of god 4 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes
437928 the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight

437931 the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god has been preached and everyone is pressing into it
437932 now i say that jesus christ has become a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promises made to the fathers
437933 jesus answered most assuredly i say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god
437934 and he said to them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
437935 if anyone does not abide in me he is cast out as a branch

437940 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the holy angels with him then he will sit on the throne of his glory
437941 he who believes and is baptized will be saved but he who does not believe will be condemned
437942 then peter said to them repent and let every one of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit
437943 a certain ananias a devout man according to the law having a good testimony with all the jews who dwelt there
437944 now why are you waiting arise and be baptized and wash away your sins calling on the name of the lord
437945 but in every nation whoever fears him and works righteousness is accepted by him
437946 believe on the lord jesus christ and you will be saved
437947 by one spirit we were all baptized into one body
437948 there is also an antitype which now saves us namely baptism
437949 for christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of no effect
437950 but we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us
437951 there is one body and one spirit just as you were called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism
437952 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy spirit whom he poured out on us abundantly through jesus christ our savior
437953 but we are bound to give thanks to god always for you brethren beloved by the lord because god from the beginning chose you unto salvation deliverance from the tribulation through sanctification of the spirit and belief in the truth
437954 for god did not appoint us to wrath but to obtain salvation through our lord jesus christ
437955 so serious a sacramental doctrine would need stronger support anyhow than this disputed portion of mark
437956 that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein
437957 to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing
437958 i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing while really it should be mourning that it is
437959 for ye know not what hour your lord doth come
437960 when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth
437961 the lord my god shall come and all the saints with thee
437962 let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you that where i am there ye may be also
437963 when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality
437964 to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord
437965 not that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life
437966 if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee
437967 if i will that he lives till he dies what is that to thee
437968 went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die
437969 looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said
437970 three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures
437971 work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ
437972 turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god
437973 for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words
437974 we who live to the end of the next century
437975 shall be caught up to meet the lord in the air
437976 i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed
437977 the trumpet shall sound and we shall be raised incorruptible and the living shall be changed
437978 now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time apart from sin unto salvation
437979 now once in the end of the world hath appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
437980 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
437981 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into judgment
437982 and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light
437983 we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body for we are saved by hope
437984 predestinated to be conformed to the image of gods son
437985 received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father
437986 shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
437987 we which are alive and remain shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the lord in the air
437988 for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ who shall change our body of humiliation that it may be fashioned like unto his body of glory
437989 let your moderation or yieldingness be known unto all men the lord is at hand
437990 the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great god and saviour jesus christ
437991 blessed hope thus mentioned is the same to which such frequent reference is elsewhere made
437992 whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
437993 into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ
437994 the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer
437995 behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book
437996 behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be
437997 but unto you i say even unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have hold fast till i come
437998 behold i come quickly hold fast that which thou hast that no man take thy crown
437999 whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service
438000 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry
438001 yet a little while and this scene will close death will put an end to your troubles and you will depart to be with jesus which is far better
438002 be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord
438003 behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain be ye also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh
438004 if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee
438005 out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
438006 by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind
438007 for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the lords death
438008 there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand is years and a thousand years as one day the lord is not slack concerning his premise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night
438009 jehovah hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee ask of me and i shall give thee the gentiles for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessel
438010 and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white homes clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god
438011 what age are these armies of heaven and of whom do they consist
438012 the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth
438013 the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of saints
438014 take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed
438015 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful
438016 sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called according to gods purpose
438017 he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father
438018 saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints to execute judgment upon all
438019 the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day
438020 waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of the body
438021 that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us
438022 for the earnest expectation of the creature or creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god
438023 be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of god
438024 ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory
438025 it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him
438026 waiting for the revelation see margin of our lord jesus christ who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ
438027 that we are your rejoicing even as ye also are ours in the day of the lord jesus
438028 that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ
438029 may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ
438030 that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither laboured in vain
438031 without spot unrebukeable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ
438032 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing
438033 for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming
438034 when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory
438035 unblameable in holiness before god even our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints
438036 the appearing of the glory of our great god and saviour jesus christ
438037 abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming
438038 that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is
438039 every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure
438040 the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us
438041 the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ
438042 gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ
438043 servant whom his lord made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season
438044 blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him off and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
438045 watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour
438046 let your loins be girded about and your lights burning and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve them and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants
438047 in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is not aware
438048 the night is far spent the day is at hand let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof
438049 and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants
438050 taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
438051 be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
438052 father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am my glory which thou hast given me
438053 concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent anticipate them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words
438054 this we say unto you by the word of the lord
438055 i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you
438056 by revelation he made known unto me the mystery which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men
438057 by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent
438058 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air
438059 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed
438060 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hades delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hades were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
438061 and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and of those which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years
438062 sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
438063 he that overcometh and keepeth my words unto the end to him will i give power over the nations
438064 them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him
438065 the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment
438066 judged out of those things which were written in the books
438067 that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust
438068 they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that neither marry nor are given in marriage neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection
438069 through or in jesus the resurrection from among the dead
438070 that the christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead
438071 who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is passed already
438072 if by any means i might attain unto the the dead
438073 in his own order christ the first fruits afterward they that are christs at his coming
438074 judged every man according to their works and death and hades
438075 at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever
438076 let both wheat and tares grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn
438077 he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age not world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this age the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father
438078 what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the age
438079 break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potters vessel
438080 gather all nations and will bring them down unto the valley of jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage israel whom they have scattered among the nations
438081 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all the nations
438082 before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad
438083 we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ
438084 his eyes as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass
438085 every one of us shall give account of himself to god

438224 i think its important to be honest that youre pregnant said mrs giblin who lives on sydneys north shore with her husband
438225 im not ashamed of it but its made finding a job very difficult
438226 were young and we need a double income to have the baby pay off the mortgage and bills it all adds up
438227 i think some employers are insensitive i dont think they have any understanding of pregnant employees they need guidelines
438228 hiring someone who is pregnant brings additional complications for them
438229 they look for who can do the job now if the person is leaving on maternity leave in a couple of months and somebody else is there rather than starting all over again they might say this new person has some advantages
438230 a lot of employers regrettably still look at this as something which is detrimental to their business mr kerkyasharian said
438231 this mentality of employers is very damaging and belittling to women it makes women feel that theyve done something wrong by being pregnant
438232 even with qualifications behind you businesses get nervous that youre going to leave them when i would actually feel very grateful and would want to return to work part time after the babys born she said

438235 the public response to sam newmans latest outburst shows that most people appreciate how stupid and shallow his comments are
438236 he just wants to attract attention it cant be anything else and i dont think he is going to change she said
438237 it seems as if he is in pursuit of infamy and if thats the case perhaps he should be taken off air people find him offensive and inappropriate

438254 meanwhile the national government has clawed indigenous affairs off the states and territories and might as well be making all the decisions in this area
438255 its hard to see much autonomy left in health policy for the states after the current review being conducted in canberra
438256 apart from police the one area where they are likely to continue to have real autonomy is in land use planning implementing capital city plans controlling rivers and native vegetation running most national parks making forestry decisions

438271 es war zuletzt nicht leicht aber so ist das eben das n chste mal versuche ich es wieder

438273 timos runde in q2 war wirklich extrem gut aber in q3 ist auch nichts gr eres schief gelaufen wir sind sehr zufrieden
438274 heute war ein extrem schwieriges qualifying denn die reifensituation war berhaupt nicht klar kein reifen ist deutlich besser also haben wir versucht in den einzelnen sessions teilweise mit beiden reifentypen zu fahren um alles abzudecken
438275 bei timo konnten wir es uns sparen in q2 die options zu fahren weil seine zeit schon schnell genug war
438276 das war ein hartes und anstrengendes qualifikationstraining doch am ende war alles gut startplatz eins besser geht es nicht ich bin sehr gl cklich ber meine erste pole position in dieser saison und freue mich vor allem f r mein team das diesen erfolg verdient hat
438277 meine zeiten mit dem ersten satz reifen waren nicht so gut daher haben wir ein paar details an der fahrwerkseinstellung ver ndert mit dem zweiten reifensatz lief es dann richtig gut morgen machen wir dort weiter wo wir heute aufgeh rt haben dann klappt es mit dem zweiten saisonsieg
438278 ich hatte eine sehr schlechte runde mit meinem zweiten satz reifen wenn man zwei gro e fehler macht hat man momentan eben keine chance im supercup ganz vorne zu stehen die konkurrenz ist enorm stark aber selbst wenn ich fehlerlos geblieben w re gegen damien h tte es heute nicht gereicht er hat alles richtig gemacht und war unglaublich schnell unterwegs gl ckwunsch
438279 am anfang des qualifyings dachte ich dass ich schon schnell unterwegs bin allerdings fuhr ich mit dem ersten satz reifen nur auf platz zw lf beim zweiten versuch habe ich mich nochmals voll konzentriert und meine leistung auf den punkt gebracht jetzt bin ich super gl cklich dass ich bei meinem elften einsatz im porsche auf dem dritten startplatz stehe wenn morgen erneut eine podiumsplatzierung dabei rauskommt w re es sehr sch n
438280 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
438281 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
438282 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
438283 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
438284 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
438285 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
438286 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
438287 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
438288 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
438289 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

438404 google spilled part of its intentions by announcing its virtual world or more appropriately virtual room the company launched lively by google earlier this month lively by google would be a natural vehicle for googles adsense for games product which could insert ads into the rooms of users in fact others expect it to be a proving ground
438405 all of the companies know the potential of the market advertisers are turning to in game ads because its one of the only ways to reach young male gamers who have stopped watching tv the yankee group predicts the market will be worth 971 3 million by 2011 googles top executives know that search advertising may not last forever and in game advertising could become a compelling technology over time as both games and in game ad technology become more and more engaging google would cover its bases by making a small side bet on in game ads

438409 when were going over an idea you can simply go over and see what youre learning
438410 were not worried about it were actually were trying to push it forward as fast as we can we open sourced the second life client with the hope that it would get generalized by the different companies and types of people that are using it uh as quickly as possible into a you know a standardized an approach to immersing yourself as a with a client in a 3d world as possible
438411 i think that you know as a company were probably a little bit ahead of that curve because were trying to anticipate the future and trying to anticipate the standards process on say uh making avatars you know accounts interoperable between virtual worlds open sourcing the software so people can extend it if anything i think the only argument you can make at this point is that maybe we were just early to be doing that but i think long term without that kind of an open standard that you know the internet has already happened people know how this movie goes and so if virtual worlds are going to become the 3d version of the internet theyre going to absolutely have to be open uh and opened up and standardized extremely fast
438412 virtual worlds to achieve the immersive properties that are key technologically to the experience they create require a piece of client software in the same way you know that you had to download mosaic and netscape in the early days to experience the internet i so but i think that the problem of say getting those bundled onto machines or making that download very small and very easy is a very straight forward problem
438413 what about all those easily accessible 3d rooms embedded in browsers and facebook and whatever
438414 were developing standards and the technology will get easier to install
438415 the completely browser based ways of looking into the virtual world do not provide very much in the experientially and so its difficult you kind of have to look at use model to use model there are people today who have used the second life open source code and theyve actually written um for example chat based clients
438416 in a browser you cant render a 3d environment with sound lighting shadows the actual sort of world of warcraft like you know uh most people have seen that the real 3d rendered experience

438425 prime minister yousaf raza gilani said he would conduct an independent investigation
438426 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
438427 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
438428 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
438429 it also mirrors what we see about sexually transmitted diseases and changes in risk behavior among men who have sex with men
438430 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
438431 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
438432 it is important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the annual number of new hiv infections
438433 in fact cdcs analysis suggests that the epidemic has been roughly stable since the late 1990s though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
438434 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

438470 sometime this rain although it can be a blessing for the fire hazard it also can be a curse because it gives folks a false sense of security while we did get some rain we are still at a high hazard and with just a little bit of sunny weather we can bounce back quickly from that moisture so we need people to remember we are still at a high hazard and there still is potential for fires to spread out there

438508 i am delighted to be taking part in climate camp where better to highlight the governments failure to provide leadership on climate change than kingsnorth the proposed location for the first coal fired power station in britain for 30 years
438509 a new coal facility at kingsnorth would emit up to 8 million tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere each year and potentially keep doing so for 50 years that annual emissions figure is as much co2 as the worlds 24 lowest emitting countries combined
438510 despite all its climate rhetoric greenhouse gas emissions have risen under this labour adminstration any government which commits to more coal fired power stations and kingsnorth is only the start then claims to be aiming for a massive reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 is quite simply living in a fantasy land
438511 our political leaders seem unable to grasp a more radical social and environmental agenda they can no longer commit to endless free market economic growth which has played a huge part in the rapid generation of damaging climate emissions and then wring their hands about climate change
438512 the government should be showing real leadership in this debate with measures to tackle rising energy costs and fuel poverty as well as initiating major investment in energy efficiency renewables and decentralised energy
438513 instead ministers stick with their business as usual approach further enabling the fossil fuel industry to profit and pollute while paying scant regard to the average citizen or the environment

438522 i think it is important to pick him from his fingers because most of the variations which he does he does from his fingers and it is important to pick him from his fingers so far it is working well
438523 i hope it continues to be in this series it is difficult because they mendis and muttiah muraltharan have got lot of variations in their armoury you have to react to what they throw at you that is the best way to play against them we just cannot be pre determined against them
438524 so far in the test match we have really played well and i think it is for the bowlers to turn the series around
438525 it is going to be very difficult for the opposition if we can set anything more than 350 we can really set the game for us they have got a good quality attack in murali and mendis it is a good challenge for us
438526 i think anything above 350 is going to be a good target because the wicket is only going to deteriorate from here it is not going to be a very good batting track and specially when harbhajan and kumble in our armoury
438527 i think rahul dravid is a quality player i dont think i need to shield him he has got more than 10 000 runs they were bowling really well and applying a lot of pressure on us but there was never a conscious effort of shielding him at all

438541 fuimos pautados para estar a las 9 00 am del 16 de mayo de 2008 en el canal pero como no estuvieron disponibles los vi ticos bs f 23 para las tres comidas diarias terminamos saliendo a la 1 30 pm viajamos 17 horas y llegamos a las 6 30 am al campamento uribante caparo que quedaba a 4 horas del lugar del programa y que nos alojar a por tres d as

438543 dormimos 3 horas pues nos pidieron estar en el lugar de transmisi n antes de las 7 30 am
438544 nos dijeron que por motivos ajenos a venezolana de televisi n ya no se realizar a la transmisi n
438545 est bamos desayunando y nos toc comenzar a desmontar todo el set debido a las malas condiciones de las carreteras y al incesante mal tiempo tardamos siete horas m s en recoger todo hasta las 4 00 pm de ah salimos al hotel cacique en el estado barinas pasamos la noche y partimos a caracas a las 7 00 am arribamos a las instalaciones de vtv a las 7 00 pm del lunes 19 de mayo
438546 el exceso de horas no las producen los trabajadores sino la mala planificaci n
438547 el minci no tiene ese r gimen de horas extras la productora tampoco porque a ella le pagan por programa nosotros s y perdemos mucho tiempo por ejemplo en traslados tratando de llegar a lugares distantes
438548 si hubiese una mejor administraci n del tiempo y de los recursos generar horas extras no ser an tan intenso es una cuesti n de coordinaci n y de administraci n no pueden culpar a los trabajadores

438551 the point is that this is where the rubber meets the road
438552 this is where you stand in your homes in your churches and in your schools and you teach rebellion against god thats the whole point of that play that laramie project has no function but to teach rebellion to your people
438553 the play teaches rebellion against god and the standards of god and takes your people to hell and brings great wrath upon you
438554 those are all pretty compelling reasons for not liking it
438555 she said its the first time the westboro baptist church will visit red deer but theyve protested the play dozens of times before
438556 i believe everybody is entitled to their opinion i think they have just as much right to express how they feel about the play as we do to put it on
438557 what i dont agree with is their tactics i think they go a little too far when they condemn canada the nation to hell because of a play like this and when they go around to peoples funerals and they slam this in the face of people who are obviously grieving
438558 what the laramie project does is it forces us to examine ourselves and what our beliefs and opinions are and how we might be consciously or unconsciously contributing to the cycle of hate and violence
438559 so at the very least it provokes that discussion but with the westboro people coming down here i believe that will just resonate more strongly
438560 i think what we need to do is make it very clear that their hate and their ignorance is not welcome in red deer and it is not a part of what we believe
438561 here is how you do that you dont hate them in your heart but you dont suffer their sin upon them
438562 if youre not warning them that their sin is taking them to hell then you hate your neighbour in their heart and you have not loved your neighbour as yourself
438563 their interpretation of the scripture and how they choose to manifest that interpretation is a disservice to the christian gospel of gods grace grace means unmerited favour and unmerited love to all human beings who are all sinners
438564 the westboro baptist church members seem to attack the person and dont have an understanding of their own unrighteousness
438565 when you find a penny thats grandpa saying i love you

438570 it is time that we realize that the pursuit of narrow national interests and pursuit of militant terrorism cannot serve any long term purpose
438571 one of the most useful and universal window managers available window maker has a reputation for being fast efficient and highly stable and is very popular among open source solutions for use on both newer and older machines as with most window managers it supports plenty of available themes
438572 on all the evidence that i have seen the risks associated with allowing this cross bred cat into the country when we already have up to 12 million feral cats wreaking havoc on native fauna are simply too great
438573 that is why i have banned the import of these cats immediately
438574 the submissions i received during the public comment period were overwhelming in their support to stop the importation of the savannah cat
438575 of the 549 submissions received 526 supported the proposed amendment
438576 the result is fewer people wasting their money on ineffective treatments
438577 we wont have a doctor whos prepared to trek around to peoples homes
438578 a life spent in crime is really a life wasted
438579 when they thought they saw smoke coming from the back of the aircraft
438580 the pilots would have had a warning from the flight management system
438581 the pilot decided to return to sydney they flew out over the ocean to dump fuel because they were overweight for landing
438582 air traffic controllers received a call from the pilot declaring an emergency and proceeded to give priority clearance for a landing at sydney there was no safety issue at any time
438583 has been shown to slow the progression of joint damage in osteoarthritis
438584 there currently is no good evidence that any australian preparation works although there is some evidence overseas that one might
438585 it really is an indictment of the australian regulatory system that a product that is so popular and has such a high market share of complementary medicines has not been properly evaluated

438587 then midway through the first quarter were going to start to get a look at some of our younger guys and guys we want to see i would say its probably likely that the offense will play a bit more than the defense
438588 it probably will be plays i havent really decided how many yet but it will definitely be by plays and we will discuss that prior to todays practice
438589 jim sorgi will play a little bit more than peyton manning normally would have played we wont necessarily have all the first offensive group in with him all the time he will get his share of work

438591 i could hardly walk couldnt walk on stairs i couldnt cycle i couldnt bend down i didnt realise my joints had deteriorated that much in that time
438592 i had to admit that perhaps there was something in this weird herbal remedy ive stayed on for the last 12 months with no intention of going off
438593 if its too cold it has no aroma beer should be 10 to 12 degrees celsius the same as sausage
438594 i think its a shame and i know therell be a lot of women who will be devastated because what its going to do is encourage more outrageous and inappropriate fashion
438595 if women are going to be judged on how fashionable or on trend they are then i think youll find a lot of older women and the women who like to wear classic racewear just wont bother entering any more and its a pity because these are the women you love to see who know how to do that really ladylike racewear thats so beautiful
438596 i suffer for my art so that you dont have to
438597 i think theres something special that comes out of seeing somebody out of their comfort level out of their world having to confront their own beliefs
438598 the things i do the places i go are places 99 9 of people are never going to go talking to people 99 9 of us are never going to talk to
438599 every tv station every newspaper all the journalists were saying why havent we found this guy hes taunting us again why havent we brought him to justice
438600 we thought thats a great question about two months into working on it we found out my wife alex was pregnant and the film took a real shift because then it became not just about where is he and why havent we found him but what kind of world am i about to bring a kid into
438601 when the import duties were first put in place it was a very different situation
438602 we need to turn the tables so were giving consumers incentives to buy more efficient lower cost cars than gas guzzlers
438603 thats the notion of climate change everything is like that theres a great many things that have to change there isnt one big magic bullet
438604 if petrol is cheap no policy aimed at imposing fuel efficiency is going to go anywhere
438605 we need to make sure we dont cave in to populism on the petrol price front and let the price mechanism do its work once youve got the incentives there people will switch to a more efficient vehicle
438606 reform of the fbt is of much greater importance than import duty
438607 the government must remove the incentive to do that june run up the coast when people get in the car and do that few hundred kilometres to get it over the next threshold its a very strange and perverse way of structuring a tax incentive
438608 the government would lose out on tax revenue but would benefit in many other ways
438609 this project would give the government a carbon benefit an infrastructure saving and a health benefit in one stroke
438610 its the closest thing we have to a silver bullet
438611 it is finished minister well our bit of it is it will just take a bit more time for the private operators to fit it out
438612 if it wasnt so serious for the people of daylesford i would consider taking my bathers down there and proving that it is not finished because there is no water and no bath
438613 from the point of view of the delivery of this project it has been done
438614 the new operator though obviously wants to fit the premises out to his own standards and configuration and will open the spa house following that fit out
438615 if we wait in a rank for 30 minutes and then get a short trip from one end of collins street to another it is not financially feasible
438616 a 10 flagfall would make it more lucrative to do short trips a lot of drivers dont want to take them thats why they stick around at the airport
438617 i think its the right thing the right ball park
438618 we would offer qualified support qualified in that we havent actually done the numbers ourselves
438619 it would discourage them from making those sorts of trips

438628 i had no idea of the effect my decision to leave would have on my family
438629 i thought well theyve had their life i want my life
438630 my parents were really god fearing people we had to love god and go to church
438631 they were so strict we werent allowed to knit on sundays you werent allowed to ride your bike on sundays basically you had nothing to do on sundays but go to church
438632 we would pray before meals pray after meals read the bible after meals they were loving parents but their whole life was about bringing up their children to believe in god
438633 i wouldnt have said boo to my parents whatever they said you did you didnt dare disobey
438634 the second kevan mentioned the president as having gone behind his back that was it his days are numbered we will be looking for a new press chief
438635 i believe the states and territories should be given greater capacity to make decisions on what skills are most needed in their economy to fill critical skills shortages
438636 aligning migration with the labour needs of certain states would recognise the reality that australia is a combination of regional economies the skills needed in the north west of wa are very different to those needed in victoria or tasmania
438637 currently deliver a single national skilled migration program that will meet those regional variations just as importantly there should be an increasing role for employers in determining the skill mix that is delivered by our migration programs
438638 we are short in a whole range of skills areas from professionals such as doctors and engineers through to welders

438651 i had to think very carefully about what our needs were but also we were moving to a neighbourhood and to think about how to have the least impact on our neighbours so we werent clogging up their roads
438652 knife crime is a huge issue both empirical and anecdotal evidence support that
438653 we thought we were on the cusp of getting something done then bang we were just shut down
438654 we were dogged in continuing this project and its needs
438655 we were becoming a nuisance i have to assume there was something about the way we were being dogged and properly demanding these things that was annoying people
438656 if you believe that australia is heading in the right direction dont put that at risk by changing the government because when you change the government of this country you do change the direction in which the country is heading
438657 people dont see it any more if everything begins with i people edit it out
438658 i bet i can find a million ppl that want smoking back in pubs
438659 there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taliban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of pakistan we need to identify these people and weed them out
438660 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
438661 at least 40 quid a night for special branch officers to risk their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa
438662 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
438663 he is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
438664 we didnt want to come out and pour fuel on the flames but i think its got to a point where we have to make some sort of response

438669 peter costello has devoted his life to arguing for extreme industrial relations laws
438670 is a bloke who said workchoices didnt go far enough
438671 as a large group that does not rely on the reiv for its training and support but rather for its portrayal and leadership of the industry we believe this incident does little to support that notion of value for its fees
438672 we believe it is the role of the reiv to challenge the long held negative stereotypes of agents doing wrong things by the public we expect the reiv to typify the principles of ethical conduct at all times
438673 they deceived buyers into thinking they could have bought the property for 3 01 million

438700 contradicciones en materias muy sensibles para nuestros intereses estrat gicos

438702 qui n maneja la pol tica exterior no se sabe a ciencia cierta pero s es evidente que las expresiones carentes de toda diplomacia del presidente en algunas ocasiones han hecho quedar muy mal parado al ministro de relaciones exteriores aunque ste pareciera no darse cuenta
438703 cooperaci n comercio e inversi n son los principales intereses de un pa s civilizado pero lo que ortega est haciendo va en contra de estos intereses estrat gicos
438704 pero a esta fecha no veo que el gobierno haya logrado ese objetivo
438705 la pol tica exterior de la actual administraci n es mucho m s consistente y abierta a los beneficios del pa s que las pol ticas de las anteriores administraciones las anteriores fueron excesivamente sesgadas y sometidas a la voluntad de estados unidos

438714 this butterfly is retreating higher up the hillsides as the warmer weather makes lower habitats unsuitable
438715 the fear is that as climate change continues this rare species will run out of mountain and become extinct in scotland
438716 there are already parts of scotland harbouring butterflies that have become extinct in england and the largely unspoilt landscape found in the uplands is an increasingly important habitat
438717 it is essential that we find out exactly what is hiding in the hills

438791 im young im new to the national scene obama said
438792 the one thing we know about the team that john mccain has assembled because its a carry over from some of the folks who have worked on the bush campaigns obama said at a press conference at cape canaveral fla
438793 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
438794 i want to talk about how were going to put more money in peoples pockets

438796 we have some of the biggest challenges that certainly ive seen in my lifetime
438797 confidence that the determinant factor in the election will be voters deciding who has the answers
438798 its not really clear what this is based on if i were presumptuous i wouldnt be working so hard im beat
438799 i think the american people as a whole are watching this this week and saying what does this have to do with me
438800 we get four or five shots in a row assertions by mccain that i would rather lose a war so that i can win a campaign that i am not willing to visit the troops that i somehow am full of myself that im an empty headed celebrity whatever repeated attacks have been launched this week so when i say boy those are kind of silly arguments the press says isnt that being negative
438801 ultimately what i think weve got to do is keep driving home the essential message of this campaign that weve got to change business as usual
438802 this notion that somehow i was playing the race card is ridiculous what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before which is i dont come out of central casting when it comes to what presidential candidates typically look like and it doesnt just have to do with race it has to do with my name it has to do with my biography and my background it has to do with our message of change
438803 i dont think its accurate to say that my comments had nothing to do with race
438804 im young im new to the national scene obama said
438805 let me be clear in no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist obama said
438806 i am absolutely confident that the people in union mo or jacksonville florida or any other town in the country at the end of the day are going to be making the decision based on what is best for their lives
438807 what i was saying was we cant drill our way out of the problem
438808 what that means is if we want to have true oil independence true energy independence then were going to have to become more efficient obama said
438809 what i said was what ive seen so far from a so called gang of 10 energy bill which several senators are promoting has some of the very aggressive elements that he wants to see in an energy plan
438810 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling positions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful as you might expect from a drilling agenda what i dont want is for the bad to be the enemy of the good

438932 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it

438961 ich verlor in jedem der sektoren ein wenig zeit und konnte nicht das gewisse etwas finden denn in der kurvenmitte war meine geschwindigkeit zu niedrig
438962 es ist mit sicherheit von platz 13 schwierig aber der gro e preis von ungarn kann unvorhersehbar sein wir m ssen also abwarten

438965 the boyfriend grabbed a knife and stabbed the woman repeatedly in her chest neck and back
438966 the incident happened on a balcony of a unit in the first floor it is then alleged that the boyfriend ran up to the seventh floor and jumped
438967 im totally disappointed it looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way i was hoping it was so obvious he would be penalised right away and i could still get into q2
438968 though the administration has often been portrayed as divided over military options against iran an official denied there are now any sharp rifts
438969 there is uniformity across the u s government about the way to proceed with iran
438970 everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
438971 when there are new governments in israel and the united states and a volatile presidential election scheduled in iran for now the united states and its allies including israel seem willing to pursue the diplomatic track but if that doesnt work and there are no signs yet that tehran is willing to bend all the deadly options will remain on the table
438972 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
438973 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
438974 every one of us knows how important water is to everything that we do in california
438975 this is why it is important that we work and fight for water for our farms for our families to our environment to our future to our developments to our businesses and the list goes on and on and on
438976 our farmers are cutting back and letting fields sit empty because they cant guarantee adequate water
438977 developments cant move forward prices are going up on water and we are now water rationing all over the state of california
438978 as food prices skyrocket farmworkers will not be able to find work and there will be more hardship because there is not enough water
438979 we need more water in the san joaquin valley and across california
438980 the turnout here today of farmworkers local government officials and others who are part of the farm economy is a clear demonstration that the shortcomings of our water supply system are hurting more than just farmers
438981 farm communities in rural california are suffering including farmworkers schools and those who supply inputs to and buy products from farmers
438982 lawmakers need to act now to enhance surface water storage in our state
438983 buy local will become the buzz phrase of the past if we do not act to preserve the dwindling family farms and ranches that are under pressure as fuel and fertilizer costs rise and water becomes too scarce to take the risk to plant a crop that you may not be able to secure water for
438984 im here because people need to keep working and because of the water we are losing
438985 a lot of people dont have work because theres no water and no crops if theres no water they cant do anything
438986 the other half lost their jobs because theres no water theres no jobs theres a lot of people that are not here because they are not working for us anymore its a really unfair call but the only thing i know is theres nothing for them to do
438987 we believe there is a concern so this is a good cause to support
438988 it would be wonderful if we could get some storage built so that we can supply all the needs for the people for agriculture and for the environment that should be our goal to be sustainable here in this state
438989 theres no redeeming features to drowning mexicans or law enforcement
438990 it should be safer its going to be here another 100 years

438996 non approviamo gran parte delle misure italiane impronte digitali non su base etnica e ai bambini solo con il consenso dei genitori anche la romania deve migliorare nel campo dellintegrazione
438997 basescu deve promuovere progetti di integrazione e programmi di educazione del popolo romeno allantirazzismo i fondi ue vanno usati con maggiore efficacia ed necessario che basescu e tariceanu evitino affermazioni intolleranti
438998 parte o gran parte delle misure prese dal governo italiano
438999 preoccupazione che alcuni cittadini romeni in italia possano essere discriminati
439000 riguardo ai rom il presidente romeno ha riconosciuto che anche in romania le politiche di integrazione e i programmi di lotta al razzismo vanno resi pi efficaci ma alcune sue espressioni riguardo alla minoranza rom devono essere chiarite per evitare che siano strumentalizzate dalle organizzazioni razziste
439001 relativo alla minoranza rom abbiamo proposto in questa sede al governo italiano di collaborare al fine di risolvere questo problema che noi non siamo stati capaci di risolvere a casa nostra
439002 che nonostante alcune apprezzabili iniziative rivolte allintegrazione delletnia rom in romania il presidente basescu come il suo predecessore iliescu negazionista del samudaripen lolocausto del popolo rom si spesso distinto durante la sua carriera politica per affermazioni lesive dei diritti umani del popolo rom lo stesso ha fatto in diverse occasioni il primo ministro calin popescu tariceanu e vero che basescu ha rinnegato il suo passato e si impegnato a condurre politiche antidiscriminatorie ma nessuno ha dimenticato in romania linsulto razzista che qualche tempo fa il presidente rivolse a una giornalista rom che gli aveva posto una domanda imbarazzante
439003 chiedo a basescu a nome dei rom romeni stanziati in italia
439004 di spiegare le affermazioni rese ieri durante la conferenza stampa congiunta con il premier italiano berlusconi basescu ha affermato che esiste un problema rom in romania ed vero ma deve essere chiaro che si tratta un problema di segregazione e di programmi di integrazione inefficienti il governo romeno
439005 ha ricevuto fondi consistenti dallunione europea ma la condizione dei rom resta di estrema indigenza ed esclusione in romania non esiste una situazione di persecuzione come in italia ma il pregiudizio contro i rom ancora vivo e i miei fratelli sono ancora cittadini di serie b
439006 hanno compiuto sforzi importanti per abbandonare una vecchia mentalit dettata da ignoranza e pregiudizio e guardare alleuropa dellaccoglienza dellintercultura e dei diritti umani ricordiamo loro tuttavia che i rom nel suo paese hanno subito sei secoli di schiavit e persecuzioni oltre alla tragedia dellolocausto che ha sterminato centinaia di migliaia di bambini donne e uomini rom ecco perch non vorremmo sentire o leggere mai pi da parte loro frasi rivolte ai rom come queste non vogliono integrarsi sono indisciplinati non possibile scolarizzare i loro bambini e necessario cambiare la loro indole chiediamo a basescu di spiegare quali misure intende adottare nei prossimi tempi per integrare i rom nel suo paese e per accogliere i profughi che rientrano in patria fuggendo la persecuzione in italia
439007 e gli ricordiamo che il governo romeno ha il dovere di realizzare programmi di integrazione rivolti ai rom e programmi di educazione allantirazzismo rivolti al popolo romeno troppi fondi dellunione europea e troppa demagogia sono stati sprecati chiediamo anche al presidente della romania
439008 di ascoltare le migliaia di testimonianze di rom romeni fuggiti dallitalia verso spagna francia grecia romania riguardo alle innumerevoli gravissime violazioni dei diritti umani avvenute in italia e di prendere una posizione chiara contro il razzismo e la persecuzione che colpisce ancora migliaia di cittadini rom romeni nel nostro paese

439109 i think were faced with such an enormous problem that we need to do all the research we can to see if there are any geo engineering proposals which work through to the marketplace
439110 we wont have anything that we can bring into place in 2030 say when suddenly the world is at a crisis point
439111 they could buy the aircraft and buy the rockets and just start doing some geo engineering off their own island
439112 we need to make sure that there is control and validation over any of these procedures but at the same time lets not take attention away from the major issue of removing our dependence on fossil fuels
439113 investments in geo engineering research are almost certainly the biggest bang for the buck that one could get in terms of addressing catastrophic climate change a much much bigger return than for example trying to control carbon emissions at the moment
439114 in fact diverting money into controlling carbon emissions and away from geo engineering is probably morally irresponsible

439129 infections are typical if the woman chooses to not have an episiotomy some simply dont believe its necessary what they dont realize is that the tissue is ripped apart during birth anyway and it can often tear longer and asymmetrically this not only causes the mother greater pain but also precludes the healing process

439469 in whats become a bit of a regular occurrence in this campaign senator obama once had a different position on offshore drilling and its clear why he did it would have long term consequences for our coastlines but no short term benefits since it would take at least ten years to get any oil well the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of senator obamas original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices tomorrow it would not lower gas prices this year it would not lower gas prices five years from now in fact president bushs own energy department says that we wont see a drop of oil from his own proposal until 2017 and in fact you wouldnt see any full production out of any oil drilling off the coast until 2030 it will take a generation to reach full production and even then the effect on gas prices will be minimal at best so let me just repeat barack obamas proposal george bushs proposal to drill offshore here in florida and other places around the country would not provide families with any relief this year next year five years from now believe me if i thought there was any evidence at all that drilling could save people money who are struggling to fill up their gas tanks by this summer or the next year or even the next few years i would consider it but it wont and barack obama knows that the fact is senator obamas decision to team up with george bush on offshore drilling violates the bipartisan consensus that we have had for decades that has protected floridas pristine coastline from drilling

439570 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
439571 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
439572 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
439573 it also mirrors what we see about sexually transmitted diseases and changes in risk behavior among men who have sex with men
439574 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
439575 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
439576 in fact cdcs analysis suggests that the epidemic has been roughly stable since the late 1990s though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
439577 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

439620 lawrence springborg is one of the longest serving mps in queensland but i have never known him to stand up and hold firm on any tough issue
439621 being the premier of queensland requires personal qualities that i have never seen lawrence springborg demonstrate
439622 after 10 years of the beattie bligh government they have no record which they can be proud of these are the first shots of a dirty campaign that will be waged against the lnp
439623 it would be a big mistake if i or anyone in my team took any encouragement from a slight movement in the polls
439624 queensland is at a critical point of its development it needs strong decisive leadership it needs backbone

439681 let me be clear in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
439682 i think they were cynical and i think they want to distract from talking about the real issues
439683 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
439684 the one thing we know about the team that john mccains assembled is that theyre very good at negative campaigns theyre not so good at governing
439685 its not really clear exactly what its based on if i was presumptuous or taking this for granted i wouldnt be working this hard this week im beat
439686 obviously we think were in a tight race and we think this is going to be a close race all the way through
439687 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest we think its got a lot of humor in it and were having fun and enjoying it
439688 its been a pretty decent weekend the pace of the car is great i think its a great day to have me and heikki 1 2 its about time we did that
439689 kovalainen is pushing me hard but thats a good thing
439690 we didnt seem to be very strong this morning but looking at the lap times from the first two sessions i think we are there

439692 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
439693 its not just that the pipeline hasnt produced a gusher but that its falling to a trickle we cant continue on the road were traveling its scary the system is heading toward some sort of cusp
439694 it was mind boggling because it went completely against what we had expected to see happening
439695 once we figured out what was happening however the results were very clear
439696 in the past many believed that cell specialization or differentiation was a terminal state there was no going back or getting young again
439697 but now not only do we know this reversion happens naturally we also have a very tractable genetic system in which to study it
439698 i had about four different hypotheses to explain why i couldnt see any of these cells crossing the dorsal trunk
439699 it took quite a while to convince ourselves what was truly going on
439700 to find two very different kinds of progenitor cells in a single fruit fly tissue raises the possibility that there may be more than one kind of adult stem cell in mammalian tissue
439701 it may be that organisms use both quiescent undifferentiated cells and more highly differentiated yet reversible facultative stem cells under different conditions
439702 although it wasnt expected drosophila have clearly taken advantage of this biological capacity during metamorphosis
439703 the stem cell community is debating whether every mammalian tissue relies on conventional adult stem cells of the sort already identified in bone marrow and muscle or if instead there are facultative stem cells that can arise from differentiated cells within the tissue now we know that it doesnt necessarily have to be one or the other it could be both
439704 for next years 30th anniversary of being there we found more than 10 minutes of deleted scenes and alternate endings that no one has seen before and were putting that only on the blu ray version
439705 the standard def version will be at a lower price but we are really trying to trade people up to blu ray we are seeking out our assets that we can apply to blu ray to encourage consumers to step up
439706 it should be the best selling set that weve ever done on blu ray
439707 we want to keep adding to the format and bd live gives us this whole new ability to reinvigorate attraction to the title
439708 i think at the absolute minimum blu ray customers should get at least everything thats available on the dvd release
439709 after you put in high def audio and video since that is the focus you might not have as much space on the blu ray as you did on a standard def two disc special edition
439710 we really take a good better and best approach with our product assortment
439711 single is good two disc better and the blu ray should always be your best product it might not include everything from the standard dvd but it should be considered the best product
439712 while you might think gamers purchase fewer movie discs than others we didnt see any significant evidence of that in our results
439713 ps3 console shipments will go a long way to help bring down manufacturing costs and drive down blu ray player prices
439714 other forms of entertainment are going to run you 40 50 60
439715 theres a great deal of value renting a movie for less than 10 you can rent two movies and have some snacks buying the movie is close to 20
439716 for sure the kiosk channel is gaining mass acceptance among consumers
439717 dvd rental transactions from the kiosk footprint have helped offset transactions lost by chains shuttered bricks and mortar locations kiosks provide a convenient way for consumers to interact and control their own rental price point this is especially appealing in a slow economy
439718 given the way the industry has been headed i think this is good
439719 i think on the whole with gas and food prices rising peoples open dollars are limited rental has been and always will be a cheap form of entertainment
439720 three for two helps give you a presence on the shelf
439721 with warner you had a studio who said they were not caring about rental and its all about vod and sell through
439722 it took us two years to break even on dvd
439723 now we have a signal protein that can support the microenvironment for hair development and maybe also for hair renewal
439724 laminin 511 acts at the crossroads between cell compartments helping the cells communicate
439725 there are a lot of different causes of hair loss
439726 injecting laminin 511 into the skin might under some circumstances promote hair growth
439727 our finding that laminin 511 stimulates primary cilia formation was pretty surprising
