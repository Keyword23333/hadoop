5970016 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5970017 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5970018 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh

5970030 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5970031 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5970032 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened

5970201 it is pretty obvious that the label change in 2007 was not adequate
5970202 we believe that amylin possessed data prior to the 2007 label revision that justified a stronger and more prominent warning than the precaution language that amylin ultimately negotiated with fda

5970218 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
5970219 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
5970220 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
5970221 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed
5970222 but if mr harper calls an election mr dion said the campaign would open with opposition allegations that the prime minister cannot be trusted since hes breaking his own fixed election law
5970223 this enactment amends the canada elections act to provide that subject to an earlier dissolution of parliament a general election must be held on the third monday in october in the fourth calendar year following polling day for the last general election with the first general election after this enactment comes into force being held on monday october 19 2009 the enactment also provides that the chief electoral officer may recommend an alternate day if the day set for polling is not suitable
5970224 the tuesday immediately following the monday that would otherwise be polling day or the monday of the following week
5970225 in canada the governor in council is the governor general acting on the advice of the federal cabinet
5970226 the process is set in motion when the prime minister requests the governor general who represents the queen as the head of state to dissolve parliament and to request the issue of writs by the chief electoral officer for an election the government must retain the confidence of a majority of the house of commons or tender its resignation
5970227 no house of commons and no legislative assembly shall continue for longer than five years from the date fixed for the return of the writs of a general election of its members
5970228 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately mr dion has indicated that the government should be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position i think polls do indicate that the next election in all likelihood would be a minority one way or the other the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government needs a new mandate thats a decision thats an analysis ill have to reflect on ill have to talk to some of the other parties but whats absolutely clear from the comments of all three opposition leaders including mr dion is that they have no intention of respecting the fixed election date so obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding i think weve had a productive two and a half years i do think that has slowed somewhat in recent weeks i will take the next few weeks do a thorough evaluation of the situation and ensure one way or another we can have a productive parliament in the future
5970229 majority of the house of commons it must tender its resignation

5970277 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business

5970356 pixeling with my joystick on a black and white tv
5970357 i think there were a few reasons i started drawing everything on a black background not just on the megadrive first back in those days i drew most of my gfx on a black background i just liked that you could get away with a lot of stuff by fading it into darkness its also quite handy when youre dealing with systems like the megadrive which didnt give you much memory to play with i also prefer to draw to blackness because the contrast on the megadrive system was insane if i would have anti aliased everything to white i would have probably gone blind

5970371 this proved a less intractable problem because the leaders of the alliance realised the practical necessity of giving the malays a handicap if they were to compete on equal terms with the other races the only point of controversy was the duration of the special position should there be a time limit or should it be permanent i made a suggestion which was accepted that the question be left to the malays themselves because i felt that as more and more malays became educated and gained self confidence they themselves would do away with this special position because in itself this special position is a slur on the ability of the malays and only to be tolerated because it is necessary as a temporary measure to ensure their survival in the modern competitive world a world to which only those in the urban areas had been exposed

5970384 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car supt cotter said in parramatta today
5970385 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5970386 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5970387 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5970388 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option supt cotter said

5970418 we are fortunate enough to have a loyal and loving clientele who have evolved with us over the years and allowed us to do what we love
5970419 the arrival last year of chef sean marshall to matterhorn lifted this restaurant from good to excellent it is now not only a premium destination in wellington for a great time but also for seriously good food
5970420 a tuna sashimi style starter left us moaning for more such was the intelligence of the combined ingredients and quality of the fish
5970421 ultimately it was a dining tour de force from go to whoa with energy wit and a superb sense of its own identity stunning produce unpredictable combinations fresh thinking and thorough craftsmanship were the hallmarks of every dish
5970422 fresher better tasting food that has no need of too much work or excess garnish
5970423 dear god we place this marriage and this divorce in your hands heal our hearts dear god and heal our children we release each other in love and we bless each other forever help us to forgive the past to see the beauty and innocence in ourselves and each other we thank each other for the good times and forgive each other for everything else may nothing in the past except its blessing remain with either one of us we thank each other for the many gifts and vow to hold them in our hearts forever in this moment may our relationship be reborn to serve this new season of our lives may your holy spirit guide us and bless us all the days of our lives so be it and so it is amen
5970424 caro professore forse lei non conosce la differenza tra fare e sperimentare
5970425 irrilevante se lo sputo avesse o meno attinto la preside ed anche se la difficoltosa salivazione del professore dovuta alla foga nella discussione ne avesse reso lesecuzione pi problematica resta il fatto che sputi vi erano stati ed erano stati indirizzati alla preside mentre il professore diceva la sto profumando togliendo ogni dubbio su possibili qualificazioni alternative del proprio gesto
5970426 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
5970427 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
5970428 why are you asking the same question cant you come up with your own ponderings
5970429 when i can be okay with the contraction in myself i can accept the contraction in people around me when im okay with both then my life is simply a life lived in love
5970430 you cant create a new reality for yourself by continuing to beat the drum of what is you have to start telling a new story for yourself or nothing will ever change
5970431 well id like him to be at least a little spiritual
5970432 when you are clear what you want will show up in your life and only to the extent you are clear

5970434 what is your intention in saying what you have to say
5970435 the other day i had an interesting idea an interesting thought
5970436 i wonder what would change if i had to listen every night to everything i said that day
5970437 if you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all
5970438 det r en fr jd att vara n ra leoparder

5970447 the long family knows many of those injured personally and the young man who was sadly killed had worked on our farm for the last three summers our thoughts are with his family and loved ones and also with those others who have been seriously injured
5970448 he was a good guy weve had him here for three or four years
5970449 we send our sincere sympathies and condolences to all involved and the families of the deceased and injured
5970450 to cope with the needs of more than six million indebted consumers who are losing homes at the rate of 2000 a month and 6000 cars a month
5970451 the debt crisis is so serious that many more are needed being in debt is like suspecting you have a terminal illness
5970452 sometimes people become so frightened of the potential diagnosis they delay going for help until its too late with everything physical health or financial health the earlier you go for help the better the chance of a happy and successful outcome
5970453 one client tried to commit suicide three times and his psychologist would call from hospital and ask us to speak to him and assure him that we had his debt situation under control
5970454 for some their salaries havent kept up with inflation or someone in their family became very ill or they lose their job and then the people who gave them easy credit start hounding them
5970455 he is a physical corner and he loves to hit he hits hard
5970456 dont look at him and think he is not going to get in on you he will
5970457 it might be kind of deceptive but he will play you as tough as anybody
5970458 he likes to get in there and get dirty with players and real physical
5970459 at times he reminds me of antoine because antoine liked to get physical they like to jack the receivers up
5970460 to be a good corner you have to be good at technique if you want to play i learned from one of the best in antoine
5970461 i didnt play because he was here but you cant get too mad you knew he was going to play i just tried to learn as much as i could
5970462 i can play the run game good because at my position you need to come up and hit
5970463 hi im your neighbor i dont want to startle you but my goats are in your driveway
5970464 yes we are going to touch on that very thing in just one minute
5970465 make a bowl of cereal and watch little bear and give me 30 more minutes of sleep pleeeeeeease
5970466 we were so impressed with the water filter on a number of levels cost quality and product so we decided to offer this product to the world
5970467 there are a number of things that people should realize about their water
5970468 take the impurities from your bathing water drinking water or your cooking water
5970469 our business presents a water purifier that comes right into your tap after it goes through your purifier instead of going through the pipes in your house and picking up impurities i believe that this water purifier is a healthier choice
5970470 one of the things we like about the blog is the ability for us and other people to see the water filters out there
5970471 we want other people to talk about why our water filter has the best quality and how we can clearly outline that
5970472 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
5970473 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
5970474 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
5970475 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5970476 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
5970477 hopefully itll get better in a few weeks and go from there
5970478 surgery is definitely not on my lifetime check list so i dont want to end up going under hopefully i can get back on the field in a couple of weeks
5970479 today when i woke up i could actually sit up in bed rather than roll out the side and fall on my face
5970480 its not 100 percent that hell be ready but its not 100 percent that hell have an operation
5970481 weve got that in between those two weeks to find out
5970482 snobbery is innate in those who believe they have the smarts
5970483 but it also manifests itself as racism generalising of course so perhaps youre different because youre perfect but hardcore gamers love japan they consider it their homeland dream of being on first name terms with shop owners in akihabara of high fiving the teddy boys in shinhuku park of local noodle bars and overpriced alcohol of tiny japanese girls treating them like david beckham of being an accepted gaijin it is utopia and it is the home of the best videogame makers in the world
5970484 otaku isnt a good term you know it means unhealthy obsession its not glam different interesting its dirty pathetic lonely
5970485 but we let japan get away with it because hey theyre a different culture and its all a bit of fun and theyre exotic and exciting and we are head over heels in love with them
5970486 redeye doesnt believe that the japanese are really any better at making videogames than the west just that they happen to have made some of the best and that mediocre games of theirs appear exotic and interesting to us and that makes them more than mediocre
5970487 a land of invention christ ea has nothing on the seuquential habits of the japanese capcom taito beloved nintendo enix all companies who thrive on squeezing franchises to within an inch of their commercial lives and square square is the worst
5970488 redeyes been reading a lot of ill educated comment recently about western design and most of it seems to be rooted in cultural snobbery
5970489 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5970490 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5970491 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5970492 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5970493 well just try to match up the best way we can
5970494 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5970495 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5970496 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5970497 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
5970498 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
5970499 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
5970500 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done
5970501 i always wanted to play pop warner football but i was a chubby kid
5970502 i was a little bit too big to play with the kids my age so i needed to wait until high school
5970503 im just excited to be playing football im having fun
5970504 i feel like i had to take my lumps in the beginning
5970505 it was tough out there because i was going against bigger stronger and more experienced guys
5970506 i think its really helped me in the long run its taught me to fight through things and i can deal with the adversity
5970507 he comes out here every day and works his tail off trying to get better hes not so much trying to do big plays during practice but hes one of the more technically sound guys on the team
5970508 i was just ecstatic a walk off at the little league world series
5970509 not many kids can say they played at the little league world series playing against the top teams in the united states
5970510 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
5970511 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
5970512 i like the fact that theyre taking it slow because a hamstring is the kind of thing that you definitely dont want to have linger throughout the season
5970513 that kid is a really good looking hitter with power
5970514 its important to do this in advance and be prepared
5970515 the social media stuff is probably the most important we do today from a marketing stand point the other elements of marketing mix has sort of become more and more transactional and more and more tactical in nature social media stuff is much more strategic use social media to power the fundamental of the business thats what were focused on
5970516 to see the tigers trainers and the surgeon is going to come in today and check me out one more time i look at this as they want me to get another checkup the medical stuff is going great
5970517 we worked on where my hands start in my stretch delivery
5970518 what you do in the very beginning can dictate a lot of what happens at the end the purpose is to get my arm a little bit more free
5970519 my timing was off a little bit and i was yanking some pitches
5970520 the previous two starts i felt pretty good about it
5970521 when i said granderson might catch crawford for the league lead i didnt mean tonight
5970522 support nigeria iraq and others seeking to overcome security constraints on increased production
5970523 stolen crude should be treated like stolen diamonds because they both generate blood money
5970524 its a job for the nigerian navy and thats the problem
5970525 the problem for the nigerians is that there are too many people involved in the stealing of oil
5970526 the corruption of the militias so that theyre in effect not rebels for their people but oil thieves cutting deals with local officials makes it extremely difficult to get the parties together to talk about a settlement
5970527 look at some of the very large projects the super majors are involved in and there is no guarantee that simply having a large player in the joint venture removes the risk to origins shareholders
5970528 many of these large projects are late and substantially over budget and this applies to the big international companies as well as anyone else
5970529 because we have the skills and experience of delivering these projects substantially better than our competitors
5970530 we have come late to the lng process but our reserves are unparalleled
5970531 the alternative to bgs offer is highly complex and nobody least of all origins shareholders will know for seven or eight years whether they have been successful in striking the right balance of risk and reward
5970532 the atari brand has stood for innovation and pioneering spirit for more than 30 years we must recapture what made atari an iconic brand we will focus our efforts on established franchises new major motion picture licensed ip with significant marketing campaigns
5970533 the perpetrators threatened the driver at gunpoint and ordered him to drive to the pay point where they alighted and began firing shots
5970534 the gang then stole a pensioners car and fled the scene the vehicle was abandoned a short distance away
5970535 like meret oppenheims fur lined teacup it lends a mystery to the daily makes something new out of it
5970536 this time in relation to the news about malaca angs support for the amendment of the charter to support changing our form of government from a republic to a federal one to our surprise and delight
5970537 its monday night football i think a lot of guys might go out there and get some jitters but i felt good felt comfortable it was fun
5970538 d a is fine i talked to him and hes doing ok
5970539 anytime you get hit in the head the medical people are very cautious about concussions and head injuries
5970540 i think anybodyd be excited if they were in a backup position and got a chance to start
5970541 you have big fast defensive players who want to take your head off
5970542 when youre the quarterback youve got to prepare yourself for that sometimes stuff like this happens
5970543 it was awesome to get with the one offensive line
5970544 you see how nice it is but our twos did great as well
5970545 he had it in his hands it was just instinct to knock it out of his hands and i just thank god that i was able to do that and help brady out in that situation
5970546 i think i helped myself in the situation ive been in
5970547 at the same time its up to the coaching staff to make a decision on me all i can do is go out there and play football and show em that i can do what im able to do
5970548 thats the one thing that myself my family the browns and the fans should be happy about it could have clipped the tendon but it missed and was just a laceration as opposed to a tear
5970549 i am not one that believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanors
5970550 i think that the right response is hard headed engagement
5970551 recent speeches from miliband have laid out much stronger european credentials than some of his predecessors ever would have wanted to
5970552 you did see a significant degree of unity with all ministers supporting a package of practical and political support for georgia
5970553 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car supt cotter said in parramatta today
5970554 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5970555 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5970556 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5970557 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option supt cotter said
5970558 significant rattled by the shooting but would not give any further details
5970559 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5970560 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5970561 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5970562 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5970563 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5970564 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5970565 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5970566 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5970567 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5970568 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
5970569 he had his own setback if he really wants that no 1 spot he has to earn it back and take it from ray ray is the one with the first group
5970570 maybe hes just trying to save tuioti mariner or maybe im really the starting right guard
5970571 the whole entire year i was learning to play tackle
5970572 they kind of threw me into the fire at guard at first it was tough because guard is a whole other position
5970573 he needs a lot of reps but hes getting better every day
5970574 if i do im going to mess up i want to focus on myself and what i want to get done and what i need to work on every day
5970575 in the next few days well have a set offensive line
5970576 hopefully well also be healthy we still have a couple of guys dinged up and thats delaying it

5970580 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
5970581 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
5970582 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5970585 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5970586 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5970587 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5970588 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

5970596 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5970597 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5970598 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5970599 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5970600 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said

5970614 politics in western australia is always very close ive always believed that we could lose the election dont be under any misapprehension
5970615 a relatively small number of people can decide they dont want you any more

5970617 in my view this is an appropriate circumstance in which bail should be issued
5970618 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5970619 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5970620 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5970621 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5970622 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5970623 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5970624 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5970625 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5970626 i think its going to be challenging but i think its all doable she said
5970627 there a whole mix of transport that i use to get around the electorate now so ill continue to use that mix she said

5970632 our inspector was following routine procedure for securing the aircraft that were on the tarmac
5970633 i will speak here about the matter for the last time i want to ask for your understanding that i am working for the benefit of the country and for our former prime minister
5970634 my party colleagues want me to explain to the party and im ready to talk to everyone if you see that i can no longer do anything to help the former prime minister i will do whatever you like and i will consider my political future
5970635 they just want to photograph someone who rarely attends party meetings
5970636 people were really upset when an arrest warrant was issued for thaksin they asked the mps who simply relayed this concern to the party leader
5970637 the mps just want to ask the party leader to protect thaksins human dignity and his status as a former prime minister it is not for thaksin himself
5970638 whats probably impressed a lot of people or shocked a lot of people and i dont know why but hes been playing solid defense
5970639 the other night he did a phenomenal job on dirk nowitzki people try to criticize him about that but hes been doing a phenomenal job defensively for us
5970640 we know how it is to come on a team like this with 12 of the best players in the world and not have to score 30 points a night we dream about the day that we can play on our own nba team and not have to score 30 a night and hope to get a win
5970641 they play 44 minutes every other night its hard to play that many minutes in three or four games a week and play both offensively and defensively its very difficult all of these guys when you watch them theyre putting most of their energy on the offensive end thats what their teams need here we dont need that
5970642 we know that we can score the ball better than anybody out there in the world but if we dont stop nobody on this team we dont win
5970643 im ready to kiss the record goodbye if he keeps on doing what he has been doing
5970644 i used to think 19 32 was untouchable now i think it is touchable
5970645 he has it in his legs he is a force of nature a one in a million runner
5970646 im going out there and run my heart out and anything that comes comes but right now its kind of hard
5970647 ive been through four rounds of the 100 and three of the 200 so its kind of hard to go out there and get the record
5970648 im definitely going out there hoping i can win both but the 200 would mean a lot more to me
5970649 just because you can run the 100 doesnt mean you can run the 200 run too fast at the start and youll be tired at the turn
5970650 given that hes not the most technically sound 200 meter runner
5970651 when hes gassed he still covers more ground than a lot of short people
5970652 he has the advantages of a small man and a big man
5970653 with the explosiveness and stride frequency of a short runner and the stride length of a tall one
5970654 drei w nsche auf einmal das geht nun wirklich nicht

5970656 i always dreamed of being a doctor to study here can make that possible there are more teachers and instruction
5970657 there were lots of problems at my school in pattani when there is violence the school has to close for our safety this happens three or four times every term
5970658 ive seen rebels fire guns at my school the teachers and students scream my school has been closed many times
5970659 we live and study happily despite our different religion and culture
5970660 we hope they will be leaders teaching others in their home towns to understand they are not separate
5970661 there has been speculation that the tournament might be rescheduled and we understand in a technical sense that while it would be very very difficult to do that it would still be possible
5970662 thats one of the issues that wed be interested to hear their views on after they have their meeting today
5970663 weve got a great deal of sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the people over there but it is our job to advise our players over issues of safety
5970664 we just dont believe its acceptably safe for them to be going to pakistan for the champions trophy which is really disappointing because the players really want to play in the event but its just not safe from our perspective to be there at the moment
5970665 these winds are very dangerous this could generate a tornado

5970668 we havent been asked to provide him with any asylum or place of residence
5970669 if he tries to enter thailand we can arrest him detain him and deport him
5970670 but he has said he will not go to london
5970671 he doesnt want to go back to the uk because hes had so many troubles there already
5970672 he wanted to go to another country like singapore or hong kong
5970673 its not a done deal that he can go wherever he likes given his record
5970674 i would hope that the authorities would make sure that he does not slip off to another country
5970675 they rank right up there amongst the great stories of our olympic history
5970676 that was just sensational and so far as sally is concerned you know right out there with the very very best
5970677 i usually do have a great start out of the blocks and i did have probably an awesome start obviously last night but just being ahead of those girls at the start of the race was just fantastic
5970678 it was a great feeling and i knew something special was going to happen half way through the race and saw lolo go down i saw the whole thing
5970679 i just remember it really clearly and i felt for her obviously but as soon as she went down i just said go just run and i took my chance and i just went through the gap and here i am a silver medallist
5970680 i had one big rush of cold shiver go straight through my body
5970681 it really got me angry and i just said oh you are not getting away with this
5970682 we havent been asked to provide him with any asylum or place of residence
5970683 if he chooses to take up residence somewhere i mean if he were to request that we would obviously look at it but its not an issue that weve been approached with

5970732 we are assisting companies meet this challenge by developing e learning modules which incorporate highly effective engagement techniques and interactive scenarios so that users quickly acquire or refresh their knowledge on a particular system change management process or service launch said simon

5970850 nhs resources are not limitless and nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs

5970891 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
5970892 we are gratified by the citys decision to compensate these individuals whose targeted arrests were without probable cause and intended to quell future protest in new york city this lawsuit and this settlement vindicates our clients rights to assemble and speak their mind free from the fear that they will be punished for their views
5970893 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
5970894 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
5970895 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton we intend to continue our resistance until this stops

5970926 since launching in early 2005 paypal has always had ongoing dialogue with australias regulators and governing bodies and will continue to do so
5970927 we do not intend to speculate nor comment preemptively on what the outcome of these discussions might be
5970928 over recent months the payments system board has received a number of comments on the no surcharge and no steering rules that apply to payments using the paypal system as well as the mandated acceptance of paypal on ebays auction site
5970929 where no surcharge and no steering rules have existed in other systems the board has encouraged their removal on the grounds that these rules can diminish competition in the payments system
5970930 consistent with this the bank will shortly be holding discussions with paypal with a view to seeking the removal of these rules

5971036 the result is by far the most extreme reading since the inception of the asb housing confidence survey in 1996 reflecting expectations that a weaker housing market will continue for the rest of 2008
5971037 the improvement in buyer sentiment coincides with a marked swing in interest rate expectations from a distinct majority expecting higher interest rates to a more even balance between higher and lower rates
5971038 however respondents are increasingly downbeat on the outlook for house prices respondents might view some improvement in the ability to fund a house purchase but their outlook for house prices suggests they will be in no hurry to act

5971297 dbo2 safetynet has generated a wealth of information on safety performance and trending both for turner and our subcontractors
5971298 with dbo2 we have the ability to tie together 45 of our business units across the nation and to track subcontractor progress http dbo2 com portals 619 docs bp managing 20sub 20performance pdf in implementing turners safety program and our requirements above and beyond osha we have approximately 6000 ongoing projects at any one time and 280 full time safety professionals who have a lot of ground to cover dbo2 allows those safety professionals to really hone in on the subcontractors to create and raise awareness of our safety requirements and building l i f e living injury free everyday the instant reporting that safetynet offers enables us to make the right decisions at the field and operational levels
5971299 it felt like i hit the lottery that i was at the right place at the right time
5971300 but as i thought some more about it i believed it could truly have happened to any one of us in the course of walking our jobs and doing our best to keep each other out of harms way
5971301 over the last five years its just amazing how safetynet has caught on i know that the project executives meet on a regular basis to discuss observations whos making them and which jobs are doing better than others this information that we collect is something thats carried all the way up to the top and trickles back down
5971302 the five million observation milestone signifies engagement in the dbo2 safetynet system by everyone in our company
5971303 next we will focus on what people do with those nuggets of insight in order to continue to raise the bar on safety and loss prevention not only for turner but the industry as a whole were on the right track with improving the use of the system and extracting meaningful data that we can use for positive change
5971304 our entire team salutes turners commitment to using leading indicators to drive improved organizational financial and safety performance the dramatic and sustained positive results that turner has derived from using both leading and lagging indicators provides a glimpse at the new standard for risk and safety management
5971305 this is the soonest weve ever been able to provide initial reliability information on a new model year
5971306 and it clearly demonstrates the ability of our research process to provide information on new models far ahead of other sources with truedelta buying a new design no longer has to be a crapshoot
5971307 for other model years our data is over a year more recent than our primary competitors when considering a car do you want to know how reliable it was a year or so ago or do you want to know how reliable it has been recently

5971316 el prefecto de santa cruz rub n costas est en un proceso de franca conspiraci n y desestabilizaci n de la democracia en el pa s es algo as como un prefecto de la violencia y del insulto
5971317 es un prefecto que no ha entendido el resultado del refer ndum revocatorio del domingo y que no quiere ingresar en un proceso de concertaci n y de di logo
5971318 el gobierno va a seguir tendi ndoles la mano va a seguir proponiendo un di logo una concertaci n para resolver los problemas del pa s en el mbito m s pac fico posible
5971319 el objetivo pol tico que est n buscando es la desestabilizaci n del gobierno y el derrocamiento del presidente evo morales lo intentaron el 10 de agosto y no lo lograron por eso est n armando una estrategia para la divisi n del pa s
5971320 lo que est n buscando los prefectos derechistas es una especie de separatismo porque saben que sus privilegios se les acabaron y esos privilegios que ten an est n queriendo cuidar y har n todo lo humanamente posible y hasta lo imposible por preservarlos
5971321 la soluci n m s simple es que el presidente evo morales d un autogolpe cierre el congreso despida jueces nombre jueces por decreto y se proclame autoridad suprema con el respaldo de dos tercios de la poblaci n y vamos a la c rcel con toda la gente que hace eso yo creo que esa es la imagen que ellos quieren llevar adelante y que el gobierno no va aceptar ese reto
5971322 lamentablemente el mas fiel a su l nea reformista desconoce y no aplica las demandas contenidas en las agendas de lucha del pueblo boliviano manteniendo la pol tica econ mica neoliberal y ocasionando las crisis y problemas econ micos que son propias del modelo la inflaci n desempleo el hambre y miseria son flagelos de esa pol tica econ mica que vivimos durante d cadas desde que se impone el neoliberalismo a trav s del 21060
5971323 los acuerdos pactos y concesiones cedidas por el mas a la minor a olig rquica es parte de su pol tica de conciliaci n y entendimiento con el enemigo de clase utilizando el cuento de convertir en socios a los patrones
5971324 la experiencia de la asamblea constituyente y de la propagandizada revoluci n democr tica cultural que es la l nea del gobierno nos demuestra la imposibilidad material de lograr la revoluci n de manera pac fica alternativa practicada una y otra vez por el reformismo logrando s lo prolongar la agon a del capitalismo y mantener la explotaci n cruel de millones de trabajadores desocupaci n gigantesca y pobreza desesperante
5971325 no existe otra opci n que el de preparar las fuerzas del proletariado y del pueblo para una confrontaci n final y violenta contra la oligarqu a y el imperialismo ndr donde la victoria de los trabajadores y pueblo har n posible la construcci n de una nueva y verdadera sociedad de las mayor as

5971358 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
5971359 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
5971360 we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly longer than in a better functioning market
5971361 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time

5971368 there are 900 000 more people in severe poverty than in 1997 and child poverty has been rising for two years in succession

5971379 they are the most affluent lot among real estate buyers in india showing interest in buying large chunks of land in their home country they are not affected by the current slowdown as they take a long range view of the whole scenario they have faith in the indian economy and firmly believe that the prices will appreciate by at least 10 to 15 per cent every year they see the downturn as an opportunity to invest in large chunks of land or even developed areas which they get at a good discount from even the top developers
5971380 according to our assessment despite a slowdown in the last six months the interest of the nris has increased almost by 20 25 every quarter that is almost two to two and a half times in the last two to three years
5971381 many nris in the us and uk are not as confident as before of sanctity of their employment while others are disturbed by negative economic patterns across developed countries they see greater potential for india overcoming current economic setbacks sentimental attachment to their country of origin is another reason
5971382 the gulf nri is one who is bound to return nris are looking for decent returns and might think of holding property in india while investors from uk and usa are pure investors nris mostly have an affinity to the areas they come from
5971383 the property price upswing seen in the indian market has made nris very bullish about the indian real estate nri segment contributes to about 25 30 investment both for the end use and for investment
5971384 many nris have shown keen interest in luxury homes in places like khar bandra and powai due to their vicinity to the airport also there has been interest in projects in kandivali and borivali for many maharashtrians abroad pune is the preferred location for investment many a times a crisis situation in their country brings them to other countries for investment

5971395 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
5971396 the republicans have taken that first type of patriotism that muscular military rockets red glare type of patriotism and driven that as a wedge against people they see democrats liberals as weak on national security issues
5971397 i think the patriotism question in this case is being wrapped into this larger issue that hes not one of us

5971399 it showed that hed put a campaign victory ahead of a military victory

5971407 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion
5971408 we can see from examples of closures of several mosques over the recent years very strict control over religion and also arrests of activists as well as people accused of violent offenses

5971439 its a great achievement but as owners we see ourselves as facilitators its important to remember weve had some fantastic chefs
5971440 initially there was a lot of keeping tables open in the restaurant when we could have filled them with drinkers

5971451 east asia pacific regional preparatory meeting for the world congress iii against sexual exploitation of children and adolescents
5971452 progress has been made but the fact is that east asia and the pacific continue to be hot spots where large numbers of children are exploited
5971453 the regions governments need to take their anti exploitation efforts to another level and push through much tougher anti child sex measures
5971454 all countries are affected by these issues in various ways and there is no one approach that suits all
5971455 for example despite the focus being on tourists from abroad we should highlight that the majority of the offenders are local men
5971456 while acts of commercial sexual exploitation are acts of violence as well as violations of human rights they are not always treated as crimes
5971457 the need to criminalize such acts is stressed in all legal instruments and agendas for action on the commercial sexual exploitation of children

5971560 the board remains of the view that the general economic climate is not necessarily a driver for h amp ts business as the pawnbroking industry is not cyclical

5971574 sometimes i dont like people to see the man behind the curtain i dont like them to know that something wasnt awesome before they saw it
5971575 you know the things we had to tweak the things we had to cut that is inevitable
5971576 but now i dont think it is just us the whole world is so much about seeing behind the curtain and seeing how things are made and how they work and the extended cut and what we could have done and what we didnt do and the alternate ending and you just you kind of take it as part and parcel at the beginning

5971678 its clear that this is a wake up call not just to governments but to the community he said in sydney
5971679 we need to look at new ways new technologies and new methods to drive down these tragic figures
5971680 renovations are always more costly than new construction straight out of the ground
5971681 theres nothing that leads us to believe in any of his assignments that he conducted himself in anything other than an appropriate manner
5971682 weve known forever that for as long as peer to peer has been out there people have been misusing it to trade child pornography
5971683 truly staggering potential for australia as the world faced up to climate change
5971684 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix he said as he launched the fund in melbourne today
5971685 we could now see australias first commercially viable geothermal power plants in place within four to five years
5971686 he was the closest thing i have had to a brother and we were best friends all through elementary and high school
5971687 he was silly and goofy and he could make anyone laugh
5971688 to say that we miss him is just such an understatement
5971689 he was so loved by us and we all just assumed that we would grow old together
5971690 he was a hard worker and a real quiet guy with a good sense of humor
5971691 he had a great smile i just keep thinking about what a great smile he had
5971692 we hadnt been in contact for years when he asked me to write the letter and i did
5971693 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5971694 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5971695 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5971696 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5971697 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5971698 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5971699 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5971700 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5971701 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5971702 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
5971703 when i read the initial claims about david they just didnt ring true that a simple country bloke who had a decent family should become a supporter of terrorism
5971704 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide

5971711 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car supt cotter said in parramatta today
5971712 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5971713 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5971714 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5971715 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option supt cotter said
5971716 significant rattled by the shooting but would not give any further details
5971717 as more and more information on people becomes available on the internet through posting on personal blogs myspace facebook and other social networking web sites the internet has in the last few years become an important tool for jury consultants and trial lawyers
5971718 such sites are a treasure trove of information about potential and seated jurors that can be used in picking the right jurors bouncing potential jurors and even influencing jurors through the trial and in closing arguments

5971732 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5971733 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5971734 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5971735 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5971736 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5971737 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5971738 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5971739 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5971740 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5971741 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5971742 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5971743 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5971744 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha

5971782 listen sometimes your dad can look pretty much look like a dumbass if he doesnt pay attention to what he puts on now i could look at him and say hey you look like a dumbass or i can say hey theres a spot on that shirt why dont you go change which would you rather someone said to you
5971783 because doing that will cause more crashes and deaths because kids will be drinking
5971784 sweetie i drank more before i turned 21 than i have since i turned 21
5971785 because i was a dumb kid and i wasnt supposed to so i did
5971786 thats true it doesnt make it right but thats how it goes kids even you rebel now i want you to think about something for me when you turn 18 you get to vote and help decide who becomes the next president you can sign up for any branch of the military at 18 and get trained on how to go to war but you cant drink now do you think that if you are considered responsible enough to vote and to sign up for the military you should also be considered responsible enough to drink
5971787 ok now i want you to also think about all the kids that parents tell them to call them if they drink so they dont drive but the kids are too afraid to get into trouble so they dont instead they decide they arent that drunk drive home kill someone do you think that just maybe if it were legal that they might indeed call someone to come get them because they wouldnt get into trouble then
5971788 i guess but that doesnt mean i have to think its a good idea
5971789 no you dont have to think its a good idea but you do need to look at all the evidence from other countries that have lower drinking ages and less accidents and alcohol related deaths you also have to take into consideration how it makes sense to be able to vote and not be able to drink before you take a stance you need to look at everything and not just your personal feelings just because you dont like something doesnt make it wrong it just makes it not right for you

5971792 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5971793 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5971794 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5971795 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5971796 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said
5971797 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5971798 i thought it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have on mr rudd
5971799 as i say if i was to have my cvs on other leaders fall off the back of trucks you would all have a lot of laughs as well

5971811 is a period during which they students gather information about institutions of higher education
5971812 the choice set is the group of institutions to which students will actually apply
5971813 students discovering and evaluating possible colleges in which to enroll
5971814 students move to the third phase of the college enrollment decision choice
5971815 student choice and economics of education theorists have long documented the factors that influence the decision making process of students but one rationale why these models and programs have failed to increase the participation in higher education might be a lack of understanding how these models and programs would work within the african american culture
5971816 are attracted primarily by practical concerns program availability convenience close to home and work

5971899 i hold the prime minister personally responsible for the damage that is about to be done to the nation and to the integrity and dignity of the malays
5971900 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
5971901 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
5971902 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
5971903 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
5971904 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day said fouzia if they release her the truth will come out
5971905 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
5971906 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
5971907 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate

5972343 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
5972344 the republicans have taken that first type of patriotism that muscular military rockets red glare type of patriotism and driven that as a wedge against people they see democrats liberals as weak on national security issues
5972345 i think the patriotism question in this case is being wrapped into this larger issue that hes not one of us
5972346 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5972347 it showed that hed put a campaign victory ahead of a military victory
5972348 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose

5972359 it has become increasingly and enticingly clear that our bodies are outfitted with an array of stem cells
5972360 according to several research articles published in just the last month adult stem cells may have a far more immediate impact on regenerative therapies than first imagined
5972361 certainly none of these reports is the final word on stem cell research but they each in their own way show how our understanding of the bodys capacity to heal is moving forward one small often molecular step at a time
5972362 the incredible promise of stem cell research to at minimum advance scientific understanding and perhaps ultimately to treat persons with devastating diseases gives moral force to efforts to conduct this research

5972370 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates

5972452 our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
5972453 we must have a definite and vivid realization that god is bending over us and listening as we pray in much of our prayer there is little thought of god our mind is not taken up with the thought of the mighty and loving father we are occupied neither with the need nor with the one to whom we are praying but our mind is wandering here and there throughout the world when we really come into gods presence really meet him face to face in the place of prayer really seek the things that we desire from him then there is power
5972454 in prayer it is better to have a heart without words than words without a heart

5972473 hindi ako naniniwalang two lang marami namang kinds of guys sa mundo eh
5972474 for this conversation lang if you had only two choices which one would you pick
5972475 hindi talaga hindi ako makakapili or wala none of the above iba pa diyan yung gusto ko
5972476 ganon eh kung pwede yun eh di sakin pareho na lang ok lang naman pareho eh

5972478 in fairness apat kayo at nakuha nyo lahat ng permutation ng sagot
5972479 ikaw hindi mo sinabi kung alin sa dalawa yung gusto mo

5972483 i think this is my teams idea of a joke
5972484 okay lang yan sa simula lang naman yan magiging at home ka rin eventually
5972485 meron ka na bang copy ng song mo or gusto mo tumugtog na lang si jeff
5972486 eh ano ba yung song mo baka alam na ni jeff
5972487 so ano hindi mo talaga kayang tugtugin yung song niya
5972488 okey lang kasi yung songs nung iba kasi medyo common na marami nang rendition so matutugtog ko na nang maayos pero yung say it again
5972489 di ka ba pwedeng magpalit na lang ng song iba na lang kantahin mo
5972490 ha eh yun na yung pinaka bagay na song sa boses ko eh
5972491 ows imposible singer ka eh dapat marami kang songs na alam kantahin
5972492 nagkukunwari kang di marunong para ma underestimate ka nila hustler ka pala eh
5972493 eh kung hindi ka singer eh anong ginagawa mo dito
5972494 ill leave it to you to decide either i convince mo siya na tugtugin yung song mo
5972495 or i convince mo siya na palitan yung song niya
5972496 naisip ko lang kasi ngayon kailangan ko pang problemahin yung song ko eh hindi naman talaga ako yung dapat na contestant namin in the first place
5972497 kasi yung isang teammate namin naka leave siya for two weeks so ayun no choice ako na lang yung sinali nila pero hindi talaga ako yung dapat i mean substitute lang ako
5972498 isnt it enough that im already singing one song i have to sing another one as well
5972499 okey lang yan just go with the flow mas madali nga pag ganito eh kasi parang choir magble blend lang yung voices kung magkamali ka di masyado halata unlike kung solo na wala kang excuse
5972500 nahihirapan pa rin ako hindi ko naman talaga ginagawa to eh
5972501 well lahat naman yata tayo newbie dito eh so wala kang dapat ipag alala
5972502 alam mo mabuti pala na nag leave si clarissa tama ba kasi kung hindi di hindi kita nakilala

5972508 hintayin na lang kita 1 hour na lang pala eh
5972509 okay ill go downstairs and try to wait for you but if you go down later and dont see me that means ive gone ahead okay
5972510 alam mo ikaw wala ka talagang bilib sa sarili mo
5972511 wala namang ibang contestant na mag gigitara eh lahat sila minus one o kaya ako yung accompaniment so kung tumugtog ka di extra points ka na agad
5972512 ano ba sabi ko diba sabi ko walang ibang mag gigitara
5972513 okey eh di kung ganon tayong dalawa lang mag gigitara and since hindi ako contestant unique ka pa rin
5972514 alam mo ikaw nakikinig ka ba sabi ko tuturuan kita diba

5972529 no 757 hit the pentagon due to the heavy promotion of that idea but theres no actual evidence
5972530 what hit the building may be important however our focus should be on why it was hit in the first place
5972531 the 9 11 report in chapter eight says that in the summer of 2001 the government ignored repeated warnings by the cia ignored and didnt do anything to harden our border security didnt do anything to harden airport security didnt do anything to engage local law enforcement didnt do anything to round up ins and consular offices and say we have to shut this down and didnt warn the american people you bush knew they were in the united states you were warned by the cia you knew in july they were inside the united states you were told again by briefing officers in august that it was a dire threat and what did you do nothing so far as we could see on the 9 11 commission now thats in the report and we took an oath not to talk about it during the campaign i think correctly so to increase the capacity of that commissions report to be heard by the peoples congress
5972532 leaked by daniel ellsberg published by the new york times and later made into a book proved the dod was lying about their illegal escalation of the conflict in vietnam the gulf of tonkin incident never happened but it was still used to justify war with vietnam showed the joint chiefs were willing to deceive and even kill americans in order to create a pretext for invading cuba
5972533 very likely or somewhat likely that federal officials either participated in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon or took no action to stop them because they wanted the united states to go to war in the middle east
5972534 some people in the federal government had specific warnings of the 9 11 attacks in new york and washington but chose to ignore those warnings
5972535 kaya ko naman yan eh next time ka na tumulong pag may mabigat akong dala

5972540 im sure si jeff pumayag agad sayo na tutugtog siya nun
5972541 tulungan mo na lang ako i convince si jeff na tugtugin yung say it again mas gusto ko pa yun
5972542 haha ganon so talagang mahirap pala baguhin isip mo once nag decide ka na
5972543 oo kasi hindi naman ako gumagawa ng decisions nang hindi ko pa talagang napag isipan eh so once nag decide nako yun na talaga yon naisip ko na yung mga angles nung decision na yon kaya di ko na babaguhin pa
5972544 sabagay maganda ring principle yon yun lang minsan hindi mo rin kasi ma control yung circumstances like yan si jeff di mo naman ma aanticipate talaga na ayaw niya pala yung song mo
5972545 buti ka pa ganyan ka sana ako rin pwedeng maging ganyan
5972546 wala naman its just that sa family kasi namin ako yung laging kailangan mag adjust i mean ako lagi yung nagi give way dun sa mga gusto nila

5972555 the purpose of the display was substantially thwarted that day
5972556 this particular display is designed to provoke discussion with the students who see it
5972557 ok university of maryland please provide a list of progressive secular events you moved from that spot because it was a fire hazard oh what was that you cant find any
5972558 well what i would do is have a policeman or campus safety director look at the display after it was set up to make any adjustments needed to insure that there was no real danger

5972563 im very committed to making sure my kids have what they need
5972564 i dont care how many trips i have to make to officemax
5972565 the schools probably cannot operate given how deeply we cut them
5972566 there is going to be an impact to the cuts at our school
5972567 but we want to assure parents the needs of their children are being met
5972568 do i really need to do this activity thats going to require 200 sheets of paper or can i teach the same concept in a different way
5972569 demonstrate sensitivity to families when requesting donated items or supplies
5972570 the clark county school district provides students with the essential school supplies however many children enjoy bringing supplies to school you are welcome to purchase any of the items listed below
5972571 we have people losing their homes and their jobs we dont want schools passing on all of these problems to the parents
5972572 you have to satisfy the needs at the level where the children are
5972573 if that means cutting something out of the region office were going to bite the bullet and do it

5972599 did you not tell her you were coming to get me
5972600 watch out for the dogs they are boisterous but friendly enough just make yourself at home
5972601 or your mother perhaps i could make something for all of us
5972602 shes not a bad choice besides there arent that many girls around my age
5972603 yes well im sure she wont not when i know her better
5972604 the fact that her step father beat her has nothing to do with it i suppose
5972605 ive been there remember the smell of fear and her mother was too eager to get her out of the house
5972606 do you think it fair to marry her out of pity
5972607 but love isnt what makes a marriage you taught me that shes strong healthy hardworking she has a kind nature seems to me like she will make a good wife as any
5972608 still do you think you she can give you the life you deserve
5972609 you married helena sable taye into marriages without love they turned out alright
5972610 yes i know love but there are women they need security better to by in a marriage without love than single and starving
5972611 youre a man things are different whether it is fair or not you have a house a business you have your pick of girls you dont need to marry this one if you dont want too girls will be queuing up all im saying is that you have options available to you
5972612 ok love what ever you say i just want you happy
5972613 do not speak about freedom of speech if you are not prepared for the consequences

5972615 were very pleased to bring a newer larger ship to new orleans as well as expand our operations with new seven day western caribbean itineraries
5972616 in addition to serving as an excellent homeport for carnival for nearly 15 years new orleans is a one of a kind vacation destination and were delighted to continue our relationship with this wonderful city
5972617 were very concerned about it mainly because we want the community to know were not here for a handout from the government were a partner with them
5972618 were helping to prevent deaths in the community and were also working with these children to create a prevention effort that could help them stay out of the court system that would cost government more money than the money theyre giving to us now
5972619 it would be very detrimental to our program were providing an essential service to this community and were doing that with lcgs contribution
5972620 when you talk about needs were not talking about tennis courts were not talking about golf carts were talking about people and when government turns its back on people we have no government
5972621 the question as to whether they should receive government support is not so much the issue as it is whats the appropriate mechanism for funding them
5972622 i am so happy that council members are looking at this process and considering that there may be another mechanism for providing governmental support to not for profits whose work is important to our community
5972623 opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5972624 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security
5972625 and will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
5972626 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5972627 the price of expansion and the price of construction is increasing every year
5972628 the sooner we do it the less it will cost
5972629 we never envisioned the level of activity that were seeing out there
5972630 this plan should be called the butchering of students of ward one
5972631 you no longer will have a ville platte high school you gotta send them elsewhere
5972632 the registered voters of ward one can stop this if they accept the tax
5972633 in my opinion the best way to make good coffee is to use a french press
5972634 which correctly measured would be 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of water
5972635 it only heats between 150 and 160 and you need to get it over 190 although the higher end ones get it hotter
5972636 with drip coffee makers the water is dripping straight through the coffee and going into the container not sitting there to extract the full flavor
5972637 another disadvantage with some coffee makers is that most of them have the hot plate under them which keeps cooking the coffee again and again and again and giving it a burnt taste
5972638 in central and south american the coffee has a clean and crisp character to it
5972639 in africa and arabia it has a winey and acidic character not a lot of acid in it but a brightness to the flavor indonisian coffee is earthy and full bodied
5972640 arabica is grown at elevations of over 6 000 feet
5972641 they tend to be more expensive you have to use all hand picked coffee you cant use machines
5972642 im not the only one who knew that but a lot more people are finding out as his story is told
5972643 one of the biggest moments of my life other than when my kids were born was walking into the olympic stadium with daniel
5972644 i know where he came from i know all the things he went through on the way there when you know all those things and you see someone youre so close to reach that moment i cant explain how proud i was of him
5972645 we had a lot of pictures of kaedyn in the house and still do and we had a lot more in disposal cameras that hadnt been developed yet of them together i just thought it would be a good idea because daniel had to be recognized as a father
5972646 i thought that was being lost in the way the whole situation was being handled this was something he could keep for a long long time and always go back to for good memories about kaedyn
5972647 i knew it would be emotional and it was when i first gave it to him he couldnt even get through the whole book he had to go back and look through the whole book later that night he just couldnt do it when i first gave it to him
5972648 i wanted to help daniel so much but what was so frustrating was i couldnt i had no idea of what he was going through because she wasnt my our child
5972649 i just struggled to find my role but in the end my role didnt change because im his wife first i just told daniel id wait for him when he was ready when he was ready to open up and let it all out id be there id always be there for him
5972650 a healthy vigorous debate in the general election between an old style democratic pol and a new generation of political focused leadership is a very healthy thing and everybody wins
5972651 it will enable us to sharpen our discussion and enable the voters to discern which person best represents their issues and their values in olympia
5972652 from my familys perspective they always believe you should be voting for the right person anyway not necessarily a specific party so for my family weve had a lot of discussions leading up to today and its been a good thing
5972653 i think competition is healthy in the political process and if we start having a lot of two democrats on the general election ballot here and two republicans on the general election ballot there then were just picking which flavor of vanilla we like the most french vanilla or vanilla bean and i think that really deprives the voters of a meaningful debate and choice
5972654 voters have always been able to go to the general election and generally be able to choose between a democrat and a republican and some minor parties and that is no longer the case in many cases theyll only have one party to choose from and we think it limits our democracy rather than expanding it
5972655 usually republican and democratic candidates emerge from these primaries and then say mean things about each other and tear each other down often not always but often maybe that will change if you have two candidates emerge from the primary from same party
5972656 when did you know you wanted to be an actor
5972657 maybe it wasnt the way you plan on having a daughter but no one can question how much she means to him its just a shame he had to go through that again
5972658 for him to be able to overcome everything hes been through it just seems obvious that these obstacles placed on his life were put there for this moment
5972659 what really got to me was the promise i made to kaedyn when i lost i felt like i broke that promise and that got to me
5972660 i broke down im a strong guy but that burden that was too much for me to shoulder
5972661 ive changed a lot of things in my life that have improved my wrestling but the biggest thing i had to confront was not carrying that gorilla on my back anymore i wrestle for me now i have to do that to be successful
5972662 i was in the dark on a lot of things
5972663 hes come to grips with that loss and hes in a different place now in a lot of ways now when he does win though the death of his daughter and his love for her still motivate him he does it for daniel that burden being taken off his shoulders has really allowed him to reach a level he wasnt at before
5972664 the bottom line is this theres a price you have to pay and a line that has to be crossed to be the very best in the world
5972665 it wasnt easy for daniel because of all the other things he was dealing with but hes done it daniels commitment to these games is in the bank all thats left is to cash in
5972666 it wasnt something we talked about but it certainly put things in perspective for my life
5972667 daniels an amazing story with an incredible inner strength to overcome what he has but ill tell you what ive checked up on him with olympic team coaches and its obvious hes ready
5972668 i know how great daniel is hes a hammer and i think that hammers going to drop on his opponents in beijing think about it in 2004 he was one win away from a medal with all the turmoil its his time now
5972669 i hate to say someone owes daniel for everything hes been through but someone does
5972670 i dont know if hell win but if he does theyll probably have to arrest me ive watched my son go through too much and if he wins theres just too much locked up inside me im not sure ill be able to control myself
5972671 you learn and grow through all the experiences and ive certainly done that things that have happened and affected my life ive learned to live with both good and bad
5972672 but right now i feel like ive put myself in a position to do something special in beijing
5972673 you know what paul you should probably do this as a miniature
5972674 if i was making the film i made in 1975 now i would have made this film
5972675 i know well have a race across the country where people get run down and score points and televise it
5972676 naw this is just too far out theres no way theyre ever going to make this you cant do this you so cant do that
5972677 should we do another one lets do crank 3 in 3 d
5972678 why make this the last one lets do another one what about crank 3 in 3 d
5972679 theres no way we could replace every basketball game we lost
5972680 in 2009 the arena will be able to actually be returning revenue
5972681 why should someone from annacortes have any say in how king county spend its tax revenue
5972682 fixing this site needs to be the highest immediate priority going forward
5972683 its a cap move joe smith amp mason both have expiring contracts its a cap move for the bucks too getting out from under that insane deal they gave to mo williams last year
5972684 well it seems like being an idiot is in the mayors job description so he just may fit
5972685 additionally mo and michael redd formed the worst defensive backcourt in the nba
5972686 if sc dies so does a lot of hope that community involvement brings the team back
5972687 grrrr if the sonics were still here i could get excited about this
5972688 if sc dies so does a lot of hope that community involvement brings the team back
5972689 schultz taking the team back with mason on it only to trade the entire team to a new owner would really make masons day
5972690 it wouldnt bother me one bit to finish my career in oklahoma city i enjoy being there we all know how negotiations go and how free agency goes but oklahoma city has a special place in my heart for me that would kind of be like a fairytale story to finish where i played college at being around people that i love and being close to home my wife went to college there and our daughter will be able to experience what we experienced there growing as young adults
5972691 we werent making the playoffs but they were pumped up and screaming loud
5972692 in the nba you go to a city and you have a couple of bad possessions and you will get booed out of the gym in a lot of arenas
5972693 and to me it felt like a college atmosphere where if youre kind of messing up a little bit maybe youre dropping the ball on defense or you turn it over a couple of times the fans started cheering trying to get you going again and thats something that i havent seen in my career as an nba player so that was refreshing to see that fan support
5972694 give us what we want or well take your team away
5972695 we are disgusted with the nba and we do not want you back in washington we have no desire to do business with organizations that operate as you do
5972696 ill bet theyre sign and trading delonte to make it happen
5972697 honestly had we not worked with him i think it likely the first offer of 26m with no involvement of ballmer and no plan however flimsy to get us a future team
5972698 i can tell you that the ballmer stanton group is with the mayor you dont get to choose one or the other
5972699 the schultz case relies on the funding of a venue sometime before its completion they want the team sold to a willing and honest buyer but readily acknowledge that without the building there is no buyer so what gives us the best odds at a building the mayor right now
5972700 i dont think had sos been enemies with the mayor anything would be different
5972701 dick tate says august 12th 2008 at 12 10 pm less focus on government and more on private interests then now and forever the only way to keep the sonics in seattle was to build a new arena for bennett abandoning that effort and focusing on lease enforcement was the end of the battle
5972702 the big mistake was to indicate that an expansion team would be acceptable you should have known you were getting hosed as soon as that came up why expand in seattle
5972703 you get an arena amp well get you a team
5972704 the big mistake was to indicate that an expansion team would be acceptable
5972705 we did all we could do with the rally and the attention the phone calls etc
5972706 further mucking up the situation is schultz quixotic quest to get back at clay bennett through a long shot lawsuit
5972707 at least some esssential part of me will continue after death
5972708 why should i fear what else can befall a man except he should go to meet his destiny
5972709 in the past 15 years nothing has given entertainment publishers quite as many sleepless nights as internet piracy starting with the rise of napster the music sharing service in the 1990s the rapidly increasing speed of broadband connections has allowed consumers to share and copy media files in vast quantities
5972710 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5972711 france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom this is a just cause it is an honor for france and for its army to defend it
5972712 if i just take something it will make me fall asleep and i wont wake up not die just sleep sleep sleep until its better and i can come back to this reality
5972713 hm i wonder how many of these i could take and still be alive
5972714 could i take 30 of these and not die i dont want to die i just want these feelings to be suppressed long enough for me to figure it all out
5972715 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic

5972718 primary advisor to the secretary and the department on energy and technology policy development
5972719 has played a prominent behind the scenes role in shaping the administrations environmental policies for several years the officials said helping to rewrite rules affecting the air that americans breathe and the waters that oil tankers traverse in every instance according to both his allies and opponents he has challenged proposals that would place additional regulations on industry
5972720 helped scale back a rule proposed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to protect north atlantic right whales one of the most endangered animals on the planet from lethal ship strikes the rule noaa submitted 1 1 2 years ago originally would have required ships within 30 nautical miles of several east coast ports to slow to 10 knots or less during parts of the year when the whales are migrating
5972721 just this year hutto opposed tightening federal rules for smog forming ozone which is linked to thousands of premature deaths each year and in 2005 he questioned why the epa needed to limit mercury emissions from power plants because the agency had just issued a rule that would have the incidental effect of somewhat reducing the toxic pollutant in both instances the epa strengthened the protections over these objections
5972722 its not surprising that the bush administration is considering a candidate who has a track record of putting politics ahead of science over and over again appointments like this one have damaged the governments ability to protect the environment and public health

5972730 se ha ido en andaluc a en esa direcci n de convertir el sentimiento en conciencia creo que no
5972731 ha quedado un terreno libre una vez que pr cticamente han desaparecido las siglas andalucistas y por eso se producen situaciones como sta en la que el psoe lleg a plantear que blas infante era su principal referencia algo que es descabellado
5972732 el intento de entonces del psoe de capitalizar el andalucismo ten a cierta autenticidad y el de ahora cierta impostura

5972814 we know that redistribution alone as the sole policy tool to tackle poverty has failed
5972815 there are 900 000 more people in severe poverty than in 1997 and child poverty has been rising for two years in succession
5972816 that approach is failing because it relies on a flawed assumption that only the state can guarantee fairness

5972827 weve been on this path for the last few years
5972828 theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
5972829 i dont think anything can surpass ebay in terms of choice but e commerce is now mainstream we see our competitive set as a broad one anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online that might be amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks but the big advantage we have is choice mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs sitting alongside big retailers
5972830 i think theres room for everybody at the end of the day having big brands on there helps legitimise ebay as a marketplace having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience
5972831 we hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers
5972832 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
5972833 any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others the sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest
5972834 ebay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers
5972835 they are realising that sellers are ebay customers too and listening to their customers
5972836 people forget the internet has changed when ebay started out a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the atlantic now with instant payments buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery
5972837 if ebay doesnt take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction it will fail buyers will go to amazon or argos instead amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to amazon you can buy almost anything on ebay the challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service its a hard tightrope to walk

5972847 we did try to make some added modifications to our directory and offered a platform to these smb who are our target customers
5972848 we have found a great need for such portals forums as in their pursuit to grow the smbs have no place to seek information and opinions from masters and experienced people

5972854 homeowners facing rising mortgage payments are selling properties at deep discounts and banks are clearing out foreclosed homes
5972855 every week lenders seize almost 80 homes from borrowers who have stopped paying their mortgages those homes go back on the market sometimes within weeks other times within months almost always at a sharp discount
5972856 sonoma county housing prices wont stabilize until sales cut into the glut of distressed properties hitting the market bringing the overall supply of homes for sale into better balance with buyer demand appleton young said
5972857 lower priced homes will likely drive the countys housing market into next year because of the continuing wave of foreclosures appleton young said
5972858 any recovery also could be slowed by tightened lending requirements as well as the economys downturn

5972867 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5972868 we have also provisionally found that there are competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5972869 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5972870 ryanair welcomes the competition commissions comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorses its findings

5972956 we have two other projects that we are working on for christmas so we are pretty busy
5972957 the important thing is that were targeting mobile gamers so we are adapting the gameplay for mobile
5972958 we want kroll to be accessible to everybody the theme may be fantasy but we need to combine that with gameplay that is quite simple and works with the interface we have learned that you cant just throw a pc game onto mobile and expect it to work well
5972959 n gage wasnt a console it had a wider audience so for the sequel we decided to change it you cant play this kind of game with one thumb so we went with two thumb controls its working pretty well the inspiration was the nintendo game boy with the cross pad and two buttons
5972960 weve made the combos much more simple and worked a lot on the story mode
5972961 but we have other innovative features in there too like bluetooth which is working really well
5972962 this is a book about a spirituality that leads us all to life about how the poor need the rich and the rich need the poor and how all of us are in need of god
5972963 as we look upon the faces of our friends who are poor as we see the children friends begging on the streets and those in need we are being confronted by christ he is placing before us an opportunity to love and serve him through the needs of the impoverished he is offering an invitation to his community
5972964 we want to let god in but usually on our terms we want to make room for christ to reign on the thrones of our hearts but only a clean christ who doesnt make a mess of our lives

5972973 the military doesnt want you to see that all the georgian homes have been burned down its as simple as that
5972974 caused all of our problems they turned off our water and gas in the past
5972975 russia should prevent any further militia attacks and allow humanitarian aid to reach the hundreds of vulnerable civilians still in the area including many elderly
5972976 this area now occupied by russian troops is effectively under russian control the georgian military is not there so russia has a responsibility to protect civilians there

5973005 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
5973006 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
5973007 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
5973008 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilize both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data
5973009 its been a pretty exciting morning i couldnt sleep very well but these next few days are really important
5973010 theyve been instrumental in helping develop our sound we had a lot of unfinished business with them as well its the final record of our record deal
5973011 thats something i was concerned about when recording we didnt want a record that sounded like two halves sandwiched together we wanted something dark and kind of frightening incorporating lots of inorganic sounds played in a very organic way if that makes any sense although the recording processes were different with each producer i think weve maintain ed that ill be interested to see if you can work out which producer did what until something physical comes out no ones gonna know that wasnt the game plan but thats going to be an interesting by product of the way weve chosen to release it
5973012 yeah i think thats one thing weve learnt the industrys changed so much in the last year
5973013 you can do whatever you want why not drop an album when its finished instead of sitting on it for six months
5973014 were really proud of it it was one of the first ones we finished
5973015 can you call your guy cause im on the phone

5973018 hes coming as a kid i was a big fan of greek mythology those stories and characters have stayed with me but thats it the working titles have stuck you realise six months down the line you cant name it anything else because youre so attached trojan horse was lyrically a very different song at the end of recording but the title was still there to me the song rises and attacks like a trojan horse
5973019 its like a term of yeah an affectionate term nothing to do with stephen biko or the peter gabriel song
5973020 without giving too much away theres a recurrent sound through the song kinda like the wind whistling to me the lyrics are a whole other issue i wouldnt get too mythical until you hear the music itll make sense then

5973025 operators have started bundling hotspot access with other services such as fixed and mobile broadband
5973026 this way consumers can access hotspots without paying a separate fee and operators can generate some access revenue by bundling the cost of the service into a bigger service package that consumers are willing to purchase
5973027 hotspot owners are still charging if they control a prime location like airports where there is no alternative
5973028 it is hard for them to just walk away from that revenue stream even if it will decline

5973045 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5973046 the world is asking russia to live up to its commitments
5973047 with every commitment and with every failure to live up to that commitment the international pressure will grow
5973048 a country relies on the word of its president being its bond
5973049 is becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5973050 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5973051 i am not one that believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanour i think the right answer is hard headed dialogue
5973052 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russian relationship
5973053 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5973054 all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words
5973055 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional

5973058 china moves past the americans with 39 olympic gold medals
5973059 china has been trying to host the olympics for years
5973060 youd be surprised how many tourists come in here and still think chinese wear long dresses and pull their cows down the sides of the road
5973061 this is giving china a chance to show everybody how advanced it is
5973062 people are chuckling at the medal count that although the chinese have the most gold medals of any country nbc always puts the americans on top because they add the total medals
5973063 maybe when track and field is over the americans will edge back on top
5973064 everyone is learning a little more about china by watching these games
5973065 maybe thats helping them win hopefully they will have more respect for the environment when this is all over
5973066 the seven fatal mistakes that almost every business owner makes on their web site
5973067 unlike a movie when youre shooting something like this youre definitely taking a piece in a world and youre integrating it into another world so because i didnt design the game i dont know this world and thats not my thing when you have a movie script you know from a to z where its going
5973068 with this we kind of had to really sit down and be very specific about where we are in the game and what our motivation is and what were trying to say and where were trying to bring the player its very very technical so in that sense it is very difficult
5973069 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
5973070 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
5973071 we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly longer than in a better functioning market
5973072 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time

5973077 he was the only one who was there for me
5973078 the premier now knows everything he needs to know to try to enact some fairness on this issue
5973079 i think its safe to say from the look on his face that he was rather taken aback
5973080 we dont feel given the facts that this railway has any right to charge anyone for accessing their property
5973081 weve asked the premier to find an existing law or to institute a new law that gives nova scotians the right to access their land
5973082 although we can regulate issues like safety when you get into other areas well well have to see whether were able to even do so or whether we should do so
5973083 theres been no findings of any evidence to indicate mr sperry has been in the area recently
5973084 we know mr sperry had health conditions that could impact on his abilities and those factors continue to be relative to our search
5973085 the search continues to be assessed as it progresses and we will assess at some point its viability

5973094 one of them hit me in the back of the head
5973095 i went down to the ground and one of them sprinted up beside me and kicked me in the face
5973096 they kicked me in the face and basically drove my teeth almost all the way through my lip and they kicked me in the eye and i have some serious swelling there
5973097 they called me a squealer while i was screaming for help
5973098 i think we have a group of young people that are a little bit out of control right now
5973099 what were going to have to do obviously is identify them start working with their families and those old enough will be prosecuted in court

5973102 we are concentrating on the second world war or korean veterans because of the time factor
5973103 ive also got a vested interest in honouring our veterans
5973104 on our radar we had two vessels that we knew had been taken by pirates
5973105 so the threat is real its almost eerie coming down that coast and seeing a radar contact with a name on it and knowing that those vessels are held by pirates
5973106 the crews lives are in danger and ransoms of millions of dollars are being demanded from the companies who own them
5973107 the danger with getting too close or attempting to contact the seized ships is if we threaten them they may think that were the navy special forces coming in to try to do a rescue and the next thing weve got is dead hostages
5973108 they clearly know the ocean a little bit and they go out in some pretty bad weather and manage to get on board these big ships
5973109 they typically will threaten the ships by firing rocket propelled grenades small arms or mortars at them so they show that force get them to slow down and they have built ladders that they hook onto the sides of vessels to get on board
5973110 were going to take this first one up the coast today
5973111 were going to then pick up a large ship coming from south africa off the kenyan coast and take him into mogadishu and come back here for the third one so weve got a busy few days ahead of us here
5973112 there is no pirate that has systems on board that can take on a 1 billion warship
5973113 it simply is a no go for them to try to do that
5973114 none of the other countries ships that have been doing this have ever even seen pirates
5973115 for small boats a warship of this size this well armed its extraordinarily unlikely pirates would approach it and if they do i dont believe theyll even get anywhere close to the world food program ships the visual presence will probably scare them off before anyone has to actually do anything
5973116 were right on the equator so the heat is pretty extreme during the day
5973117 youve really got to make sure you drink a lot of water
5973118 the ship is the main weapon were going to be standing by to protect the food and the crew
5973119 we think were ready for pretty much any scenario but were still hoping for the best
5973120 we dont know but the question came up and its something were looking into
5973121 those of us who have witnessed arrests have filled out formal complaints and were going to all go into the police station as a collective group and hand in those complaints at once
5973122 he was thrown to the ground and seven officers tackled him it was actually pretty scary
5973123 of course i was a little worried at first that he might rock the boat when he touched it or something but he never did anything like that
5973124 theres nobody there of his own species to socialize with or to talk to or will talk back to him
5973125 it goes beyond curiosity hes trying to fill a void

5973127 for the most part your physical presence on the princeton campus is not required
5973128 youre required to have a certain residency so youd have to go for a year but then the rest of your degree you can finish from here
5973129 there are an increasing number of people who are taking for example phds remotely from the u k because theyve gotten very good at this model of delivery
5973130 im not sure i see the case for a radical redesign of institutions
5973131 i do see the argument that yes bachelor degrees are stuffy and yes for some young people the pull of a tight labour market is going to make it tougher to lure them into post secondary that youre going to have to find ways to let them earn and learn at the same time i get that
5973132 they are the basic social network for people in professional positions and i just dont see changing that

5973151 its a terrible example to set for a young child promoting an industry that electrocutes animals snaps their necks and skins them alive
5973152 there is nothing feminine about inserting an electrode into the anus of a terrified and struggling fox and then electrocuting it
5973153 ms paltrow is an actress and seemingly a particularly stupid one at that
5973154 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5973155 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5973156 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
5973157 you never really want to leave your team and your teammates and all that but its nice to be back in a pennant race
5973158 it was fun playing in san diego and i loved it there but im looking forward to the last month and a half here it was great last time i was here it was fun and it was exciting i had a lot of good memories then and i look forward to making some new ones
5973159 for me its kind of like the first day of spring training all over again i just want to learn my teammates and do what i can to be accepted get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them hopefully well get to the postseason and find out if its a better team than 2 years ago its how you do in october that determines how good the team is
5973160 he does a good job on defense and calling the game and handling the pitchers
5973161 but at the same time hes got to be better than a 220 hitter
5973162 weve had a lot of things said about fans here
5973163 a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
5973164 it gives us a little more balance in the lineup
5973165 gets a big hit now and then i think what hes hitting he can hit more hes got a good swing but at times hes not very aggressive he needs to be more aggressive
5973166 mondays are different in the delaware valley after an eagles loss
5973167 you can see it in peoples faces and after an eagles win you can see people almost walking on air theyre so happy it could be pouring on the monday after an eagles win but the sun is always shining the fans here are so tied emotionally to these teams
5973168 they come from the same psychological mechanism its why its possible to switch so quickly from cheering to booing we have high expectations we feel huge highs and suffer terrible lows
5973169 if we were kicking butt and winning championships people would be a little more relaxed
5973170 but theres no doubt that people have a chip on their shoulders because they have to hear new york and their mess about were new york and whatever
5973171 i think some worry that if the game is on tv and they dont boo people watching will be disappointed
5973172 its almost expected so we have to deliver and if they boo and it isnt loud enough people are disappointed but so long as it isnt disruptive its also plain old fun its tradition
5973173 theyre in there playing the game in their heads theyre on the field its a love hate relationship think about your own life there are people who you adore and theyre the same people you fight the most with they dont feel like theyre a spectator watching a sport they feel like theyre your friend youre the hardest on the people you love the most
5973174 that suggests to me that were a much healthier city than some people think we dont bottle our emotions were not aloof some other cities its not that they bottle their emotions its that the emotions arent even there

5973180 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse

5973186 it took a while for them to admit they did not have a replacement bin and then they suggested we share
5973187 but our bin is usually kept in the back garden so what is the neighbour going to do lob it over the fence
5973188 and i hear there are fines for leaving bins on the street and for putting the wrong items in the bins so i wouldnt want to leave it out on the street
5973189 try and manage as much as you can if you have a really serious problem come back to us and we shall see what we can do
5973190 but in the meantime can you try and co operate with your neighbour and use their bin

5973198 the pacific islands forum also has expectations about good governance
5973199 it has expectations that fiji will keep its word and what weve heard rippling out of fiji over the last day or two is that fiji not only doesnt intend coming to this meeting but it is starting to float the possibility that they might leave the forum altogether
5973200 its refused to do that and instead has started floating that it could leave altogether
5973201 the relationship between the forum and fiji is very frosty because people feel let down

5973213 hes got some power he can catch and throw and calls a good game
5973214 hes been trying to hit the ball the other way and stay through the ball and hes getting better at that hes cut down on his strikeouts hes a veteran guy
5973215 he does a good job on defense calling the game and handling the pitchers
5973216 at the same time were not hitting hes got to be better than a 220 hitter but if everyone was hitting i think ruiz would be hitting more if everyone else was hitting we wouldnt even be talking about ruiz
5973217 i think it would be asking a lot of a young catcher and it might be a lot to ask of a veteran catcher
5973218 some guys have that knack but those guys might be hard to find
5973219 typically with veteran guys it would be much easier to do if you can catch you can catch its just a matter of how much information you can retain from the pitching coach and other sources besides if we bring a catcher in it doesnt mean hes going to play every day
5973220 it will give us another guy on the bench greg dobbs or eric bruntlett and feliz defense
5973221 this guy can get some big hits for you i think he can hit more if we work with him a little bit more and the more confidence he gets i think hell hit more id like to see him get more aggressive and be more consistent with his swing
5973222 all the information that we get those scouts sit up there for a reason
5973223 the biggest difference i see you see guys chasing balls in the dirt chasing balls out of the strike zone things like that to me thats the difference
5973224 thats how you go to school on the hitter until you make adjustments more than likely theyre going to stay there some teams pitch us different but the majority of them throw us slow stuff before when they came at us with hard stuff wed light them up
5973225 it seems to me i hear were out of it right now like were not even close
5973226 but the reality is were a game and a half back with six weeks to play
5973227 i feel were the best team in this division we just need to go out there and play like it
5973228 i know the players in the clubhouse ive been with these guys for two years now weve got good players in here weve got guys that can play
5973229 i think somewhere along the line jenkins is going to get hot
5973230 but i like werths talent and the fact that he can hit in the two hole because he hits balls to the right side of the diamond and he can steal bags
5973231 before i got injured i hit second in l a
5973232 i like it if thats where charlie wants to put me in the lineup thats where ill hit
5973233 if he wants to hit me sixth or seventh but how can you not like hitting second in this lineup youve got chase howie ryan howard and pat hitting behind you thats not a bad place to hit really
5973234 if they want to boo me thats fine boo me
5973235 just keep it off everyone else you had some cheers you had some boos like i said when you get the win theyll cheer you

5973278 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan for the champions trophy obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the taskforce which we did we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it our position hasnt changed
5973279 i have won but i still dont feel like im playing as good as i would like to play
5973280 sometimes ive been a little sloppy in not getting my bowls close theres always room for improvement but the first goal is to get into the gold medal round and i have a lot of strong teams i have yet to play so im not getting ahead of myself but im pleased so far
5973281 the speed is really good i prefer a faster green because i get a better feel and im able to make the adjustments better than on a sluggish one im impressed
5973282 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
5973283 you never really want to leave your team and your teammates and all that but its nice to be back in a pennant race
5973284 it was fun playing in san diego and i loved it there but im looking forward to the last month and a half here it was great last time i was here it was fun and it was exciting i had a lot of good memories then and i look forward to making some new ones
5973285 for me its kind of like the first day of spring training all over again i just want to learn my teammates and do what i can to be accepted get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them hopefully well get to the post season and find out if its a better team than two years ago its how you do in october that determines how good the team is
5973286 i mean the last thing you want to do is accommodate one guy and screw up four i dont know what their reasons are i didnt ask and i didnt care im just glad to be here and im glad they gave me a day to pitch which is friday
5973287 well put him in friday hell be pitching every five days from there
5973288 his experience is his hole card youre going to have to find a way to beat him because he wont beat himself he has the ability to keep you in a game he knows what hes doing to me he adds more than just taking the ball every five or six days
5973289 fatal crush or hunger pangs take our true love challenge
5973290 a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5973291 and now were talking about a chance to win the fedex cup
5973292 the tour said they wanted more volatility but are they setting themselves up for a guy like me
5973293 have i had a better year than kenny perry or padraig harrington no but the playoffs arent all about who had the best year its who is playing well in the playoffs the new york giants certainly were not the best team in the league but they won the super bowl
5973294 i seem to be the biggest procrastinator in the world when it means something
5973295 its a wonder i ever got married and had kids but you know they give you 42 weeks just because i waited until the last week doesnt bother me im elated to be where im at
5973296 i think that was the biggest thing coming in and getting used to what goes on in the clubhouse
5973297 thats made all the difference helping me relax and be out there and pitch
5973298 he hasnt felt the pressure to win every start hes just done it
5973299 it feels like hes been with us for six years
5973300 im just trying to go out and keep us in games and help the team win
5973301 we score a lot of runs and i know if i can keep it close at some point in the game were going to score runs
5973302 when you go out and make a move like that for a guy like sabathia who is last years cy young ward winner and a guy who is a proven big time winner if thats not an impact on your team and the town youre playing in nothing is
5973303 hes not a vocal leader but watching him pitch the guys the players his teammates enjoy watching him pitch as much as i do as much as the fans do
5973304 the one thing were learning is that it does take a no 1 starter pitcher like him and a no 1 or 2 type like ben sheets
5973305 not many of those guys sign though not many guys sign
5973306 theyve got to play the market game and we understand that
5973307 he could just sit there and go well im going to be here for three months im here to pitch im here to win games and thats it
5973308 but hes a great teammate and i think a lot of people enjoy having him around
5973309 he told me keeping doing what youre doing youre going to be fine thats always good to hear
5973310 i asked ned if i could go back out and he let me
5973311 my silver medal is gold to me because of all the bad things that happened to me this year
5973312 i tried to stay calm but i was pissed because from the beginning i wanted to come here and right away show that foot injury was way behind me and i can dive
5973313 i didnt do as good as i wanted to that was a turning point
5973314 the hardest part of coming back from that injury was mentally
5973315 physically we always do the training mentally it was very hard for me to stay positive and believe i was going to pull this off believe that i was going to be able to come in put six dives together and perform
5973316 there were days at the beginning where all my reflexes were gone everything was gone
5973317 i remember the first day i started diving after that practice i told arturo were very far from the promised land my friend i had to stay calm and stay positive and believe in myself and believe i was going to be able to perform today and i did
5973318 it got him to really look inside himself and understand what he really wants to do
5973319 we wouldnt have had the guts to pull him off diving for the period of time he was off
5973320 the broken foot forced him into a whole other mindset in some ways it was a bit of a blessing in disguise he was getting stale he was struggling for motivation in practices he was getting distracted by all the demands on his time this sort of woke him up
5973321 i never look at the score so i didnt know how far or how close everything was
5973322 when i stepped on that board my main focus was to stay focused on that dive and keep repeating to myself what i had to do to nail that dive
5973323 it is extremely hard to come into china and compete against them
5973324 they are so strong already being home just makes them that much stronger
5973325 i was in a hole and had to dig myself back
5973326 heading into this games i was way deeper in the hole this year than i was in athens and i dug myself back
5973327 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
5973328 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
5973329 this week can make or break you and if it makes you youve still got another week of make or break you
5973330 it doesnt get any easier youve got to play well you cant afford to get swept youve got to win some series here otherwise you can start thinking about next year
5973331 theres a certain amount of preparation you need when you enter a competition and the more that you take away from that preparation the less of a competition it becomes in our opinion
5973332 when you look at technology and whats allowed and whats not allowed you have to draw the line somewhere
5973333 players need to prepare they need to be out there they need to pace they need to figure out their yardage understand their yardage and theres room for error
5973334 these things arent bad theyre just not right for our national championships
5973335 players shoot pace then shoot again its not a pace of play cure all
5973336 i just told her youre on the back burner you are the dark horse step out into the light change it all
5973337 we were the underdogs nobody expected anything out of all three of us
5973338 and for us to go out there and place 1 2 3 and prove to the world that we are here and we are competitors its such an exciting feeling
5973339 i feel like ive jumped out of my body and gone to heaven and back this is a dream thats become a reality of mine
5973340 it was so close from my angle i couldnt really tell
5973341 it just started flashing photo finish photo finish photo finish for what seemed like about 10 days
5973342 this is the pinnacle of sports to be an olympic medallist thats more impressive than a super bowl ring
5973343 there were no words just screams but we knew what we were saying to each other in those screams
5973344 i knew they were on the sixth hurdle so when i ran around the track and got to that sixth hurdle mark i was looking around for them and they were just swinging the canadian flag back and forth
5973345 a lot of people didnt think she could do it a lot of people didnt think she should have been here in the first place but she actually went out there and proved the whole world wrong
5973346 my thing to her when we got here was theres three cookies in the jar just get one
5973347 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5973348 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5973349 in eight years weve become this dominant force in track racing its really great
5973350 i just remember i am here and i have won a gold medal
5973351 im just trying to get through to the next round
5973352 i could hear the other guys breathing and i sprinted and now im the olympic winner
5973353 i think we are playing good technically physically and mentally
5973354 the 20 yuan per megawatt hour tariff hike announced is not sufficient to offset the increase in coal cost in june and august
5973355 he is in the top tier of athletics and now hes going to get his tryout as a personality
5973356 and tiger woods sure passed but mark spitz didnt and there are plenty of people who they try to develop the whole persona around and two years later its gone
5973357 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5973358 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5973359 one gold medal is amazing two is well incredible three practically unbelievable but eight eight gold medals thats thats well well were going to need some new adjectives for whatever that is congratulations michael
5973360 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5973361 its huge its the opportunity that no startup generally gets
5973362 with opportunity obviously theres a lot of responsibility for us to take advantage of it properly and do it in a way that not only benefits the company but also benefits michael
5973363 we are currently evaluating opportunities to build upon this excitement however a final determination about our future plans has not yet been made
5973364 is he funny is he warm is he interesting does he say things that make you want to listen more or is he the great athlete who is pleased to be here and hes done its going to be interesting
5973365 we all did a double take because she was dating pro skater terry kennedy
5973366 that kid is a really good looking hitter with power

5973377 the illuminati knows the people are going to find out about them the best thing they can do is call your attention towards something else and say thats that so they have reflected the attention on zionism the only problem is that most of the people in the illuminati arent jews their founders were jews by birth but not by religion but most of its leaders except for the rothschilds are gaelic scotch or french gaelic its got nothing to do with jews my family amp most of the people serving on the grand druid their family trees go back to the pagan temples in rome amp greece amp england to the original priesthood some go back as far as egypt amp babylon its got nothing to do with the jews
5973378 the rothschilds lead the illuminati and in every country they have a family being the head of the illuminati in the united states we have the rockefellers david rockefeller is both the head of the council of foreign relations and the trilateral commission which is the name of the illuminati within the united states
5973379 on the top of each pyramid you will see a capstone with an eye in it
5973380 the golden dawn is the organization of witchcraft the 4th block up there and its the rothschilds private coven they choose every member personally
5973381 we have received no offers for albert riera not from liverpool or any other club herrera told sky sports
5973382 we know what has been written in the newspapers but this is the truth
5973383 liverpool want riera but liverpool are reluctant to meet espanyols demands
5973384 ive just found this picture on the net and i need to make up lies in order to display it
5973385 im sorry to disappoint them but that is not possible
5973386 cuando uno escuche m sica en la radio sonar como si estuviese en el concierto y no en tu mesa desayunando
5973387 you should write an editorial telling the provincial government that our budget has been frozen for more than eight years
5973388 we have a website but i have only one part time technician to update it
5973389 we dont have a communications officer we need one but we dont have the budget to have one
5973390 a judge is now required to have a very active life in the community
5973391 we also go out of our way to make our judgments and court hearings very accessible
5973392 its a good project that will allow us to continue to operate for many more years a plant that is safe a plant that will produce electricity at a competitive price
5973393 its a good business decision for the regional economy as well as for the rest of quebec
5973394 our estimate derives from eight years of feasibility studies evaluation preparatory work and inspections
5973395 generally in the nuclear world a lot of it doesnt have to do with economics and more to with the prestige of having a nuclear facility
5973396 frankly 2 billion for 600 megawatts is quite a lot
5973397 the government has had a policy that wont accept a used fuel waste site in quebec
5973398 today however they have given the okay to producing more radioactive waste thats hypocritical
5973399 it usually takes 40 years for the radiation to subside enough to get near it
5973400 theyre going to stop the reactor and send the workers in right after they say there is no danger but thats completely false
5973401 the democratic vote by however strong a majority would have no legal effect on its own and could not push aside the principles of federalism and the rule of law the rights of individuals and minorities or the operation of democracy in the other provinces or in canada as a whole democratic rights under the constitution cannot be divorced from constitutional obligations
5973402 our message has to indicate that if a clear majority of quebeckers vote on a clear question to leave canada the country will not be held together by force
5973403 should they ever win a clear majority on a clear question
5973404 if the qu b cois very clearly in accordance with a procedure that is very clear decide to leave canada we cannot retain them against their will
5973405 no one challenges the right of the qu b cois to stay in canada or to leave it a canada wide referendum cannot block the clearly expressed will of the qu b cois
5973406 if some day we quebeckers no longer want to be canadians and it is clear that we no longer want to be canadians well then we will be able to commit the future generations to this fundamental choice and it will happen there is no one who will hold us in canada against our will
5973407 if the qu b cois should some day vote for sovereignty how will you react
5973408 if it is a decision freely consented being a democrat profoundly a democrat i accept it

5973411 and with value for money as the main purchase criteria buyers are all the more keen in purchasing vehicles that fit specific needs
5973412 at the same time first time car buyers whose needs are for personal use bought passenger cars with preference for smaller engines buyers are also keen on the ownership cost when buying vehicles fuel efficiency is top of mind for buyers these days
5973413 the strong growth can be attributed to the robust sales in vans and pickups purchased by buyers who seek value for money and multi purpose vehicles to serve their needs

5973431 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
5973432 this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
5973433 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
5973434 new technology and systems designed to enhance border security or identify other violations of law
5973435 there was absolutely no way they should have the entire database
5973436 once you have data in a database you dont need it lends itself to unauthorized use

5973461 the question in this case is whether permitting authorities may supplement inadequate monitoring requirements when epa has taken no action
5973462 if the monitoring isnt good enough the whole system falls apart
5973463 affects every major stationary air pollution source in the country this is a very important case just in terms of the publics right to know and guarding the publics opportunity to keep tabs
5973464 determine the appropriate course of action once the review is complete we are still assessing the implications of the decision
5973465 is a complex statute with a clear objective it enlists epa and state and local environmental authorities in a common effort to create a permit program for most stationary sources of air pollution
5973466 by its terms this mandate means that a monitoring requirement insufficient to assure compliance with emission limits has no place in the permit unless and until it is supplemented by more rigorous standards
5973467 to determine whether state and local permitting authorities can impose additional monitoring requirements

5973473 there is virtually nothing that we have touched in the last six months that hasnt increased
5973474 the prices have increased so rapidly and so high compared to historically where theyve been its just been uncharted territory
5973475 the cure for the inflation problem is a recession in the united states and europe
5973476 we have a recession and while thats lamentable it makes the inflation numbers old news
5973477 the consumer is either going to get smacked around by inflation or a sagging economy if youre someone who depends on a paycheck neither one helps you very much
5973478 theres some reason to think this could have been inflations last hurrah
5973479 wages are still well behaved which is good from an inflation point of view
5973480 were now down to buying generic brands of food and even that has risen in price
5973481 its come on in a rush just in the last three months or so
5973482 its frightening i have been in this business 37 years generally when there was a downturn prices have stabilized or dropped this is the antithesis of that
5973483 many people who came to the restaurant would be like oh isnt salad included
5973484 in the 36 years ive been in this business this is the most unusual steel market ive ever been in
5973485 youve got to have the steel and thats the price
5973486 people on the east coast and west coast are seeing their food bill rise well a lot of that increase is ending up here
5973487 ive been farming for 39 years and i havent seen a better year than this one
5973488 it will get my tax bill down a lot in whats looking to be a real good year for income i just wanted to take advantage of that
5973489 ive been through two or three of these things in my lifetime
5973490 the biggest risk is the interest rates if they swing up higher it makes it much harder for a farmer to keep paying the debt
5973491 but at the end of the day you cant throw a bunch of equipment in the back of a ford fusion
5973492 we lost a lot of the people who were coming into blair to buy things we used to have a penneys you know
5973493 things just dont go up forever i dont know when this will end or whether it will be bad when it does but this will go the other way
5973494 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5973495 we are in the midst of a fierce correction from a period of indiscriminate behavior in the credit markets a surfeit of homebuilding a global avalanche of cheap labor and correspondingly cheap imports and other unsustainable financial and economic activity
5973496 unless the python that is the u s economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost push pressures we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations
5973497 should this happen and the fed were to fail to address it we would run the risk of losing the publics confidence in our ability to constrain inflation
5973498 the demand for loans is not there nor are banks willing to extend credit even if it were if this weakness becomes entrenched over the autumn it is a clear sign of very weak american output growth in 2009

5973592 its a relatively new field but it has been taking off and a lot of local companies are paying attention to it for the first time companies want the best and the brightest and as a result people are being poached there is a talent shortage and it is the case that companies have not found enough time to build up their own resources

5973671 na ja das gro e zittern wird die gestrige nato sitzung zur georgien krise in moskau nicht gerade ausgel st haben
5973672 das m chtigste milit rb ndnis der welt will nicht mit handfesten massnahmen auf die russische machtdemonstration in georgien reagieren das ist kein spektakul rer aber ein kluger entscheid noch ist nicht wirklich klar was russland mit dem einmarsch in georgien erreichen wollte russland hat sich bei aller brutaler machtanwendung letztlich im zaum gehalten tiflis wurde nicht besetzt die strategisch wichtigen lpipelines nicht angefasst moskau weiss dass es seine eigenen grossen wirtschaftlichen interessen im westen aufs spiel setzt wenn es diese selbst provozierte krise eskalieren l sst auch aus diesem grund w re es falsch gewesen jetzt mit harten massnahmen russland in die isolation zu dr ngen
5973673 die zeit ist vorbei in der russland in einer mischung aus versch chterung und bewunderung auf das europ ische modell geblickt hat
5973674 was die europ er am meisten verwirren m sste das ist die tatsache dass all dies jetzt in einer phase geschieht in der russland und die europ ische union doch ausgezeichnete gr nde f r eine verst ndigung h tten die russen haben l und gas und wir haben das kapital die technologie und die wirtschaftskultur die russland braucht um die verlorene zeit wieder aufzuholen der hintergrund ist vergleichbar der lage nach dem zweiten weltkrieg als frankreich deutschland und anderen europ ischen l ndern eine hnliche zusammenarbeit vorgeschlagen hatte damals ging es um den wiederaufbau eines zerst rten kontinents nach dem ende des kalten krieges brauchen wir heute ein europ isch russisches zusammengehen auf den feldern energie und entwicklung wenn wir den weg gehen werden auch die usa entdecken dass es andere formen des zusammenlebens mit russland gibt und sie werden dankbar daf r sein
5973675 im westen georgiens gab es kein zeichen eines r ckzugs russischer truppen die realit t im land macht das waffenstillstandsabkommen l cherlich allerdings k nnen weitere ultimaten gegen ber russland mehr schaden als n tzen doch die nato kriegsschiffe sollten so lange im schwarzen meer bleiben bis der r ckzug abgeschlossen ist und die organisation f r sicherheit und zusammenarbeit in europa osze sollte darauf bestehen russische friedenstruppen in der region durch eigene zu ersetzen eu und nato sollten zudem klare mechanismen vereinbaren um russland zu isolieren falls es den r ckzug noch weiter hinausz gert
5973676 die nato brauchte zehn tage bis es ein treffen zu georgien gab
5973677 jeder mensch hat ein ohrger usch aber die meisten h ren es nur in absoluter stille
5973678 wenn ohrger usche zum ersten mal auftreten sollte man zun chst einmal ruhe bewahren
5973679 es handelt sich dabei nicht um einen notfall allenfalls um einen eilfall die meisten ger usche gehen innerhalb von zwei tagen von selber wieder weg
5973680 es handelt sich dabei um eine akustische wahrnehmung die auf eine erkrankung meistens des innenohrs hinweist

5973684 wir gehen heute von einer stabilisierung aus die volatilit t bleibt aber hoch
5973685 it gave me chills to think that we really contributed to their success
5973686 it helps gives me some perspective to our contribution to the sport
5973687 ive seen our race as a 3 minute block of time in 1984 but that had a ripple effect on people of future generations the little sisters of rowing
5973688 its given me a belief that when i come up against a tough situation i can make it through it
5973689 with all due respect liberty is not yours to give
5973690 we are just asking the city to protect our freedom to exist
5973691 i went another 12 years and had congestive heart failure i had to have a heart transplant 15 years ago smoking and secondhand smoke was a part of it so they cant convince me that its not dangerous
5973692 for the city to reach into what is essentially our home is an offense to me
5973693 theres no equality in infringing on the rights of others specifically smokers
5973694 delayed flights not only inconvenience travelers and their families but result in tend of billions of dollars in lost revenue and productivity
5973695 anywhere in the world to reach agreement in these big projects takes time
5973696 in a sense its bad news in the short term for alberta because we need the workers but its good for canada because that kind of labour mobility is good for the country
5973697 its a long time coming but its time justice was served
5973698 games are just an important media source and learning source
5973699 we encourage the libraries to try anything that will get teens to love the library whether its book clubs or video games
5973700 the teens just love it and they love to spend their time at the library which is what we wanted
5973701 we consider the content but in the same way we consider books
5973702 anything we purchase may have content that somebody might object to we have a range of video games just as we have a range of books
5973703 ive had a meeting thats all im going to say
5973704 ive met with the fbi and the u s attorneys office
5973705 this trash is being shoveled by the city attorneys political opponents hiding behind a cloak of anonymity
5973706 they have heard the city attorney is thinking of running for attorney general and are engaging in a classic political assassination
5973707 there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports this is evident from its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5973708 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5973709 wir werden jetzt unsere ermittlungen im s dosten der stadt fortsetzen

5973711 in western society the human body establishes the frontier of personal identity while a human being only exists through the bodily shape by which it was brought into the world any modification in their own shape involves another definition of their humanity
5973712 can convey to the arena of western theoretical discussion the concepts and theories implicit if not explicit of non western peoples about bodies and bodiliness
5973713 other oppositions largely alien to japanese thought tend to appear nature culture subject object sociology biology sacred secular
5973714 the body is really there it is even overly present in the pedagogic relationship it parasites the relationship

5973718 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5973719 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5973720 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5973721 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5973722 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5973723 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5973724 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5973725 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5973726 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5973727 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5973728 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5973729 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5973730 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5973731 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5973732 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5973733 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5973734 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5973735 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5973736 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5973737 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5973738 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5973739 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5973740 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5973741 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5973742 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5973743 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5973744 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5973745 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5973746 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5973747 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5973748 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5973749 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5973750 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5973751 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5973752 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5973753 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5973754 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5973755 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5973756 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5973757 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5973758 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5973759 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5973760 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5973761 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5973762 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5973763 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5973764 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5973765 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5973766 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5973767 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5973768 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5973769 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5973770 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5973771 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5973772 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5973773 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5973774 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5973775 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5973776 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5973777 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5973778 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5973779 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5973780 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5973781 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5973782 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5973783 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5973784 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5973785 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5973786 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5973787 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5973788 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5973789 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5973790 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5973791 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5973792 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5973793 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5973794 research on security vulnerabilities and the sensible publication of the results of the research were critical for scientific advancement public safety and a robust market for secure technologies
5973795 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
5973796 the break is over and its time for the last part of the season to start its time to concentrate again on my work
5973797 f1 is a sport which never stops and the team has worked hard to be ready for the race in valencia from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the less there are the more important they become

5973800 information is power especially when delivered in a timely manner
5973801 visa already delivers real time transaction risk scores to financial institutions and we are now empowering cardholders in this pilot with real time transaction alerts participating visa cardholders can typically receive alerts before they walk out of the store rather than hour or even days later
5973802 it was a fairly minor crime with a fairly major consequence
5973803 its probably one of the most unusual things ive heard about in my 20 plus years of law enforcement and a tragic one at that
5973804 i think its very likely that if she had told police where her sister was they would have arrested tate and she wouldnt have been crushed
5973805 im sure that shes agonizing over that decision being her sister
5973806 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5973807 i dont know if were going to look at this or bring it up with the board the alcohol education programs that weve got thats our focus right now
5973808 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5973809 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5973810 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5973811 it will be tight it will be close it is knife edge stuff

5973813 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
5973814 we were last aware that he remained in transit he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
5973815 here comes simon whitfield of canada simon whitfield takes the lead simon whitfield has done it
5973816 its okay to be jumping up and down in your living room
5973817 no beer in the fridge no ice cream in the freezer
5973818 its been 11 months of planning and meeting and passion and energy
5973819 it was time to get to work and get moving on stuff weve been talking about and dreaming about
5973820 that was the answer we were hoping and waiting for
5973821 its nice to know that the city is united in its acceptance of a proposal it sends the right message to investors that lansing is on the right track that theres momentum on our side
5973822 a new one would be nice but im a person who likes history too
5973823 we believe these people are affiliated with the red scorpions gang based in the lower mainland and were trying to establish a dial a dope operation in victoria
5973824 street level dealers were given crack cocaine to sell on behalf of the district managers they shared vehicles they shared a phone number and they worked in shifts
5973825 we certainly believe that weve made a dent in this group of the initial 11 members we identified seven are in custody one is on house arrest in the lower mainland and the other three are facing charges
5973826 all of them are connected and i believe two of them are members
5973827 they are residents of that hotel its an old hotel so people live there
5973828 theres no interior fire protection to slow the fire down its an old old building they dont build buildings like this any more theres lots of wood and whatever in there its very challenging especially when you have to pull back and fight it from the outside
5973829 the fire is still hot and warm we havent begun our police investigation yet well begin that in earnest tomorrow
5973830 so i raced outside was somebody jumping out a window or something but it was luggage being thrown out the second floor window there were three suitcases and a laptop bag
5973831 when we got here there were people on the balcony trying to get out it was going pretty good when our crews arrived
5973832 this is our downtown area so you have residents here you have people staying here who need shelter on a 24 hour basis
5973833 theres so many people involved in her life that theyre putting a big effort into you know showing her whole life and they want to do a good job
5973834 she had a lot a lot of friends theyre going to put all their efforts together and make a really nice life story for her
5973835 she always had a smile on her face she was caring and she was just someone generally people enjoyed she was just a very good wholesome person
5973836 it is a competition after all and the best athlete wins i actually worked as hard as anybody else
5973837 ilchenkos trademark strategy has helped her dominate open water swimming since 2004 winning five consecutive 5k world championships and three consecutive 10k races payne who got weeds stuck in her suit and on her face took the silver in 1 59 40 7
5973838 the last 1 000 meters seemed like another 10k every part of my body was aching
5973839 your stomach is the size of a pea because all the blood rushes to your arms your body is saying stop but your head is saying keep going
5973840 im just annoyed because i didnt get to savor looking up and coming in third because of that negative its unsportsmanship i would never pull on someones legs so i would never assume someone would do it to me but at the end of the day ive got one of these medals and she hasnt so thats enough
5973841 i dont want to say anymore because i dont want to start an inter country war
5973842 it was really crowded going around the corners there was a lot of grabbing and pulling but i have to say i was no angel either
5973843 natalie du toit of south africa an amputee who removed her carbon fiber prosthetic left leg before diving in finished 16th 1 22 2 behind ilchenkos winning time she lost her leg below the knee in a motorcycle accident in 2001
5973844 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied
5973845 hopefully ill be back for 2012 london olympics where ill be hoping for a top five finish
5973846 in one of the few kind gestures shown du toits effort was lauded by her rivals with ilchenko suggesting the south african be given a separate gold medal
5973847 i want to compliment her on being so strong and so brave
5973848 it was a pretty physical race i tried to stay away from a lot of it
5973849 if i wouldve tried to get into a good draft position i wouldve just gotten beat up i was sprinting so long that when people started to speed up i just started to slow down
5973850 i had to clash on numerous occasions especially with the swimmers from brazil
5973851 i was trying to break away from the brazilian girls who were quite aggressive

5973864 its a challenge the campbell liberals are going to have to take on squarely
5973865 they went to arrest him and the fight was on
5973866 full on struggle down to the ground the whole bit it lasted at least a couple of minutes the man was tasered and fortunately that brought the incident to a safe conclusion
5973867 whats important is how can we get this resolved quickly to avoid injury to anyone and thats what happened however many resources it takes to do that thats what well employ
5973868 we believe tasers are safe and effective and in this case thats exactly what happened it was safe and effective and brought this incident to a conclusion it wasnt the first step we took in dealing with this party but it resulted in him being taken into custody without anyone getting hurt
5973869 hes had some run ins that have gone to court in the past but no convictions
5973870 every summer the whole beach season we commonly deal with complaints that arise ranging from theft to minor assault disturbances drinking on the beaches they definitely are crowded so with that comes some extra work for us

5973877 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
5973878 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
5973879 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
5973880 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
5973881 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5973882 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5973883 with every commitment to leave and with every failure to live up to that commitment the international pressure will grow on russia
5973884 a country relies on the word of its president being its bond

5973888 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5973889 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit

5973894 the guitar dominance continues with incredibly fun and large guitar intros devoid of much else other than drums and the occasional fiddle

5973901 the average person in the uk uses over 1000 gallons of water a day making the country one of the biggest water importers in the world
5973902 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5973903 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5973904 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5973905 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5973906 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5973907 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5973908 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5973909 the discipline regarding the denial of holy communion to those obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin

5973911 youre a small squad of elite space marines sent to a galaxy to stave off a massive invasion of epic proportions its the classic 300 the film graphic novel adaptation of the battle of thermopylae scenario
5973912 you begin with 30 guys and you end with those same 30 guys
5973913 i care about my space marine that i took the time to paint myself
5973914 its ok to fail in fact you can fail most of the missions in the campaign and still win the game
5973915 youd just be ranked closer to dan quayle as opposed to augustus
5973916 the tyranids with their hive mind and swarm tactics are all about overwhelming the player in melee combat we actually took a lot of cues from

5973926 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
5973927 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
5973928 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
5973929 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act
5973930 you can have a string quartet but were not sure you can have a dj
5973931 unfortunately no matter the outcome of this trial this schedule alone may not be enough to ensure that senator stevens has the ability to compete meaningfully in the upcoming election
5973932 were venue transferred to alaska senator stevens would have the opportunity to campaign in the evenings and on weekends during the trial
5973933 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
5973934 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
5973935 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
5973936 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
5973937 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
5973938 because i could see it wasnt going anywhere if i didnt do that
5973939 i wouldnt give up because i believe in the man i really do
5973940 maybe i just feel he can put a smile back on the face of the world
5973941 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
5973942 the republicans have taken that first type of patriotism that muscular military rockets red glare type of patriotism and driven that as a wedge against people they see democrats liberals as weak on national security issues
5973943 i think the patriotism question in this case is being wrapped into this larger issue that hes not one of us
5973944 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5973945 it showed that hed put a campaign victory ahead of a military victory
5973946 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5973947 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
5973948 valuable because not everyone sits in front of a computer or a television
5973949 at getting votes on election day and communicating the messages that we feel are important to our supporters
5973950 text messaging is really powerful if i have a text message i can forward that text message to over 100 people in my cell phone list

5973955 a reckless attempt to support a legal action that is without merit and was initiated as retribution for their dismissal from the boss media network
5973956 to be clear player funds are not affected by the current proceedings
5973957 all players funds are held separately under the control of the malta lotteries and gaming authority and cannot be seized by any court
5973958 they have since then repeatedly tried to disrupt the boss media business through the dissemination of groundless rumours
5973959 in april 2008 poker trillion alleged in a press release a claim that among other things boss media player funds where frozen the allegations were false but typical of the type of tactics employed by pokertrillion
5973960 boss media has assured that adequate security is provided in malta in the event of an award of damages against it which we believe be to unlikely

5973965 i think nigeria have a big chance to win the tournament because they have many great players who can turn maybe a draw into a win
5973966 the players are very strong and have a lot of experience to win big competitions because they played together in the world youth championship in 2005
5973967 we are really disappointed with the result we expected more from this game but we played against a very strong team today we know their strength every player is strong and fast and we had difficulty keeping up in the first 30 minutes
5973968 we believe we can make it with the little that we have
5973969 we have always said that we do not have a problem with the people of zimbabwe we have a problem with robert mugabe as we do not recognise him as the president of zimbabwe so the zebras can go and play there
5973970 as the ball came to me i was just thinking of that goal oliseh scored in france 98 and i decided to go for it and i thank god it just went in
5973971 we deserve to be in this final because we have worked very hard to get here and this victory today means so much to me and my team mates
5973972 being in the final is unbelievable and i thank god for that
5973973 i cant take all the glory its all about team work because i couldnt have done it alone it was a team effort and i think the whole team should get the credit
5973974 i am not disgraced about the defeat at all because penalties are a lottery we came up with a plan to neutralise talk talk tshepo motlhabankwe jabu othusitse pilane and pontsho moloi we knew that once we have done that chiefs cannot play and there was no way they could change the system
5973975 it was a tough game and i have respect for gunners because they came prepared we are looking forward to the next game and our aim is to reach the final

5974021 unverh ltnism ig und nicht vereinbar mit der rolle von friedenstruppen sowie unvereinbar mit den prinzipien der gemeinsamen zusammenarbeit zwischen nato und russland

5974026 nous le parti socialiste au moment o nicolas sarkozy a envoy 700 troupes en renfort nous avions d pos une motion de censure
5974027 nous nous interrogions sur le fait de savoir si une strat gie purement militaire dans ce pays au service dune guerre sans but et sans fin
5974028 nous demandons quil y ait le moment venu un d bat et que notamment les ministres comp tents le ministre de la d fense le ministre des affaires trang res le premier ministre viennent sexpliquer les commissions des affaires trang res et de la d fense
5974029 aujourdhui nous sommes devant une impasse militaire qui est totale et durable ce sont les services de renseignement fran ais qui le disent
5974030 nicolas sarkozy avait dit que la pr sence militaire fran aise long terme en afghanistan n tait pas d cisive
5974031 je ne plaide pas pour le retrait des troupes fran aises car je crois quil ne faut pas c der devant les taliban cela dit la question de la r orientation de la strat gie en afghanistan

5974034 if i said that was a great softball game it would be an understatement

5974036 she was coming at me hard she was going to try to beat me with her speed
5974037 a game like today shows the beauty of the sport
5974038 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5974039 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5974040 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5974041 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5974042 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5974043 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5974044 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5974045 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5974046 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5974047 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5974048 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5974049 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5974050 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5974051 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5974052 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto

5974060 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5974061 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5974062 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5974063 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5974064 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5974065 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5974066 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5974067 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5974068 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5974069 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5974070 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5974071 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5974072 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5974073 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5974074 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5974075 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5974076 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5974077 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5974078 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5974079 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5974080 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5974081 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5974082 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5974083 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5974084 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5974085 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5974086 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5974087 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5974088 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5974089 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5974090 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
5974091 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
5974092 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
5974093 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
5974094 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
5974095 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5974096 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5974097 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5974098 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5974099 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5974100 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5974101 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5974102 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5974103 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5974104 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5974105 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5974106 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5974107 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5974108 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5974109 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5974110 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5974111 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5974112 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5974113 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5974114 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5974115 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5974116 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5974117 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5974118 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5974119 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5974120 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5974121 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5974122 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5974123 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5974124 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5974125 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5974126 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5974127 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5974128 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5974129 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5974130 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5974131 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5974132 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5974133 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5974134 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5974135 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5974136 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5974137 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5974138 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5974139 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5974140 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5974141 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5974142 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5974143 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5974144 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5974145 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5974146 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5974147 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5974148 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5974149 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5974150 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5974151 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5974152 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto

5974156 we know shes going to be there and its just like the rest of them shes an enemy
5974157 beckys a friend of mine but all we see is that jersey with russia on it were at war
5974158 i just wanted to stay close enough so in the last 600 or 1 000 meters i could make a move it was a tactical race and not a speed race and i always feel more comfortable being in the top three or four in a tactical race
5974159 its been a little tight ever since ive been over here
5974160 it tightened up with about 350 meters to go and from there i just wanted to hang on ill get some treatment on it and rest up until friday
5974161 it wasnt fun i wasnt getting that runners high but im in the finals and thats all that matters
5974162 were going to let howard play a little left and right get him on the field as much as possible hes having a good camp
5974163 hes a right end no question about it but hes a good pass rusher and were going to work him hes mainly a right end and our inside tackle and nickel guy
5974164 one of my strengths is my versatility i can play anywhere its going to take a couple weeks to get back into it
5974165 everything you did with your right hand you have to learn to do with your left hand
5974166 if youre a guy on the right side and pulling a jersey with your right hand trying to get around the edge you got to learn to do it with your left hand
5974167 its not a matter of quickness once you do something so long you get muscle memory your body does things before you even think about it when you are not used to doing stuff and you have to think about it and then do it you might be a little slower
5974168 you are thinking while youre moving and thinking before you put your hand on the ground
5974169 you get into your stance and try to remember which hand you put down and which foot you move first
5974170 its not just after the snap but before the snap its more rushing the passer and turning the corner instead of using your left hand as your power hand on the run on the offensive tackle you now have to use your right hand
5974171 theres a lot of competition there mcdougle is pushing them
5974172 i picked up the defense i was able to go out and show them some of the things i was able to do its the reason they brought me in here its unfortunate this injury came up
5974173 it seems to me i hear were out of it right now like were not even close
5974174 but the reality is were a game and a half back with six weeks to play
5974175 i feel were the best team in this division we just need to go out there and play like it
5974176 i know the players in the clubhouse ive been with these guys for two years now weve got good players in here weve got guys that can play
5974177 i think somewhere along the line jenkins is going to get hot
5974178 but i like werths talent and the fact that he can hit in the two hole because he hits balls to the right side of the diamond and he can steal bags
5974179 before i got injured i hit second in l a
5974180 i like it if thats where charlie wants to put me in the lineup thats where ill hit
5974181 if he wants to hit me sixth or seventh but how can you not like hitting second in this lineup youve got chase howie ryan howard and pat hitting behind you thats not a bad place to hit really
5974182 if they want to boo me thats fine boo me
5974183 just keep it off everyone else you had some cheers you had some boos like i said when you get the win theyll cheer you
5974184 we were playing just well enough to lose there was just a shift in momentum
5974185 a lot of teams once you start getting in their heads theyll make the errors too you kind of jump on that roller coaster and ride it hold on to it basically thats what we did
5974186 my teammates really rallied behind me i was just making a lot of errors i wasnt really hitting well at all
5974187 we told the players please dont think about the result
5974188 lonely planet is a well known brand amongst travellers and stands for adventure and editorial independence

5974192 were still going to rep booker back there but were going to try and get quintin a majority of the reps
5974193 we kind of had a feeling that it was either going to be lorenzo or quintin
5974194 my confidence has gotten better every day that ive gotten better
5974195 when a question is asked you answer it and you try to answer it correctly
5974196 thats the way he felt and he expressed that some people cant take it some people dont understand what hes talking about he has never backed down from what he said
5974197 people laughed at him when he said they would win the nl east and then as the season continued on everybody started getting excited about it jimmy is a good friend of mine its sad that he has to go through something like this but im sure hell pull himself out of it and they will get that win streak and hopefully be in the world series
5974198 i have noticed no rust he is a natural player its good to have shawn back
5974199 and i did it perfectly i would have no chance to medal if i tried this i might fall but if i could do this i could win a medal i figured it was go big or go home
5974200 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5974201 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5974202 i have the medal and im holding it but its so surreal its a blessing
5974203 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5974204 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5974205 i tried to hold them off and i just couldnt
5974206 rick bosetti achieved a goal of urinating in the outfield of every major league park even though he spent most his career playing in only one league the american
5974207 it did hit home a little for the all around
5974208 honestly i go by everything happens for a reason for some reason the judges werent giving me the normal scores that im used to but they had a reason for it if they saw something we didnt i respect that i was meant to have the silver
5974209 i was proud that she finally got a gold medal now we can both say that were olympic champions that will be really cool
5974210 i competed a full meet about five times the only gymnast on my team to do that i feel ive given everything i have physically and mentally its just the end of the road its normal to feel a little down on the last day because youve given everything and you dont have much left in you
5974211 i was making uncharacteristic mistakes that i havent made in a long time
5974212 i think he was getting nervous just like i was
5974213 i was doing routine after routine without hitting them the way i did in previous competitions he was getting serious he told me to stop and take a second and gather myself
5974214 i felt nervous for myself but i didnt really care how the scores came up and how the placements finished i just wanted to give the best routine i could i didnt want to leave the olympics feeling like i could have done better or i could have ended better i wanted to finish it off as best i could i think i did
5974215 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice
5974216 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5974217 its just a matter of seeing it believing it and just working at it and achieving it
5974218 i won this for her for friends and family but mostly for her
5974219 whats the sense when we dont even know if hes going to play yet
5974220 hes a good player and it certainly doesnt hurt to look
5974221 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5974222 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race
5974223 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5974224 the burlington county interscholastic league the colonial valley conference and the olympic conference will continue to pursue a merger of their member schools for football only as will the cape atlantic league and tri county conference producing two football conferences with multiple divisions

5974233 the rhythm flows through us and we just let it out on the track
5974234 theres no question that those guys are our toughest competitors
5974235 i got pretty upset because since ive been here they have tested me four times and took blood a lot of blood
5974236 they are taking so much blood we are going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
5974237 we have had boys run 10 76 in the 100 and not qualify for our national final
5974238 we have had a lot of very talented youngsters slip through the cracks

5974240 the hardest thing is to make the chase because once you get there the pressures off
5974241 missing the chase would be hard to swallow but were not going to swallow it because were going to make the chase
5974242 if you had asked me before the season if it wouldve been a distraction i wouldve said no but i was proven wrong
5974243 he does a good job on defense and calling the game and handling the pitchers
5974244 but at the same time hes got to be better than a 220 hitter
5974245 weve had a lot of things said about fans here
5974246 a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
5974247 it gives us a little more balance in the lineup
5974248 gets a big hit now and then i think what hes hitting he can hit more hes got a good swing but at times hes not very aggressive he needs to be more aggressive
5974249 the mystery behind paris hiltons big boobs has been solved and no it doesnt involve plastic surgery
5974250 mondays are different in the delaware valley after an eagles loss
5974251 you can see it in peoples faces and after an eagles win you can see people almost walking on air theyre so happy it could be pouring on the monday after an eagles win but the sun is always shining the fans here are so tied emotionally to these teams
5974252 they come from the same psychological mechanism its why its possible to switch so quickly from cheering to booing we have high expectations we feel huge highs and suffer terrible lows
5974253 if we were kicking butt and winning championships people would be a little more relaxed
5974254 but theres no doubt that people have a chip on their shoulders because they have to hear new york and their mess about were new york and whatever
5974255 i think some worry that if the game is on tv and they dont boo people watching will be disappointed
5974256 its almost expected so we have to deliver and if they boo and it isnt loud enough people are disappointed but so long as it isnt disruptive its also plain old fun its tradition
5974257 theyre in there playing the game in their heads theyre on the field its a love hate relationship think about your own life there are people who you adore and theyre the same people you fight the most with they dont feel like theyre a spectator watching a sport they feel like theyre your friend youre the hardest on the people you love the most
5974258 that suggests to me that were a much healthier city than some people think we dont bottle our emotions were not aloof some other cities its not that they bottle their emotions its that the emotions arent even there

5974280 es ist jedenfalls h chst an der zeit dass den orangen herrschaften ihre intellektuellen grenzen vor allem im gesundheitsbereich den die sozialdemokratie zu einem der besten weltweit gemacht hat bewusst werden und sie nicht l nger auf kosten der menschen versuchen politisches kapital zu gewinnen

5974288 the unmc eppley cancer center is extremely grateful to mike simmonds and everyone at simmonds restaurant management that work so hard on this campaign said ken cowan m d ph d director of the unmc eppley cancer center
5974289 by supporting the beat cancer for kids campaign over the last five years the generous people of omaha and surrounding communities have helped raise more than half a million dollars for research in childhood cancers at unmc
5974290 were moving into a new era in developing new tailored drugs so theyre more effective safer and less toxic
5974291 the community has been so incredibly generous in this campaign from burger king to each of our contributing sponsors to every person that is touched by the real need to help children and their families
5974292 cancer indiscriminately affects people that we care about our neighbors our classmates our coworkers and our relatives
5974293 its hard to imagine that one dollar can really influence cancer research but because of burger kings commitment to families this campaign is making an impact on finding the best ways to diagnose and treat childhood cancers
5974294 the first crews arrived within four minutes and found heavy smoke coming from vents in the exterior of the three storey brick building with several people trapped at the windows on the second and third floors
5974295 six people were rescued using ladders crews then attempted to enter the building to perform search and rescue and encountered tremendous heat smoke and fire conditions within a few feet of the front door
5974296 a thorough search of the scene will be performed when entry is possible
5974297 i dont know why they didnt find me the first time
5974298 they couldnt find him but we knew he was in there
5974299 we contacted a police officer we knew and he agreed to help us get inside again we told them he was in the office so they went in and found him
5974300 we will have to get plywood put up over the front entrance
5974301 we are actually lucky because we have another location at the redwood square that we can use and this is not tax season so the impact should not be significant for us
5974302 i heard some shouting from time to time on third avenue but in this neighbourhood it is not uncommon to hear shouting even at 6 in the morning

5974312 we expect continued supply issues but the situation is definitely getting better
5974313 its a hard game for them to play trying to predict how many phones they are going to sell and ultimately they are going to say its a good problem for them but we say it would be better not to have that problem at all
5974314 we have been quickly selling all the supplies we get
5974315 they have been using best buy pretty extensively with the macintosh
5974316 and the fact that they are going forward with that signals that they are pretty confident that the supply is going to be adequate
5974317 they have a much more complex supply chain than they had in the past
5974318 they are just having trouble figuring out where to put those things

5974333 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5974334 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5974335 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5974336 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5974337 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5974338 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5974339 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5974340 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5974341 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

5974357 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5974358 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5974359 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5974360 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5974361 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5974362 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5974363 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5974364 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5974365 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5974366 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5974367 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5974368 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5974369 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5974370 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5974371 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5974372 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5974373 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5974374 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5974375 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5974376 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5974377 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5974378 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5974379 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5974380 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5974381 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5974382 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5974383 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5974384 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5974385 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5974386 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5974387 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5974388 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5974389 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5974390 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5974391 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5974392 were not hawking viagra so dont worry our email campaigns arent that bad but we also affirm the use of double opt in email lists to assure that customers who are truly interested in our online gaming products get the right emails
5974393 i personally believe online gaming marketing practices of today that are thought of as inappropriate will be the future of tomorrows online gaming industry leaders
5974394 we need to stick to our guns and abide by best practice methods in order to preserve the integrity of the online gaming industry as a whole if we degrade ourselves by using cheap marketing practices to make a quick buck we will only be hurting ourselves in the long run
5974395 everyone in this online gaming sector knows how to blast out email notices fliers etc to people but not everyone knows how to do this in an efficient manner that creates profit margin efficieny in our industry is absolutely key
5974396 i truly believe that our customers not regulatory agencies are the best source of online gaming marketing feedback face it if were not making money and our customers are pissed off our marketing methods are wrong and not productive dont forget that private companies are in the business to make cash and dont make a profit banging their heads against the walls
5974397 do you as business leaders and executives make sure that your books are 100 accurate and sound or do you leave this task to your respective accounting agencies
5974398 i see to it that all our data is accurate
5974399 but i trust our finance department to crunch the numbers correctly and report accurately at the end of the day it is my job to move the business forward not be a slave to my calculator and exel spreadsheets
5974400 top executives from the deason denman corporate firm also were present sitting toward the front of the auditorium and listened closely to the online gaming discussion
5974401 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
5974402 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
5974403 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
5974404 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
5974405 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
5974406 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5974407 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5974408 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5974409 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5974410 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5974411 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5974412 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5974413 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5974414 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5974415 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5974416 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5974417 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5974418 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5974419 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5974420 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5974421 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5974422 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5974423 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5974424 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5974425 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5974426 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5974427 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5974428 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5974429 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5974430 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5974431 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

5974438 on the whole all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words
5974439 i think we should still engage with the russians but in a hard headed way and we mustnt allow the russians to feel they are the victims of this affair when they are the transgressors
5974440 for the withdrawal of russian troops to happen two things are necessary the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again russias ambassador to the united nations vitaly churkin said

5974480 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5974481 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal

5974485 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5974486 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5974487 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5974488 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5974489 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5974490 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5974491 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5974492 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many

5974523 shadow chancellor george osborne is set to claim the conservatives are the party best placed to tackle poverty and create a fair society in a speech to the think tank demos he is also expected to accuse gordon brown of burdening future generations by reckless government borrowing
5974524 t he modern conservative party is now winning the argument that the best way to achieve progressive goals is through conservative means

5974528 it may be that the growing inevitability of a tory victory will enable mr cameron to put on the record that unless he seeks to retake powers over interest rates exchange rates and prices and incomes modern governments in free democracies are largely economically impotent telling voters what they do not wish to hear is the bane of politics but such modesty now may serve to re educate voters that when the next downturn occurs on the tories watch it wont be mr camerons fault

5974548 there remains the concern that the us experience might presage steep housing downturns in other countries that have also experienced a rapid rise in house prices with associated risks for output growth
5974549 annual house price inflation in london was 17 4 in august down from 19 1 in july
5974550 we have been expecting a slowdown in monthly lending levels in line with interest rate rises
5974551 in the coming months we expect to see monthly lending levels dip below their 2006 levels for the first time this year as rate effects are exacerbated by the recent liquidity problems in the mortgage market
5974552 a major correction in the market seems unlikely while economic growth is above trend and employment conditions remain buoyant
5974553 the combination of rising interest rates the introduction of home information packs hips and volatility in the financial markets resulting in tightening of lending criteria has certainly affected the confidence of buyers and sellers

5974560 the rest of the withdrawn deals can only be attributed to many lenders making more minor changes to their ranges

5974565 if we dont solve the problem luang prabang will be out of the list of world heritage sites
5974566 world heritage is still new for us and our biggest challenge is making local people understand the need to preserve cultural heritage and how this impacts on development
5974567 some people ask why we should preserve heritage if it means we cannot develop but i dont think heritage preservation delays our development on the contrary it encourages development
5974568 now we have two world heritage listed sites luang prabang and vat phou champassak in champassak province but we wont propose any more sites to unesco until we improve the existing ones
5974569 we will assess what we have done and try to address challenges we have many sites to be proposed to unesco but we want to study them carefully first
5974570 we believe that such a transfer is not in the interest of the public
5974571 you are giving the land to a private land trust that isnt necessarily open to the public or public influence and there is no guarantee this land trust is going to keep the door open to the public you are giving it to a land trust set up by a developer that stands to make bucket loads of money if the toll road goes through

5974609 when we recently underwent an extensive renovation we were looking for just this type of enhancement to better serve our traveling guests with the uncertainties surrounding air travel today providing guests with accurate airline information fills a much needed gap and adds confidence to their travel plans
5974610 installing flyte systems has really helped my staff before flyte they received a tremendous number of requests to go upstairs and print out boarding passes from the computers in the business center the lobby location is so much more convenient since guests can quickly duck out of meetings and glance at the flyteboard to see if their flight is on time and then print out boarding passes
5974611 we care about our guests and we were confident flyteboard was something that would help our business travelers once we roll out flytechannel our guests will not have to leave the comfort of their rooms until they have to

5974613 even if there was total calm my mind wouldnt be at rest i still believe that the government is not doing all it needs to be doing in terms of fortification even the ongoing budget debates shouldnt interfere with the fortification efforts

5974620 when i went to plant the pole in the bucket my heart was beating so fast its been such a journey you think about that to jumping where i am now its unheard of
5974621 im glad its over it was just more pressure than you could imagine the anxiety the intense training and everything else
5974622 and thats what ive been thinking about thats pretty cool
5974623 theres always an upward spiral because im learning how to run better with the pole im learning more competitive meet strategy and more technical stuff

5974625 isinbayeva is as dominant as any track and field athlete and maybe as dominant as any athlete in any sport
5974626 the whole world wants some sort of a rivalry for isinbayeva it could be anybody it just so happens that jenns the closest so its jenn right now
5974627 it is what it is its the russian american thing so the theme fits but i dont think its fair to compare them isinbayeva is the best theres ever been but jenn actually took much less time to clear 15 and 16 feet she developed more rapidly i think they both have something left in the tank so well see where this all goes
5974628 i had to force meets in the past i had to jump all over europe to establish herself and make money i dont have to force it any more right now i can be more selective and go in healthy and strong
5974629 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5974630 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5974631 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5974632 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5974633 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5974634 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5974635 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5974636 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5974637 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5974638 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5974639 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5974640 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month

5974642 all too often an employee reward and recognition program is an entitlement program that happens the same way year after year for no other reason than that is how the casino has always done it
5974643 but this program is an important follow up step to employee guest service training employees who actively demonstrate the lessons learned in training should be recognized and rewarded for doing so this gives employees the incentive to continue to do their best thus the reward and recognition program should be evaluated to be certain it is an effective one

5974673 the thieves were clearly opportunists they knew the flat would be empty and used it to their advantage to enter the shop without attracting attention there was no sign of forced entry apart from the side gate being broken but being opposite a police station obviously doesnt protect you
5974674 the thieves carefully moved the furniture and oak floorboards in the flat which has been unoccupied for months to break into the shop
5974675 they smashed and threw the till across the shop they also smashed open and emptied a cabinet of cigarettes and stole two games consoles and a satellite navigation system from under the counter

5974679 the physical distance between the station and the crime scene bears no relation to the dispatching of officers as crimes are logged centrally an officer was sent to miss fedrick at the next available opportunity 11 30am
5974680 we are awaiting forensic results from the scene but there are no suspects at this stage

5974685 most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection
5974686 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5974687 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources
5974688 this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5974689 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify

5974775 junkies and pushers dont belong near children and families they should be in rehab or behind bars
5974776 there is growing evidence that harm reduction efforts can have a positive effect on the poor health outcomes associated with drug use
5974777 is it true that supervised injections offer positive health outcomes i would not put it this way insite vancouvers safe injection site may slow the death spiral of a deadly drug habit but it does not reverse it i do not regard this as a positive health outcome
5974778 minister is off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians
5974779 we have an opinion based on scientific evidence the minister has come to a different conclusion
5974780 ive never seen such an offensive performance by a health minister
5974781 how dare he come to a meeting of professionals and scold them about their perceived ethical failings

5974790 were going to let howard play a little left and right get him on the field as much as possible hes having a good camp
5974791 hes a right end no question about it but hes a good pass rusher and were going to work him hes mainly a right end and our inside tackle and nickel guy
5974792 one of my strengths is my versatility i can play anywhere its going to take a couple weeks to get back into it
5974793 everything you did with your right hand you have to learn to do with your left hand
5974794 if youre a guy on the right side and pulling a jersey with your right hand trying to get around the edge you got to learn to do it with your left hand
5974795 its not a matter of quickness once you do something so long you get muscle memory your body does things before you even think about it when you are not used to doing stuff and you have to think about it and then do it you might be a little slower
5974796 you are thinking while youre moving and thinking before you put your hand on the ground
5974797 you get into your stance and try to remember which hand you put down and which foot you move first
5974798 its not just after the snap but before the snap its more rushing the passer and turning the corner instead of using your left hand as your power hand on the run on the offensive tackle you now have to use your right hand
5974799 theres a lot of competition there mcdougle is pushing them
5974800 i picked up the defense i was able to go out and show them some of the things i was able to do its the reason they brought me in here its unfortunate this injury came up
5974801 ive spent most of my professional career optimistically following big bull markets those were happy days which id like to see again but the world situation denies that possibility
5974802 where can i find an australian i have an urgent need to talk about sport

5974804 our relationship with india in the same manner is not counterproductive to pakistan
5974805 india provided a good educational environment for afghans i was one of them and there are a thousand more like me in india now afghanistan wants this relationship and we hope that pakistan evolves into a good relationship with india as well

5974812 it seems to me i hear were out of it right now like were not even close
5974813 but the reality is were a game and a half back with six weeks to play
5974814 i feel were the best team in this division we just need to go out there and play like it
5974815 i know the players in the clubhouse ive been with these guys for two years now weve got good players in here weve got guys that can play
5974816 i think somewhere along the line jenkins is going to get hot
5974817 but i like werths talent and the fact that he can hit in the two hole because he hits balls to the right side of the diamond and he can steal bags
5974818 before i got injured i hit second in l a
5974819 i like it if thats where charlie wants to put me in the lineup thats where ill hit
5974820 if he wants to hit me sixth or seventh but how can you not like hitting second in this lineup youve got chase howie ryan howard and pat hitting behind you thats not a bad place to hit really
5974821 if they want to boo me thats fine boo me
5974822 just keep it off everyone else you had some cheers you had some boos like i said when you get the win theyll cheer you
5974823 i just wanted to stay close enough so in the last 600 or 1 000 meters i could make a move it was a tactical race and not a speed race and i always feel more comfortable being in the top three or four in a tactical race
5974824 its been a little tight ever since ive been over here
5974825 it tightened up with about 350 meters to go and from there i just wanted to hang on ill get some treatment on it and rest up until friday
5974826 it wasnt fun i wasnt getting that runners high but im in the finals and thats all that matters
5974827 we were playing just well enough to lose there was just a shift in momentum
5974828 a lot of teams once you start getting in their heads theyll make the errors too you kind of jump on that roller coaster and ride it hold on to it basically thats what we did
5974829 my teammates really rallied behind me i was just making a lot of errors i wasnt really hitting well at all
5974830 we told the players please dont think about the result
5974831 were still going to rep booker back there but were going to try and get quintin a majority of the reps
5974832 we kind of had a feeling that it was either going to be lorenzo or quintin
5974833 my confidence has gotten better every day that ive gotten better
5974834 when a question is asked you answer it and you try to answer it correctly
5974835 thats the way he felt and he expressed that some people cant take it some people dont understand what hes talking about he has never backed down from what he said
5974836 people laughed at him when he said they would win the nl east and then as the season continued on everybody started getting excited about it jimmy is a good friend of mine its sad that he has to go through something like this but im sure hell pull himself out of it and they will get that win streak and hopefully be in the world series
5974837 i have noticed no rust he is a natural player its good to have shawn back
5974838 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5974839 i have the medal and im holding it but its so surreal its a blessing
5974840 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5974841 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5974842 i tried to hold them off and i just couldnt
5974843 it did hit home a little for the all around
5974844 honestly i go by everything happens for a reason for some reason the judges werent giving me the normal scores that im used to but they had a reason for it if they saw something we didnt i respect that i was meant to have the silver
5974845 i was proud that she finally got a gold medal now we can both say that were olympic champions that will be really cool
5974846 i competed a full meet about five times the only gymnast on my team to do that i feel ive given everything i have physically and mentally its just the end of the road its normal to feel a little down on the last day because youve given everything and you dont have much left in you
5974847 i was making uncharacteristic mistakes that i havent made in a long time
5974848 i think he was getting nervous just like i was
5974849 i was doing routine after routine without hitting them the way i did in previous competitions he was getting serious he told me to stop and take a second and gather myself
5974850 i felt nervous for myself but i didnt really care how the scores came up and how the placements finished i just wanted to give the best routine i could i didnt want to leave the olympics feeling like i could have done better or i could have ended better i wanted to finish it off as best i could i think i did
5974851 i really dont know what i would look at there that were really missing i look at the games and i feel really good at where we stand from a portfolio point of view the online service theres nothing really there that i can really point to that i wish we had the innovation that the wii is im certainly a big fan of
5974852 my resignation as president does not reflect my defeat as i resigned in the interest of pakistan and its people
5974853 he does a good job on defense and calling the game and handling the pitchers
5974854 but at the same time hes got to be better than a 220 hitter
5974855 weve had a lot of things said about fans here
5974856 a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
5974857 it gives us a little more balance in the lineup
5974858 gets a big hit now and then i think what hes hitting he can hit more hes got a good swing but at times hes not very aggressive he needs to be more aggressive
5974859 im used to playing injured it wont stop me from getting on the court theres a bit of pain when i take off and land a bit but ill have to play through that
5974860 its just a matter of seeing it believing it and just working at it and achieving it
5974861 i won this for her for friends and family but mostly for her
5974862 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice
5974863 the rhythm flows through us and we just let it out on the track
5974864 theres no question that those guys are our toughest competitors
5974865 i got pretty upset because since ive been here they have tested me four times and took blood a lot of blood
5974866 they are taking so much blood we are going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
5974867 we have had boys run 10 76 in the 100 and not qualify for our national final
5974868 we have had a lot of very talented youngsters slip through the cracks
5974869 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5974870 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race
5974871 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging

5974901 its not a popular issue these days why do you think politicians in the past like whitman and mcgreevey increased the debt because the public doesnt care about it
5974902 not a herculean step were not claiming weve solved every problem the idea is that we make these kinds of choices on a regular basis about how we budget and manage our finances we will get ourselves back into a strong position
5974903 each day you get closer to election day 2009 it makes it tougher and tougher to deal with these complicated issues
5974904 we never ruled out that there could be more than one person responsible
5974905 youre going to continue seeing increased uniform patrol as well as the mini stations out along frankford avenue
5974906 but we cant allow them to control us we have to dictate the direction
5974907 the men in our community should step up and do a better job at protecting us
5974908 quindi bambina non credere a niente che non sia amore
5974909 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
5974910 valuable because not everyone sits in front of a computer or a television
5974911 at getting votes on and communicating the messages that we feel are important to our supporters
5974912 its going to be read by every single person have you ever not read a text message
5974913 i think the patriotism question in this case is being wrapped into this larger issue that hes not one of us
5974914 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5974915 it showed that hed put a campaign victory ahead of a military victory
5974916 unfortunately no matter the outcome of this trial this schedule alone may not be enough to ensure that has the ability to compete meaningfully in the upcoming election
5974917 were venue transferred to alaska senator stevens would have the opportunity to campaign in the evenings and on weekends during the trial
5974918 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
5974919 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
5974920 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
5974921 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
5974922 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
5974923 because i could see it wasnt going anywhere if i didnt do that
5974924 i wouldnt give up because i believe in the man i really do
5974925 maybe i just feel he can put a smile back on the face of the world
5974926 i am having a blast there at the olympic village
5974927 the workers have been pretty aggressive about getting autographs and photos but the other athletes have respected me its a different experience than staying in a hotel
5974928 its just a matter of seeing it believing it and just working at it and achieving it the guy who went 0 1 at the world championships just won the olympic title
5974929 bob and i are starting up a new business back in baltimore with the pool that we just bought
5974930 so were going to make some adjustments and see what we can do to take that sport to the next level
5974931 i won this for her for friends and family but mostly for her
5974932 mondays are different in the delaware valley after an eagles loss
5974933 you can see it in peoples faces and after an eagles win you can see people almost walking on air theyre so happy it could be pouring on the monday after an eagles win but the sun is always shining the fans here are so tied emotionally to these teams
5974934 they come from the same psychological mechanism its why its possible to switch so quickly from cheering to booing we have high expectations we feel huge highs and suffer terrible lows
5974935 if we were kicking butt and winning championships people would be a little more relaxed
5974936 but theres no doubt that people have a chip on their shoulders because they have to hear new york and their mess about were new york and whatever
5974937 i think some worry that if the game is on tv and they dont boo people watching will be disappointed
5974938 its almost expected so we have to deliver and if they boo and it isnt loud enough people are disappointed but so long as it isnt disruptive its also plain old fun its tradition
5974939 theyre in there playing the game in their heads theyre on the field its a love hate relationship think about your own life there are people who you adore and theyre the same people you fight the most with they dont feel like theyre a spectator watching a sport they feel like theyre your friend youre the hardest on the people you love the most
5974940 that suggests to me that were a much healthier city than some people think we dont bottle our emotions were not aloof some other cities its not that they bottle their emotions its that the emotions arent even there
5974941 im going to do whatever it takes with an all out full effort to get sen barack obama elected president of the united states
5974942 other than sen clinton herself i was tremendously disappointed she was not the nominee
5974943 if she is enthusiastic about sen obama then all the clinton supporters should be enthusiastic about sen obama we all need to grow up and get ready for a historic general election and pull together as good democrats
5974944 it is also very important for the supporters of sen obama to extend their hand of friendship relationship and partnership and healing to make it that much easier
5974945 it is a way to motivate and activate people and get them ready for what basically is a bit of a sprint leading to election day
5974946 what i shared with them is sen obama will ultimately get a little extra effort from me in the general election because as much as i was 101 percent for clinton in the primary i was not against sen obama i was just for sen clinton in the general election i am for sen obama more than 101 percent and i am against sen john mccain so it is a heightened support
5974947 we are going to use the mayor to give speeches coordinate field efforts and probably do things outside of philly too he is very popular
5974948 to carry pennsylvania barack obama is going to need a huge margin out of philadelphia
5974949 weve essentially put a dent now in the coatesville drug trade
5974950 its not going to be business as usual anymore so if people felt comfortable doing the drug dealing out in the open i dont think that they should feel that way from this point forward
5974951 this sends a message to the community that were on top of it
5974952 what we want to do is clear the streets so that the citizens can take control of the streets and so that we can once again ask our citizens to participate in the criminal justice system without fear
5974953 and its crystal clear mayah her 6 year old daughter was in for an hour and a half its the first time shes gone all the way in
5974954 it would be 84 degrees on the beach and people wouldnt be going in the water only the young people would come up and say why is the ocean cold
5974955 but the upwelling temperature is going to be warmer than it was in june the people wont be freezing their butts off but itll be cooler than it was
5974956 jump right in and wouldnt be in for more than a minute and a half
5974957 now you can come in we can figure out where you are in reading whether you need social support services whether you need child care
5974958 the nordstrom of student services every young person is going to be greeted with a smile and treated like the adults they are
5974959 as a city we are not going to be able to get where we need to go without fixing this problem
5974960 the message that 30 000 kids on the street today need to hear is weve created a place for you
5974961 just imagine how many young adults need a hand to move forward
5974962 to me it was clear you had to jump on those
5974963 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
5974964 we did establish a fixed date for the next election
5974965 the fact of the matter what we will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament
5974966 its not my job to go into an election because the prime minister asked me to go into an election my job is to replace him and timing is important
5974967 to listen to some in the arts community and the opposition you would think that theres blood in the streets
5974968 were trying to minimize the impact on people but its not easy because the work is invasive
5974969 i havent been able to get to my street for a month
5974970 this is such a big player in the regional economy this is the workhorse to know that its strong and vital thats a big deal
5974971 it is time to act change is both necessary and inevitable
5974972 it is a source of shame that we have over a million patients waiting for care and five million without a family doctor
5974973 competition consumer choice and market principles barely exist in our health system
5974974 in terms of value for money we are dead last 30th out of 30 in the organization for economic co operation and development
5974975 the private public rhetoric on health care is a relic of tedious and tiresome propaganda those who argue against and demonize the private sector need a reality check
5974976 the players play but dont agree with what gullit does
5974977 now i dont hate them any more not these particular guys i hate and detest the leaders some guards would just come in and do their job when they were told to beat you they would come in and do it some seemed to get a big bang out of it a lot of them were homosexual although never toward us some who were pretty damned sadistic seemed to get a big thrill out of the beatings
5974978 someguyiveneverheardof com is reporting presumptive democratic nominee barack obama has lady parts obviously scurrilous and unfounded well examine it tonight in our special barack obamas vagina the october surprise in his pants
5974979 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us
5974980 i dont want to be a member of the house of lords
5974981 i will not accept it my wife pauline would quite like me to accept it but why should i be sidelined to the lords when i could do so much more for the labour movement
5974982 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment of muslims
5974983 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
5974984 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
5974985 there should be no question in our country of choosing between bear and man
5974986 its annoying to see celebrities sponsoring the bears without understanding the consequences
5974987 we do not give a hoot about the views of parisians civil servants or the wife of the president
5974988 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
5974989 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
5974990 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
5974991 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act
5974992 you can have a string quartet but were not sure you can have a dj
5974993 were going to try to get quintin a majority of the reps
5974994 im never uncomfortable catching passes because ive done it before ive never done that before so im just a little more excited to make a play because you want to prove to yourself first that you can do it you forget the small stuff when you get excited it was one of those games i made kick return look like it was rocket science
5974995 i guess i might be a little biased because hes a safety but ive liked what ive seen demps do
5974996 i think hes a playmaker back there in the secondary hes going to have to work on his eyes a little bit hes in the backfield too much but i think thats because hes always trying to make a play on the ball i think hes a guy that has impressed me with his athleticism also
5974997 he has the right mentality for it hes not a prima donna nothing like that he comes in and he works hard
5974998 he adds so much to your return game in terms of speed and ability
5974999 get it and go thats what youve got to do punt return more of a little hesitation to see where the hole might be kickoff return youve got to catch it and get vertical
5975000 youve got to find a thin line between your responsibility and looking at the quarterback so long
5975001 being young you try to make a play so much thats all you try to do is make a play for me coming from college thats all i did was stare into the backfield and make plays by anticipating throws you cant do that in this league man its totally impossible its too fast the speed is too much and youve got to be technique sound
5975002 its the hardest thing for a young defensive back to come into the league with all the little techniques
5975003 quintins going to be a good football player hes got some habits and were correcting that one of the corrections is to make sure he concentrates on the receivers hes in a learning process too its going to take him a little while but im very happy with quintin
5975004 you have to have an individual who first of all you trust to do both and then that individual has to be of a mind set to not be afraid to do one or the other
5975005 some people are afraid to get into contact so thats why safety is out for them and some people are scared to get out there in corner what we call the highway out there because of that speed
5975006 it takes an individual with athletic ability absolutely but you have to have a mental toughness about you also to be able to step out there and line up against receivers out there on that highway and hold your own ive always given every corner that ive played with i give them a whole bunch of credit for lining up out there and doing what they do its a grown mans job at any given time you can get taken deep and you have to have a short memory to be able to line up again
5975007 whats the sense when we dont even know if hes going to play yet
5975008 hes a good player and it certainly doesnt hurt to look
5975009 he looks pretty good hes an excellent player i have noticed no rust
5975010 he is a natural player hes a big guy strong very fast very quick he plays the game natural meaning with instinctive athleticism he plays it naturally low he can bend his knees and he plays the game low its good to have shawn back hes working hard and preparing hard well see what happens here i would expect him to play very well
5975011 im not exactly where i would normally be at this point in camp
5975012 i would normally be in better football shape theres no type of running in the world that you can possibly do to match with football i trained with a 20 pound vest this offseason still once you put the pads on and everything else its different its a lot different
5975013 i do feel like myself im getting back into it mentally i know all my plays physically i feel pretty good id like to think im playing at new england but well see
5975014 but it doesnt surprise you because you see stuff like that in baseball all the time
5975015 im figuring two grand in camden aint gonna cut it too much
5975016 we were going to have to live with my parents
5975017 i thought maybe ill get another eye looking at me
5975018 youre hanging on every pitch one run means everything youre not going to get any tougher situation
5975019 ive only had a couple of people say boo back to me
5975020 it still hurts a little that he used the word front runners book said had evolved into what he said was a sincere attempt to get fans at the ballpark to be more positive
5975021 you had some cheers you had some boos i guess
5975022 thats what i said it was pretty much going to be again like i said if we get the win theyll be cheering
5975023 i was speaking for a lot of guys i wasnt just speaking for ryan ryans had his share ive had my share pat burrell has had his share i think chase utley hasnt been touched and hopefully it remains that way
5975024 a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
5975025 but it could have been worse in my opinion i saw people standing up for j roll i heard some claps even though its pretty hard to hear way up here
5975026 im glad i did it im still hoping it catches on some more i mean who knows
5975027 hes got some power he can catch and throw and calls a good game
5975028 hes been trying to hit the ball the other way and stay through the ball and hes getting better at that hes cut down on his strikeouts hes a veteran guy
5975029 he does a good job on defense calling the game and handling the pitchers
5975030 at the same time were not hitting hes got to be better than a 220 hitter but if everyone was hitting i think ruiz would be hitting more if everyone else was hitting we wouldnt even be talking about ruiz
5975031 i think it would be asking a lot of a young catcher and it might be a lot to ask of a veteran catcher
5975032 some guys have that knack but those guys might be hard to find
5975033 typically with veteran guys it would be much easier to do if you can catch you can catch its just a matter of how much information you can retain from the pitching coach and other sources besides if we bring a catcher in it doesnt mean hes going to play every day
5975034 it will give us another guy on the bench greg dobbs or eric bruntlett and feliz defense
5975035 this guy can get some big hits for you i think he can hit more if we work with him a little bit more and the more confidence he gets i think hell hit more id like to see him get more aggressive and be more consistent with his swing
5975036 all the information that we get those scouts sit up there for a reason
5975037 the biggest difference i see you see guys chasing balls in the dirt chasing balls out of the strike zone things like that to me thats the difference
5975038 thats how you go to school on the hitter until you make adjustments more than likely theyre going to stay there some teams pitch us different but the majority of them throw us slow stuff before when they came at us with hard stuff wed light them up
5975039 i think it reconfirms that mr chr tien and the liberals have always pursued a policy in this area calculated to their own personal financial interests and those of rich and powerful friends
5975040 its no mistake that mr chr tien was calculating his retirement income in his relations in this area it was a few weeks after he left the premiership that he was being signed on as a consultant to multinational companies with commercial interests in this area
5975041 mr chr tien was just stating the obvious he believes in engagement with china just as the canadian business community believes in engagement
5975042 whether its human rights or business its better talking with china than insulting mr chr tien
5975043 at the bottom of the ladder in terms of having any influence with china
5975044 the approach mr harper has taken is that our foreign policy in general will be governed by canadas values and interests he doesnt sit around calculating anybodys financial interests for himself or close friends when deciding to do the right thing

5975046 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5975047 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5975048 i was already getting up and elated coming off the turn
5975049 you read the papers they say we have no chance even in the nfc
5975050 but it really doesnt matter what people say as long as the 53 guys we go into the season with believe in ourselves and we go out there and play giants football well be fine i know a lot of people are saying theres no michael strahan no jeremy shockey no gibril wilson no kawika mitchell but weve got guys who stepped in last year and played a lot they will continue to do that and i feel confident in our coaching staff and the people we have around here to get it done
5975051 we had one pro bowler last year osi umenyiora defensive end was our only pro bowler so were not sexy we dont have all the big names and that kind of stuff
5975052 were kind of a blue collar team and i think it does put a little bit of a chip on our shoulder to hear people say you know what last year was a fairy tale itll never happen again well these guys want to prove that it can
5975053 were definitely going to miss him said umenyiora who had a career high 13 sacks last season six of which came in a 16 3 week 4 win over the eagles
5975054 whenever you take a hall of famer out of your defense its going to affect you tremendously he was a great player i dont know if anybody is going to be able to step up the way he played we have good football players but were talking about michael strahan here
5975055 having those two guys on the outside was tremendously important
5975056 it was basically pick your poison you had three guys that can get after the quarterback obviously we didnt sack him every time but just having that threat that capability gets a quarterback off his timing off his rhythm
5975057 you could tell the week of the super bowl how we felt said umenyiora
5975058 we felt we could beat that football team we felt we could get to brady when we played them in week 17 we hit him 17 times they had a very good offensive line but we felt we were a better defensive line so we just went out there and tried to do what we do
5975059 we still have a lot of people who can rush the passer umenyiora said
5975060 you take michael out of the equation obviously youre losing a great player but i think kiwanuka can rush the passer so can dave tollefson we have some guys who can step in there and do a good job
5975061 it really calmed me down it made me think you can give any little extra energy any piece of yourself you have left you dont have to save anything johnson said
5975062 going into that last routine i didnt care what score i got i just wanted to hit the best routine i could to finish off my experience and not have any regrets
5975063 i didnt want to leave here thinking i could have done better finishing off that routine knowing i hit the best routine i could at the time it felt amazing
5975064 she tumbles on the beam like other people tumble on the floor
5975065 we are here because we must find a way to re engage these students for one reason or another we are not successful
5975066 were about just moving on and getting the work done with these young people
5975067 we expect to serve everybody here like the nordstroms of student services
5975068 so any young person that walks in that door will be welcomed with a smile and treated like the adults that they are
5975069 this is not a place where were going to give you a phone number and say go make the call yourself
5975070 this is necessary because not all youth are determined to get out there and search and find the education that is needed
5975071 this re engagement center is a wonderful idea it lets students know that there is a better way instead of dropping out of school and feeling lost
5975072 theres a lot of kids out there who feel as though theres no place for them theres no hope and that the school district has failed them and they have failed themselves
5975073 they need to know that there is a place for them
5975074 i did some proper analysis of the whole tinfoil hat thing youd need almost a full helmet a nice thick grounding chain and preferably an electrified mesh to make it work properly the straight tinfoil doesnt make your brain unreadable it amplifies the signals makes it so much easier to read if i didnt know better id say that state seeded this whole tinfoil hat to protect you from mind control rays into popular culture precisely to catch the less scientifically minded subversive
5975075 as long as you dont re edit any of my documents i cant see any reason for you not to publish the writing style has been mangled so they cant trace it to any of my openly available works
5975076 i do have one thing which i havent committed to encryption yet hows your shorthand
5975077 yes the big five our home grown three letter agencies new earth shan nova tar and the coalition
5975078 you do anyway if one of them is actively probing you you can reinforce the waveform in a clandestine manner its untraceable the scanners think youre just one of the sheeple it uses five concepts that are prevalent in the propaganda they feed us to set up a loop they can read our minds to a fair degree of accuracy but ten billion minds produces a lot of noise the scanners are almost entirely automated and so depend on pattern recognition the self sustaining loop of concept motive concept is enough to fool the scanners
5975079 that would invalidate the protection it gives youve got to pick your own images otherwise a metapattern emerges

5975097 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
5975098 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
5975099 howard is a right end theres no question about it
5975100 but we are going to work him in a little bit at left because hes a good pass rusher
5975101 mcdougle is pushing hes got two more preseason games so well know more then
5975102 this has become one of those situations where theres competition between mcdougle and chris clemons
5975103 we have to get chris back on the field until we get him back on the field were just not going to know
5975104 i just want to stay focused on staying on the field
5975105 thats been the biggest thing in my whole career the injuries
5975106 as long as i stay on the field and play up to my potential everything else is going to fall into place im not there yet i just want to keep improving
5975107 it sets you back a lot when you cant go out and compete and be at the top of your game stay in shape and practice
5975108 we need as many healthy players as we can get right now
5975109 when ive been out there its been going well ive been able to pick up the defense ive been able to go out and show some of the things im capable of doing show some of the reasons they brought me in here its unfortunate the injury has come at a critical time
5975110 i think its just hey the best players are going to play
5975111 i can say i think hes come a long way
5975112 we stay in the olympic family under these humiliating terms only because we value the precious international recognition through sports something we can never think of in power play diplomacy
5975113 i think it is a great pity that baseball has been dropped from the olympic games
5975114 it was a great promotion for us as long as we were playing baseball in the olympics countries paid attention to us
5975115 everywhere we go we speak the same language and see familiar faces
5975116 his pommel horse routine that might have been more exciting to me than what i just did
5975117 my routine tonight kind of caps off the olympic games for the united states
5975118 both the mens and the womens programs are committed to remaining on the podium
5975119 i figured if i dont gamble im not going to medal if i do gamble and fall im not going to medal if i happen to stay on im going to medal
5975120 i dont want to say im a showoff but i kind of like it when people watch
5975121 i love this flavor its like three snacks in one
5975122 this strong performance should be put in the context of a challenging international environment
5975123 the imported inflation is mainly attributed to oil and food prices particularly cereals cooking oil fish and sugar
5975124 its the first time for several years that imported inflation has been so significant in rwanda
5975125 dont compare the us market for mobile vas to the indian market
5975126 the us market is built on a 3 ringtone while the indian market is built on a rs 7 ringtone when you are told in the us that youve got a 100 000 ringtone downloads you are paid for a 100 000 ringtone downloads after 1 month in india if you have 700 000 ringtone downloads youre told youve got 100 000 and you get paid for 30 000 one year after its done
5975127 if you have ever dealt with mobile operator you will know that after your meeting ends with one operator every mobile operator knows what youre talking about
5975128 in telecom operators have actively discouraged free content if you put your content up for free the amount of money i make off advertising on a per click basis is equal to the money i make the revenue share i get out of a rs 3 sms it is actually encouraging me to destroy existing business models so if a big media company suddenly decides that its easier to give the content away for free because it is easier to collect rs 1 lakh from an advertiser than revenue share from an operator the whole game starts changing
5975129 dont compare the us market for vas to the indian market
5975130 a relative who lives in el cerrito grew then in her backyard and didnt know what to do with them
5975131 some people really like it they ask for it some people really dont like it
5975132 and things just werent clicking with golden just simple things i dont know i didnt like his approach how he came at me stuff like that
5975133 ive been in philly all my life i just wanted to experience something new i think i needed a change it was time
5975134 technically robinson is still enrolled in classes for the fall semester
5975135 ive already had a lot of calls the last couple of weeks from other division i programs
5975136 im looking at schools back east i dont want to be too far from my mom
5975137 it was just something in my heart that i felt i had to do
5975138 i started thinking about leaving back in january but i stuck with it its hard to leave but i dont have any hard feelings towards anyone i talked to golden he was real frustrated about the situation
5975139 when leo was in high school he was a linebacker after we recruited him he never played above 250 or 255 pounds but he was quick as a cat
5975140 but theyre the same kind of people excellent students very prideful to do well no matter what challenge you give them they take it on i think stefens going to be an outstanding offensive lineman
5975141 i had a chance to get in there and feel comfortable going into this year i feel like i know my way around i think i know what to expect
5975142 i like to do a lot of extra stuff after we run after we lift
5975143 but stefen does extra on top of extra thats something that really sets him apart his work ethic is phenomenal he has that drive and desire to be great
5975144 leo never quite got the credit he should have gotten because we had a lot of other good kids when he was here like sean farrell and mike munchak who were no 1 draft picks
5975145 but when we played southern cal in the 1982 fiesta bowl they had two or three kids bruce matthews and a couple of other guys who ended up being all pros they havent blocked leo yet leo made more plays that day than you could shake a stick at and was voted the games outstanding defensive player after the lions 26 10 victory
5975146 i wanted to look around and make sure i was going to the place where id best fit in i liked boston college a lot but their coaches left right when i was being recruited so that made it easy i think i would have come here anyway
5975147 i mean whats not to like its a positive that my dad and my uncle were here i walk by their pictures on the wall every day and it makes me smile
5975148 fest steht dass apl heute nicht existieren w rde h tte nol sie nicht gekauft
5975149 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5975150 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5975151 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
5975152 you never really want to leave your team and your teammates and all that but its nice to be back in a pennant race
5975153 it was fun playing in san diego and i loved it there but im looking forward to the last month and a half here it was great last time i was here it was fun and it was exciting i had a lot of good memories then and i look forward to making some new ones
5975154 for me its kind of like the first day of spring training all over again i just want to learn my teammates and do what i can to be accepted get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them hopefully well get to the postseason and find out if its a better team than 2 years ago its how you do in october that determines how good the team is
5975155 the hardest thing is to make the chase because once you get there the pressures off
5975156 missing the chase would be hard to swallow but were not going to swallow it because were going to make the chase
5975157 if you had asked me before the season if it wouldve been a distraction i wouldve said no but i was proven wrong

5975166 a womans place is in the kitchen the evolution of women chefs
5975167 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
5975168 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
5975169 this maybe will stop some of the whining going on
5975170 i just didnt want to get into these daily progress reports ive done nothing but rehab i guess were sort of in the rumor mill now i dont wear a knee brace i wore this wrap today really for the first time
5975171 if were to the point of someone putting a cell phone picture on the news thats a little disappointing so i guess ill squash that right now its not true i dont wear a knee brace
5975172 i dont know if any of those injured guys will be out there on sept 7 but my guess is they will be
5975173 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
5975174 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
5975175 the world is a mosaic of visions and each vision is encapsulated by a language every time a language is lost one vision of the world disappears
5975176 unable to continue our partnership with the school district of philadelphia
5975177 were just going through a very detailed process reevaluating how we provide resources and services
5975178 we dont have all the candidates wed like to have for music
5975179 with the whole community commitment to put art and music back into every school this feels very much at risk
5975180 its saying that the general assembly can specify or limit what money can be spent on so were glad the court agreed with our interpretation
5975181 a budget is always a compromise a package of not only allocations of money but a statement of policy priorities regarding expenditures of those moneys
5975182 it is important that the monies be spent for the purposes for which the general assembly approved them
5975183 the americans had been putting pressure on islamabad since february for him to get its act together against the taliban and al qaeda and pakistans foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi and pakistans ambassador to washington husain haqqani always told washington that the government could not move forward independently because of musharraf
5975184 hence musharraf was politely told by washington through various channels to gracefully resign but he remained defiant and ultimately washington pulled its support of him and the ruling coalition moved for his impeachment which forced him to resign
5975185 com mhas dit que es deien aquests sonen molt b
5975186 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5975187 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5975188 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5975189 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5975190 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5975191 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5975192 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5975193 yeah ill face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been
5975194 they have both been repeatedly subjected to humiliating questioning searches and detention for hours when they attempt to fly or cross the border
5975195 we are currently reviewing the complaint and will respond appropriately for both national security and personal privacy reasons the terrorist screening center does not confirm or deny the existence of any names in the terrorist screening database
5975196 while pheaas mission remains beyond reproach the agency has lost its focus
5975197 many of pheaas leaders seem to have put their self interest ahead of the needs of pennsylvania students
5975198 he certainly would be supportive of anything that would help pheaa maintain or improve its mission
5975199 there was no pattern to it which made him hard to catch
5975200 we put a dragnet out for this guy and he walked into it
5975201 when he was picked up he told us he had found an open door and he was going to come back in an hour
5975202 the quicker you get to them the better off theyre going to be
5975203 but i cant answer whether it would have been a better outcome
5975204 if you go into cardiac arrest and do not receive defibrillation within three or four minutes then the chance of you being converted starts getting less and less
5975205 i have great confidence in both individuals to carry out this agenda and meet the challenges ive outlined
5975206 has called the integrity of members into question on many occasions and acted as a pr firm for the administration
5975207 the best way to achieve cost efficient reductions is to put markets to work to that end rather than the regulatory approach said biden
5975208 therefore obtaining a replacement is an extremely difficult and to date impossible task
5975209 clearly anyone can understand that it would also make mr lee a persona non grata among his fellow military personnel even if such a reaction would be unwarranted
5975210 probably just looking for the celebrity with the biggest ass
5975211 cracked sidewalks decrepit classrooms structural blight megatons of gray concrete and a giant looming smokestack will leave you wondering what brutalist fiend slapped together this sorry excuse for a campus
5975212 the information you are prepared to validate through publication is years if not a decade out of date
5975213 if you visit our campus you can quickly see for yourself the report is false
5975214 a significant investment in campus security to ensure the safety of students faculty staff and visitors
5975215 spreading demonstrably false reports under the guise of calling it gossip is something we hope the daily news will not assist more than that radar is not a magazine deserving of the daily news attention
5975216 no one understands what its like to live with a chronic condition
5975217 theyre excited high energy and fun to play to so its cool but i do feel my music can be brought to a wider audience and im excited to see if the movie will change that
5975218 the music in the film is harder rocking than the stuff ive done in the past i didnt write any of it but its more like the originals im now doing
5975219 plus im older almost 20 closer to the age of your average singer songwriter
5975220 all the posters advertising it on the new york city buses listed the wrong day and time
5975221 to look down the coast and not see anything its amazing
5975222 this set was built exactly 20 minutes before i walked on to it to shoot
5975223 they were nailing the floorboards down and i came in and the beds themselves the inside was all stone theyd discussed slate which i thought they meant was a color it was not supposed to be a coffin and i freaked out
5975224 they are supposed to feel a little bit like coffins but when they were stone they felt like not just dracula but like louis jourdan
5975225 isnt going to be buried like the pilot of firefly
5975226 a completely organic experience from the lunch i had with eliza which is something ive done a few times with her to going home and my wife saying yeah it sounds like the next thing just because you can tell
5975227 a week after eliza and i had lunch i went in
5975228 we are kind of living in a fish bowl a little bit
5975229 sometimes i dont like people to see the man behind the curtain i dont like them to know that something wasnt awesome before they saw it
5975230 you know the things we had to tweak the things we had to cut that is inevitable
5975231 but now i dont think it is just us the whole world is so much about seeing behind the curtain and seeing how things are made and how they work and the extended cut and what we could have done and what we didnt do and the alternate ending and you just you kind of take it as part and parcel at the beginning
5975232 frankly this is beginning to look like its based mostly on myth not data
5975233 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
5975234 thats absurd and it basically says lets not talk about it
5975235 what this movement calls for is a national discussion it doesnt recommend a policy
5975236 students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5975237 if kids are able to handle themselves responsibly then why not
5975238 i know all over the world it is like 18 some places 16 in canada its 19 i always thought 21 was a weird number at 18 youre old enough to join the army and die but you cant drink a beer
5975239 itll keep kids out of trouble i think college kids are responsible enough to take care of themselves
5975240 they shouldnt be able to drink if theyre seniors in high school if i was allowed to drink when i was 18 i definitely would have gotten drunk every day after high school it would have been bad news
5975241 it would be much better to say youre 18 now
5975242 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
5975243 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5975244 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5975245 within three months of launching mi has secured nationwide deals with leading distributors fonexpress nakumatt in kenya melcom in ghana cell 2 cell in uganda mauritel in mauritius and madagascar additional deals in nigeria and burkina faso have also been tied up

5975247 everybody was moving very slowly and there were great opportunities for him to play overseas for a lot of money fenerbahce are turkish champions and a euroleague team it was a tough decision and it came down to fenerbache and triumph in russia
5975248 there are still a couple of preseason games left and time before the season opener
5975249 i think there are some other teams that are looking for tight ends and maybe there is a better opportunity for him somewhere else
5975250 we felt like in fairness to him and out of respect for marcus and what he has done in his career hes had an outstanding career coming from a small school and has become a very productive player he deserved that
5975251 all the players that are here we are comfortable with to some degree
5975252 on the other hand there is always room for improvement with everyone i think with marcus that it wasnt really going to work out here the way that we had hoped and he had hoped
5975253 with toms situation i would say everything he would probably be doing hes done before
5975254 it is just a question of fine tuning it working on timing and all those kinds of things
5975255 these are the same kinds of conversations we had last year when randy moss wasnt out there so i think that works to his advantage some of the practices that he hasnt participated in are still things that he has done before not new things
5975256 when guys are in the training room and theyre not out here practicing youve to be willing to release them and live with it and pick other people up for more competition
5975257 we havent done anything as of today on that but i think thats kind of a dead issue
5975258 you know i said what i said and the situation is what it is so to keep dwelling on it isnt going to do us any good
5975259 i can definitely see gabby and ashley breaking into the england side this season they can be as good as they want
5975260 they have great potential they have everything in front of them they are both young with fantastic skills and they can both succeed and go a long way in the game
5975261 it is the start of a new era for england and there is a good generation of players coming through i think they will be very strong in the years to come and gabby and ashley can be part of that
5975262 the good thing is the players want to learn gabby has improved so much in just my time here since january 2007 and i am sure he will continue to get even better
5975263 he can be as good as he wants to be and there is definitely more to come from him i also think all the young players at villa will reap the benefits of playing in europe this season

5975280 i mean whats not to like its a positive that my dad and my uncle were here i walk by their pictures on the wall every day and it makes me smile
5975281 i just wanted to stay close enough so in the last 600 or 1 000 meters i could make a move it was a tactical race and not a speed race and i always feel more comfortable being in the top three or four in a tactical race
5975282 its been a little tight ever since ive been over here
5975283 it tightened up with about 350 meters to go and from there i just wanted to hang on ill get some treatment on it and rest up until friday
5975284 it wasnt fun i wasnt getting that runners high but im in the finals and thats all that matters

5975296 de medaillespiegel is de spiegel van onze eigen ziel geworden no time for losers neem de softbalsters tot zwarte schapen uitgeroepen door de vaderlandse pers ook door een columnist van deze krant omdat ze na afloop van hun verloren toernooi het lef hadden om te roepen dat ze ook veel lol hadden gehad in china bij hun verbale executie werd gemakshalve even vergeten dat de dames al bij voorbaat kansloos waren in dit toernooi maar dan nog het ergste is dat wij nederlanders bezig zijn de olympische gedachte te verkwanselen vroeger beschimpten we amerikanen oostblokkers en duitsers omdat die duidelijk maakten alleen naar de spelen te komen om te winnen nu doen we net zo hard mee

5975298 it is a place completely independent regardless of whether a un resolution says that exists or not it is independent kosovo has been recognized by two thirds of the eu sates europe japan and australia it is as an independent country i feel sorry that russia has chosen to make this thing more difficult rather than to ease it risking the stability but also the european future of serbia
5975299 united states policy in the balkans has been dysfunctional since march 1992 when their ambassador warren zimmerman persuaded izetbegovic the islamist leader of the bosnian muslims to withdraw his signature to the lisbon agreement this decision which led to us acceptance of the results of an illegal referendum and recognition of the first muslim state in europe triggered civil war in bosnia and led directly to the death and destruction that followed in the following years us decisions have proven to be equally disastrous for the region the decision of the united states government to support the cause of the terrorist kla in its armed rebellion to secede from yugoslavia is another example of us policy making gone wrong their current policy supporting independence for kosovo is but another chapter in an unfolding series of strategic errors united states policy in the balkans has been characterized by cynicism duplicity and short term tactical gain by backing islamist aims in the region and supporting terrorist groups in kosovo there might be the immediate advantage of establishing a large military base in kosovo or appeasing further albanian demands by advocating independence for kosovo but in the long term it will backfire
5975300 youth workers pour themselves into the lives of the kids they work with year round offering them guidance support and a listening ear as they learn to walk and grow with christ
5975301 youth worker appreciation day is all about recognizing their selfless efforts and their genuine hearts for impacting the lives of kids
5975302 it did hit home a little for the all around
5975303 honestly i go by everything happens for a reason for some reason the judges werent giving me the normal scores that im used to but they had a reason for it if they saw something we didnt i respect that i was meant to have the silver
5975304 i was proud that she finally got a gold medal now we can both say that were olympic champions that will be really cool
5975305 i competed a full meet about five times the only gymnast on my team to do that i feel ive given everything i have physically and mentally its just the end of the road its normal to feel a little down on the last day because youve given everything and you dont have much left in you
5975306 i was making uncharacteristic mistakes that i havent made in a long time
5975307 i think he was getting nervous just like i was
5975308 i was doing routine after routine without hitting them the way i did in previous competitions he was getting serious he told me to stop and take a second and gather myself
5975309 i felt nervous for myself but i didnt really care how the scores came up and how the placements finished i just wanted to give the best routine i could i didnt want to leave the olympics feeling like i could have done better or i could have ended better i wanted to finish it off as best i could i think i did
5975310 ive only had a couple of people say boo back to me
5975311 it still hurts a little that he used the word front runners book said had evolved into what he said was a sincere attempt to get fans at the ballpark to be more positive
5975312 you had some cheers you had some boos i guess
5975313 thats what i said it was pretty much going to be again like i said if we get the win theyll be cheering
5975314 i was speaking for a lot of guys i wasnt just speaking for ryan ryans had his share ive had my share pat burrell has had his share i think chase utley hasnt been touched and hopefully it remains that way
5975315 a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
5975316 but it could have been worse in my opinion i saw people standing up for j roll i heard some claps even though its pretty hard to hear way up here
5975317 im glad i did it im still hoping it catches on some more i mean who knows
5975318 it really calmed me down it made me think you can give any little extra energy any piece of yourself you have left you dont have to save anything johnson said
5975319 going into that last routine i didnt care what score i got i just wanted to hit the best routine i could to finish off my experience and not have any regrets
5975320 i didnt want to leave here thinking i could have done better finishing off that routine knowing i hit the best routine i could at the time it felt amazing

5975351 we stay in the olympic family under these humiliating terms only because we value the precious international recognition through sports something we can never think of in power play diplomacy

5975356 i always thought it would be great for all the very talented engineers in the asia pacific region to start growing open source companies
5975357 we didnt have a lot of support we relied on a few computers and free bandwidth we didnt have sales or marketing staff
5975358 to start an open source company you just need to be good at what you do and do good stuff keep costs down it is possible to start extremely small

5975360 is equal to or exceeds many first generation emerging markets
5975361 the criteria for an emerging market set out here growth private sector led growth and investible markets can be identified in eight sub saharan african countries botswana ghana kenya mozambique nigeria tanzania uganda and zambia
5975362 emerging markets are attractive to investors because they offer rates of return that are high relative to mature markets and offer opportunities for investors to diversify risk
5975363 growth prospects in emerging market countries are likely to be based on technological catch up significant output gaps young populations and faster population growth than in mature markets the processes that bring about growth may differ by country but a track record of solid growth is common to emerging markets the potential for risk diversification might arise at the country level when growth trends are not synchronised with mature market economies
5975364 i see fewer commercial cds these days again due to the greater popularity of the ipod and similar hardware players the commercial audio cd may not exactly be doomed but it is certainly under fire from the new media player technologies i dont see much use of the dvd as a sharing format the ipod strikes again but i have seen some excellent video productions on dvd from a few students i expect to do more with the format as both storage and playback medium but i doubt that it will gain significant ground against the portable players

5975412 retail on site digital solutions are the next big thing in imaging and todays technology is bringing down the barriers to entry not since the introduction of the first digital mini lab has there been a product that will excite retailers like the hp digital range and were anticipating a lot of enthusiasm hps solutions are easy to use take up little space are energy efficient and contain no hazardous chemicals retailers who previously considered photo processing too difficult should look at this offering
5975413 hp has developed these products to work together as a system and retailers will see the benefit in terms of improved workflows that cut down production turnaround time the quality from these printers is exceptional with true photo quality and excellent fade resistance hp is at the forefront of digital imaging and we know with hp well be selling the best not just now but in the future too
5975414 almost everyone i know who saw it considers it to be by far the best film they saw at sundance
5975415 guys understand that for the betterment of the game weve got to keep our feelings intact but once you pull on the australian jumper and see the ball you just never know whats going to happen
5975416 thats our game and not part of theirs so its just a sense of pulling yourself back at times but when the balls there in your area as competitive as all of us guys are usually we just go 100 per cent and you just see what happens
5975417 we are proud to be selected by boeing to supply key elements for the f15 this contract win reflects the trust and recognition we have established among major aviation manufacturers such as boeing
5975418 a coding issue which is beyond our scope of support
5975419 it didnt happen i was on the ground on saturday and sunday and it didnt happen there was no co ordination with any of the other agencies without public representatives there would have been no co ordination
5975420 as soon as i got to lisburn i phoned the emergency services to alert them but there was no answer from anyone but the police and they said it was responsibility of the roads service i thought that should have been a priority because of the possibility of the loss of life
5975421 this is the third flooding difficulty we have had in three years this isnt the first i would look over it if it was the first and we were learning but i mean we have had three of these
5975422 i will be appointing a firm of independent consultants to carry out an investigation on our behalf
5975423 these will be consultants who have not been involved in any way with the work to date on the underpass contract
5975424 and the sorts of things i want them to look at will be the whole background intensity of the rainfall to establish clearly the cause of the flooding to look at the design and to look at the construction standards
5975425 people were allowed to drive into that situation right up until the water was two metres high and nobody stopped them something went seriously wrong
5975426 the warnings got firmed up and got more horrific as time went on
5975427 we want assurances that these gates are inspected at least once a week we also believe the culverting of the blackstaff river along the monarch section of the westlink contributed to the serious flooding of the broadway roundabout
5975428 i routinely go round and see the amount of debris that accumulates it doesnt take too long to build up plastic bottles bags all kinds of things there is a mattress there and a settee was pulled out today its unbelievable the amount of stuff that is there
5975429 because the river is not open it doesnt go away naturally what would have happened if at the same time as the flooding at broadway that gate at glenmachan had been blocked
5975430 theres a whole stretch of unculverted river along the boucher road and there is no flooding there that takes all the extra water and then it goes into the culverted section and it increases in speed and force all that water goes into the one locality and that is what is causing the problems
5975431 a certain number of individuals have been badly hurt by the flooding
5975432 we cant put a value on the damage at the minute we dont know exactly how many hundreds of acres of crops are underwater but the number of livestock killed is running into a couple of hundred at least
5975433 farmers are shell shocked at the amount of damage causing by moving water the common comment ive been hearing is that no one has ever seen a flood like it except maybe once in the last 40 years or so and even then it was in the middle of winter
5975434 the force of the water and its speed created a lot of damage to fields it took soil plants and potatoes with it and some farmers even found fish in drills afterwards it was surreal
5975435 farmers have asked about compensation and thats something were going to be looking into immediately
5975436 this flooding will cause genuine hardship for farmers who have lost crops or livestock and affect key farm projects such as the need to finish building slurry tanks by the end of year deadline
5975437 we dont know what we are going to do we have lost everything ellen has been sweeping and trying to clean up the house but we feel so helpless we dont know where we are
5975438 we were in the process of changing our insurance company so we wont get any money back for damage to the house contents and the car is probably a write off
5975439 i was in england staying with one of our sons so ellen was alone in the house
5975440 she had gone to bed and woke up when she heard noises she heard shouts from next door and went to the bathroom window to find out what was going on when she realised she couldnt get downstairs people were being taken out of the estate in boats but she was stuck in the house from about 3 45am until after 7am when our son alan climbed in the window to help she then had to wade through brown stinking water that was up to her chest to get out
5975441 everything was destroyed all our papers are gone all the clothes in the hotpress were ruined all the furniture was floating around in the water the kitchen appliances and work surfaces were all destroyed and the wooden floorboards have all sprung its a disaster
5975442 we have been staying in a hotel while we wait for the housing executive to rehouse us but weve been told were only entitled to a one bedroom flat despite explaining that two of our sons are at university and have no income
5975443 mark 29 a mature student is due home from strathclyde university today and we have nowhere for him to stay the housing executive has said he is an adult and therefore not a dependant but we pay for his accommodation when he is at university we dont know what we are going to do
5975444 when you look at the scale of damage in peoples houses i accept that 1 000 is a small amount of money
5975445 its not meant to be an alternative to insurance its really designed to help people get back on their feet and to bring some semblance of normality to houses

5975459 because it was decided by the electorate i dont think we have the moral right to decide

5975524 some studies have suggested that age bias may still exist in trauma care even in the prehospital phase of that care
5975525 consistently less likely to consider transporting elderly patients to a trauma center
5975526 it may be helpful to highlight the literature that now suggests that elderly trauma patients do in fact return to productive lives after their injury which can eliminate the perception of futility of care that may be used consciously or subconsciously to justify age bias

5975558 daarom stelde de monnikengemeenschap van de trappistenabdij van westmalle de productiebeperking die al jaren geldt opnieuw in vraag er werd echter beslist de beperking te handhaven
5975559 als we meer zouden willen brouwen zou de brouwinstallatie grondig aangepast en uitgebreid moeten worden ten tweede hechten de monniken heel veel belang aan een beperkte productie op mensenmaat
5975560 we zouden ook een extra ploeg kunnen inzetten of overwerk toestaan maar daar zijn we niet voor we vinden het belangrijk dat onze lekenmedewerkers op een redelijk uur naar huis kunnen gaan zodat er tijd rest voor hun familiale en sociale leven we willen ook het persoonlijke contact behouden met die mensen en dat is bij een schaalvergroting misschien niet meer mogelijk

5975563 according to this evenings information a supply ship will arrive tomorrow and on the 21st a second boat will come
5975564 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5975565 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5975566 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5975567 i am certain that such a scenario is not possible in ukraine
5975568 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighbouring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
5975569 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilisation scenario in crimea
5975570 i have therefore sent an urgent proposal to the president of russia to start talks on signing an agreement that would regulate our relations in the event of military action like that which we saw at the beginning of august
5975571 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship
5975572 but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5975573 if these decisions are in fact taken on behalf of the georgian aggressor we will not be able to maintain the quality and the schedule of our relationship with nato
5975574 we have a serious temptation to bring all our potential cooperation with nato under question

5975579 that may cause us to keep a more frugal ship
5975580 if we wait until january all these issues would have been competing with everything else in january
5975581 once we get them out of the way now then we can address other issues in january that wont be conflicting or competing issues
5975582 the only thing that wasnt addressed was the tax holiday he got 80 percent 90 percent so thats not too shabby

5975586 homeowners are catching it from all angles not only with higher mortgage rates but increasing fuel food and energy costs
5975587 it s unsurprising that they are demonstrating a siege mentality
5975588 open plan eh guess itll be like a slumber party every night
5975589 why not you know you will be all alone if we dont were the closest friends you have the people who know you the best what will you do without us
5975590 are you sure new friends arent very reliable you know what if it doesnt work out how do you know you can trust her
5975591 life is uncertain things could fall apart at any moment
5975592 but confidence lives next door now and is there when i need her without crowding me
5975593 you know ive met them and theyre pretty demanding theres never any rest and theyre always asking for you to keep reaching what if you cant reach as far as they think you can what if you fall will they really catch you
5975594 hell she could carry us all she has the most amazing pipes
5975595 whatever you know you cant get by without us the world is dark and you are alone here right now i dont see these so called new friends around why dont we just hang out until they come over and then we can all hang out together
5975596 he looks pretty good hes an excellent player i have noticed no rust

5975598 im not exactly where i would normally be at this point in camp
5975599 i would normally be in better football shape theres no type of running in the world that you can possibly do to match with football i trained with a 20 pound vest this offseason still once you put the pads on and everything else its different its a lot different

5975611 this program would not be appropriate for violent students this is not a program for students who are assaultive or aggressive
5975612 originally it was all about substance abuse so it seems like its a contradiction with the original plan
5975613 we want to be helpful and supportive but i am trying to find out more information about that piece of the program because i have concerns how would the schools know that those kids have that diagnosis is that going to become a policy of tulsa public schools to identify those kids with mental health issues and separate them
5975614 all those are different ways that we come to realize that a student has a mental health issue
5975615 not all will be sent there to new vision it only means those students are eligible to be considered for enrollment in the program
5975616 from my understanding from taylor young we found out where our needs were from those community mental health agencies and this program was designed based on that
5975617 im sure that it will be fine tuned and theres going to be very strong oversight i trust the professionalism of the community mental health groups that made the recommendations to us that we needed to have a program put in place so those kids are not put out of school on home bound services
5975618 we kids made such a fuss over the dessert that my mother got the recipe from the cafe owners
5975619 there were no 18 wheelers just big trucks and the drivers knew where good food was to be had

5975635 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5975636 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5975637 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5975638 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5975639 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5975640 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5975641 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5975642 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5975643 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5975644 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5975645 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

5975668 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5975669 jammer maar het hoort bij de sport zei de wilde die vijf weken voor de spelen bij een val tijdens de training een hersenschudding had opgelopen
5975670 dat heeft me drie weken gekost ik weet niet of dat vandaag meespeelde ik maakte gewoon fouten
5975671 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5975672 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5975673 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5975674 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5975675 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5975676 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5975677 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5975678 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5975679 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5975680 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5975681 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5975682 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5975683 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5975684 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5975685 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5975686 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5975687 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5975688 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5975689 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5975690 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5975691 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5975692 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5975693 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5975694 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5975695 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5975696 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5975697 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5975698 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5975699 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5975700 its a long time since ive seen brazil so stingy and defensive
5975701 i didnt think they could do any damage they never managed to play their way out of defence nobody helped ronaldinho and they never played coherently i think argentina were better in every metre of the field
5975702 other games organisers have used designated areas of the city for protests in the past
5975703 we were quite happy to hear that many of these issues were resolved once there was a solution they potential protesters were satisfied
5975704 everyone has the right to speak nobody says you do not have the right to speak
5975705 weve got to tighten up the amateur programme so that in four years we do a whole lot better
5975706 the problem is that these days its all about money when its all about money this happens the guys are just thinking about money theres a kind of manipulation where the kids are being told go and turn pro gold medals arent important
5975707 the managers dont want the guys winning golds because then they have to pay them more
5975708 back in the day amateur boxing was on tv every weekend in the states
5975709 when you have a good amateur programme it helps develop well rounded boxers look at the pro game now why do the championships change hands so quickly its because these guys dont know how to fight different styles
5975710 when youre a pro you avoid the fighters whose style doesnt suit your style it makes them weak amateur boxing is harder than pro you have to fight everybody in your draw
5975711 without a good amateur grounding its the same as missing elementary and middle school and high school its your education as a boxer
5975712 i want to continue to swim and hopefully be on the olympic team for a third time and id like to get a third gold that would be awesome
5975713 i doubt it whether she will compete because our trials for that are in april
5975714 i dont want to get back into the water too early
5975715 im going to take some time out of the pool and take some time to get mentally re charged and re energised
5975716 when i get back into training i want to be really focussed so that means taking a long break
5975717 ive always been under the mindset that its better to do fewer events and do them well than multiple events and do them mediocre ly sic
5975718 if other people want to try and do what hes done then more power to them
5975719 after the failure in athens we put all the critical media articles up on the walls of our gyms
5975720 our success this time can be attributed to our better understanding of the new rules and executing accordingly
5975721 theyre saying they improved the scoring system look at this that makes no sense
5975722 the code is in a permanent evolution various domains will be improved
5975723 we vacate this rule because it is contrary to the statutory directive that each permit must include adequate monitoring requirements
5975724 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5975725 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5975726 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5975727 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5975728 birimiz sakatlan nca geriye tek forvet kal yor tabii ki sezon uzun ve hakikaten bir forvete daha ihtiya var ancak al nacaksa iyi bir golc almam z gerekir e er iyi bir forvet bulabilirlerse bu transfer yap ls n biz rekabete her zaman haz r z
5975729 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5975730 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5975731 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5975732 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5975733 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5975734 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5975735 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5975736 who are open to doing something on the production side
5975737 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5975738 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5975739 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5975740 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5975741 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5975742 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5975743 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5975744 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5975745 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5975746 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5975747 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5975748 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5975749 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5975750 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5975751 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5975752 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5975753 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5975754 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5975757 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5975758 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5975759 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5975760 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5975761 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5975762 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5975763 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5975764 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5975765 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5975766 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5975767 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5975768 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5975769 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5975770 taxpayers are demanding better services so if youre picking on your employees i dont know how that combination is gonna play out very well
5975771 you know when you look at the constitution you look at the role of the government the role of the government is to provide essential services and basic services
5975772 clearly when you look at arts and things of that nature those are things that are nice that may help your community but theyre not essential services

5975782 the reject shop is well positioned for future growth underpinned by continued improvement in existing stores as well as a robust store rollout program
5975783 sales for the first few weeks of this year have been very pleasing and the new store openings have been to plan
5975784 this is a very pleasing result for the company in the face of general market uncertainty and the impact on consumer confidence caused by high interest rates and petrol prices particularly in the second half
5975785 this result reflects our continuing focus on retail fundamentals in offering our customers great value in the products we sell
5975786 with the potential to open 400 stores nationally we are now focused on the steps we need to take to ensure we have the capacity to continue to grow while maintaining a focus on the day to day needs of the business
5975787 the rally we have seen on equity markets has contributed to this

5975799 everyone seems to be piling back into the resource stocks which are up about 3 7 per cent
5975800 it has gained a little bit more than it lost yesterday when it was down 2 7 per cent
5975801 theres an appetite out there to invest somewhere but no one is sure where to invest
5975802 local financial stocks were down in early trade but started to rally towards the end of the day
5975803 colorado and the west are both a big focus of this campaign
5975804 that investment and the energy that we see on the ground in new mexico will absolutely translate in november
5975805 in a place like montana there simply werent the resources to keep a party headquarters opened during the entire year in non election years and so it was very difficult

5975856 the figures uncovered by the survey are a definite cause for concern and could be blamed partly on the msc legislation introduced last year
5975857 despite the huge legislative shifts the contracting industry has experienced in recent times the ir35 legislation remains key for self employed contractors in determining employment status
5975858 the recent dragonfly hearing at the high court as well as hmrcs announcement that it is to crack down on expenses dispensations offered by some umbrella organisations clearly demonstrate that the treasury and hmrc are keeping a close eye on our industry and will crack down on non compliant businesses and contractors
5975859 our survey also found that around 10 per cent of uk contractors are turning to more traditional high street accountants to check their ir35 status and we would also advise caution for this approach too
5975860 this area of law is constantly shifting and we would argue that the time and cost commitment required to maintain the level of specialism required in this area is perhaps beyond many high street accountants
5975861 brookson worked closely with hmrc to agree our ir35 processes and procedures and ensure the compliance of our contractors and we work in partnership with our legal team at dwf llp solicitors to verify the compliance of all our contractors we would urge all contractors to ensure they have obtained robust and documented professional advice for each of their assignments or risk a hefty tax bill
5975862 i want to make sure that in the lead up to the next state election that we actually stamp our style on what we are going to present to the people of queensland versus the style of this government in queensland

5975870 to my knowledge most research in young adults has used a standard of up to six sex partners when examining risk

5975876 la voz de aztlan has learned that the israeli embassy used heavy handed measures to have the two israelis released very high level emergency meetings took place between mexican secretary of foreign relations jorge gutman general macedo de la concha and a top ariel sharon envoy who flew to mexico city specially for that purpose el as luf of the israeli embassy worked night and day and their official spokeswoman hila engelhart went into high gear after many hours of complete silence what went on during those high level meetings no one knows but many in mexico are in disbelief at their release
5975877 palestinian security forces have arrested a group of palestinians for collaborating with israel and posing as operatives of osama bin ladens al qaeda terrorist network a senior official said yesterday the arrests come two days after israeli prime minister ariel sharon charged al qaeda militants were operating in gaza and in lebanon it was considered a surprise because the gaza strip is virtually sealed off by israeli troops the hardline israeli leader also charged other members of the terror group were cooperating with lebanons shiite militia hizbollah

5975883 well that was just a serendipitous thirty six thats a pattern
5975884 investigators within the dea ins and fbi have all told fox news that to pursue or even suggest israeli spying is considered
5975885 are you suggesting that you are convinced that there was a state sponsor behind 9 11
5975886 i think there is very compelling evidence that at least some of the terrorists were assisted not just in financing although that was part of it by a sovereign foreign government and that we have been derelict in our duty to track that down make the further case or find the evidence that would indicate that that is not true and we can look for other reasons why the terrorists were able to function so effectively in the united states
5975887 do you think that will ever become public which countries youre talking about
5975888 it will become public at some point when its turned over to the archives but thats 20 or 30 years from now
5975889 the tyre brand scorecard outlines that consumers are highly active in sharing feedback on tyres in an online social community the most active responses are from those either very happy or very unhappy with their tyre purchases and this mirrors peoples loyalty patterns increasingly people are prepared to shift brands based on what other consumers are sharing in online communities
5975890 an interesting outcome of the report details that while consumers are on the whole are happy with their current tyres they dont necessarily choose the same brand when replacing them consumers typically have been more aware of tyre brands but courtesy of internet based research and independent information are now able to identify specific details about tread patterns and why certain tread patterns are more suitable for tyre retailers this means that there is more opportunity to integrate internet based marketing information with appropriate point of sale information
5975891 the internet is growing in its popularity in educating consumers and subsequently people are seeking better information from tyre manufacturers when it matters most at point of sale traditional advertising needs to be combined with marketing that focuses on product differentiation general tyre education and safety programs with retail environments that improve the sales experience for that particular brand tyre manufacturers that now cater for both female and male purchasing habits in the new online space and traditional retail channel are going to benefit the most the game certainly has changed

5975930 dat is inderdaad vreemd maar er is wel een aanleiding om te beginnen is de muziek oorspronkelijk geschreven voor een symfonieorkest in het begin heeft weill immers vooral symfonische werken geschreven min of meer in de stijl van sch nberg zijn schitterend vioolconcerto b v daarna is hij daar met de driestuiversopera e d wat van afgeweken maar voor dit stuk heeft hij weer daarnaar gegrepen hij vindt dan ook dat je daar niet aan mag raken je mag het m a w niet bewerken naar een kleiner ensemble eigenlijk is dat normaal want het was juist zijn opzet om nog eens iets voor symfonieorkest te schrijven en niet voor kleinere bezettingen zoals bij de driestuiversopera bovendien wil ik daar ook niet aankomen want het is heel duidelijk voor symfonieorkest geschreven en als men dat zou arrangeren voor een kleiner orkest dat is een beetje oneervol daarom hadden we zelf al beslist om bepaalde stukken weg te laten i p v te bewerken en te vervangen door heel nieuwe muziek maar toen hoorden we dus dat we sowieso niks mochten bewerken en aangezien wij toen reeds middenin dat stuk zaten hebben we dan beslist gewoon lles te veranderen maar met alle respect voor kurt weill het is dus niet zo dat wij die muziek niet goed vinden integendeel ook wij waren vanuit de muziek vertrokken we vinden ze fantastisch mooi maar ons budget is gewoon te klein om daar een symfonieorkest tegenaan te gooien bovendien is zon orkest wel heel log terwijl wij de muzikanten voor en naast de dansers willen zetten het zou wel de eerste keer geweest zijn dat ik bij lod muziek van iemand anders zou hebben gespeeld
5975931 omdat het gewoon heel boeiend is van eens muziek van iemand anders te spelen en ook het geheel is knap de tekst is heel summier het is geen po tische tekst het is meer informatie je moet er wel inkomen je moet hem een paar keer gelezen hebben
5975932 maar dat is toch met alles zo je kan alleen maar hopen dat het klikt
5975933 maar de tekst was natuurlijk in oorsprong reeds bedoeld niet als literatuur maar als libretto voor een dansstuk hij is dus bedoeld om gestalte te geven niet om op papier te worden gelezen
5975934 is er niks an juist als je hem hoort zingen daarentegen de meeste operateksten stellen ook niks voor de tekst is gewoon een leidraad om iets over te brengen en of dat dan in het duits engels frans of vlaams is maakt niet zoveel uit als je schubert liederen voor het eerst hoort versta je dr ook niks van als je de tekst er niet bij hebt wat krijg je dan in een zaal waar die liederen worden gezongen hoor je op een bepaald moment die hele zaal een bladzijde omslaan maar dan ben je niet echt met die muziek bezig dan zit je gewoon die tekst te volgen
5975935 waarschijnlijk daar is geen duidelijkheid in brecht vond het origineel zelf ook niet goed en heeft het als dusdanig ook niet in zijn verzameld werk opgenomen hij gebruikte b v veel scheldwoorden waarvan er nog een aantal zijn blijven staan maar men mag aannemen dat het grootste deel ervan gekuist werd
5975936 alhoewel ik het eens ben met de psychologische interpretatie i p v de politieke heb ik daar zelf toch niet zo over nagedacht ik stel gewoon vast dat ik akoestische muziek probeer te brengen en geen elektronische dat is niet principieel want ik hou wel van synthesizers of van jimi hendrix of zo maar z lf lukt het niet ik heb het wel geprobeerd maar het is mijn medium niet anderzijds is het wel moeilijk om mijn muziek te defini ren het is geen kamermuziek of geen jazz maar wat is het dan wel
5975937 nee dat ligt veel te gevoelig als ik in die stijl zou gaan zitten dan zou het er wel de schijn van hebben dat ik denk het even beter te gaan doen en dat is dus helemaal niet zo op een bepaald moment hebben we de keuze gemaakt heel nieuwe muziek te brengen moderner dus op de uiterste grens van de tonaliteit
5975938 in grote lijnen wel het is ook geen ge mproviseerde muziek ze is helemaal uitgeschreven maar het is geen voor de hand liggende muziek omdat ik zelf van tal van andere muzieksoorten hou waarvan ik automatisch invloeden opdoe
5975939 zeker niet van oorsprong is het trouwens een duits instrument maar natuurlijk heb ik de bandoneon leren kennen in het tango orkestje waar ik gitaar speelde ik speel er echter geen tango op dat kan ik niet eens bij waso speel ik er jazz op of mijn eigen muziek dus want ik zie het meer als een draagbaar orgel een harmonium met een heel warme baskant die heel makkelijk mengt te vergelijken met een altviool als je een altviool samen met een hobo laat spelen b v hoor je maar n klank en de andere kant snijdt overal doorheen het is een instrument dat uitermate geschikt is voor kamermuziek anderzijds heb ik daarnaast ook altijd andere passies gehad als flamencogitarist heb ik een paar maanden in spanje gezeten helaas niet bij paco lucia die ik nochtans een genie vind ook veel volksmuziek bretoense doedelzakmuziek b v indische muziek pop django reinhardt dat is mijn andere uiterste enerzijds dus heel precies werken zoals voor dit stuk maar s avonds speel ik dan graag met koen de cauter gewoon niks aan de hand wat spelen we aftellen en weg ik zou niet zonder n van de twee kunnen
5975940 dat vind ik heel moeilijk wat is jazz jazz bestaat helemaal niet meer volgens mij het is immers allemaal veel te snel gegaan door de ontwikkeling van de media vind ik louis armstrong neemt een plaat op en die konden ze dan meteen ook in new york horen dat was nog nooit vertoond en daardoor zijn stijlperiodes veel korter geworden indien bach een cd speler had gehad dan was er nooit een mozart geweest of beter gezegd dan zat die al bij berio en dat is er bij jazz gebeurd om van popmuziek nog te zwijgen er komt vanalles op je af of je dat wil of niet de beste indische fluitist geeft gewoon les in rotterdam vroeger moest je daarvoor naar de himalaya of als ie al eens langskwam moest je het weten en er vlug bij zijn
5975941 zeker maar niet zozeer dat je onmiddellijk ritmisch gaat denken nee gewoon omdat je een ander medium erbij hebt d nk je al anders als ik weet dat daar twee dansers staan ook al doen ze niks dan is de muziek reeds anders
5975942 dingen komen op me af ik neem het materiaal tot mij en wil dit op een respectvolle manier behandelen ik dien als het ware het onderwerp ik voel me er verantwoordelijk voor dit gebeurde bij het temse verhaal dit gebeurt nu opnieuw met molenbeek steeds minder vind ik het persoonlijk motief belangrijk
5975943 die plek in molenbeek is geen neutrale ruimte waar elk verhaal kan geboren worden het is een beladen ruimte een stuk op die plek kan alleen over de buurt zelf praten
5975944 belangrijk is dat ik me steeds voorhoud dat de buurtbewoners er iets moeten aan hebben dit betekent onder andere dat er veel frans zal te horen zijn de buurt is nu eenmaal hoofdzakelijk franstalig zowel italianen als marokkanen als de brusseleirs niet dat we de volkstaal willen hanteren we zijn niet van molenbeek en spreken hun taal niet we moeten niet doen alsof we maken er ons alleen belachelijk door
5975945 ideaal was geweest dat ik gedurende twee jaar in en met de buurt had kunnen werken met hen een avontuur beginnen en iets opzetten met dick maar ook hier staat de praktijk in de weg
5975946 ik weet dat we met dit project de kloof tussen het volk en de kunst niet dichten ik hoop alleen dat er een wederzijds respect ontstaat zonder dat ik verwacht dat mensen ons graag hebben
5975947 toch moet het mogelijk zijn de geschiedenis leert ons dat verheven en populair op alle echelons kunnen samen gaan denken we maar aan bijvoorbeeld moli re maar ook aan het carnaval in binche of nog aan de levende volksmuziek
5975948 ik wil geen nadruk leggen op mijn auteurschap ik verzamelde het materiaal in historische werken boeken sociologische studies teksten van en gesprekken met buurtbewoners
5975949 een gelukkig toeval de keuze van het stuk braakland aan de ransfortstraat bracht een vloedgolf aan materiaal eerst waren er de zichtbare sporen van sociale geschiedenis sporen van huisjes in de impasse maar de straat bleek als een rode draad doorheen de geschiedenis van sint jans molenbeek te lopen daarbij schonk de straat mij het personage van jan paes ik laat paes terugkeren naar zijn ransfortstraat hij ziet er de buurt vandaag juist omdat hij het verleden kent schokt het heden hem niet hij stelt integendeel vast dat de bewoners wel als losgeslagen bootjes te keer gaan uiteindelijk besluit hij de mensen hun verleden terug te geven
5975950 het is een brok samen beleefde tijd waarin het beeld van een gemeenschap zichtbaar wordt
5975951 ik geloof niet in een mogelijk model voor een betere wereld maar ik weet dat we altijd weerbaar moeten blijven fatalisme en conformisme leiden alleen maar naar meer onderdrukking onrecht uitbuiting tegentrekken dat is de boodschap als sommigen in molenbeek bezig zijn met illegale handeltjes dan is dat omdat ze een dure auto willen merkkledij liever had ik dat ze zich politiek organiseerden co peratieven oprichten nadachten over alternatieve vormen van economie opkwamen voor stemrecht ze kunnen veel van hun eigen geschiedenis leren

5975996 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
5975997 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5975998 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold

5976001 i know the academy of online gaming economy design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
5976002 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he online gaming economy industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
5976003 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a online gaming economy industry demonstrate to the general public
5976004 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
5976005 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual online gaming economy award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a online gaming economy project

5976024 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5976025 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5976026 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5976027 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world

5976032 el plus con el que los constituyentes contemplaron la situaci n de las nacionalidades hist ricas que empez a difuminarse con el refer ndum andaluz sufri ahora un recorte m s amplio creando gran inquietud en ciu y pnv la loapa en particular produjo una profunda quiebra en la confianza de los nacionalistas sobre la voluntad autonomista del psoe en algunos momentos el debate lleg a alcanzar tonos un tanto agrios la puesta en marcha de la generalizaci n auton mica contribuy a agrandar a n m s las distancias entre ellos y nosotros los nacionalistas denunciaron inmediatamente el lt gt auton mico y en algunos aspectos no les faltaban razones para ello
5976033 el t tulo viii de la constituci n y los dos primeros estatutos eran a la vez ambiguos y contradictorios por lo que convergencia y el pnv esperaban y esperan a n ir resolviendo a su favor las ambig edades y las contradicciones a lo largo de una serie de pulsos entablados con el gobierno central y ganados por la tenacidad nacionalista
5976034 quedaron en pie y han contribuido a que el curso del proceso auton mico se serenase y pasara como dicen los estudiantes de hidr ulica de un r gimen turbulento a un r gimen laminar
5976035 no solo trataba de ordenar el proceso a seguir sino que de modo notorio incid a innecesariamente en situaciones estatutarias ya reconocidas

5976042 so i find this law at work when i want to do good evil is right there with me for in my inner being i delight in gods law but i see another law at work in the members of my body waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members what a wretched man i am who will rescue me from this body of death

5976044 i remember on the sunday i went to the borehole to water the cattle and quickly returned ground my sorghum and took some rest the following day a monday i had him we named him ramaotwana after his grandfather who was a church bishop
5976045 he was an intelligent boy when he was young he would go to the goats barn and identify to us which kid was male at 12 he would go down to the manual borehole and single handedly water all the cattle
5976046 i admired his commitment to politics and i told him that when he retired even though i was his political adversary
5976047 in light of the concern of the bnf stakeholders the bnfyl central committee resolved that comrade president moupo be kindly requested to consider stepping down voluntarily from the presidency of the bnf in a dignified graceful peaceful and honourable manner befitting the person of his stature
5976048 they will write everything they think will sell their papers i always complain to the office of the city clerk if something is not well and all the information to the media will come from that office
5976049 i knew this was going to happen we were 14 in the caucus yesterday and i got 13 votes including the extra vote of the bcp councillor who promised us the vote

5976051 if you are itching for revenge all the time you will never forgive those who wronged you and in revenge there is only destruction the only thing that those who want revenge will achieve is destroy the bnf
5976052 taking tea with people does not mean that you belong to their faction once before i was attending an event in gaborone and i accepted an offer of a drink from a councillor in letshabos faction that did not mean that i belong to that faction after all comradeship is about sharing

5976063 la investigaci n tambi n demostr que hay dos caracterizaciones muy importantes dentro del pandillismo en bogot y es que los menores viven en determinados sitios pero se trasladan a otros para cometer sus fechor as
5976064 se podr n ver las micro naves principalmente en las comunicaciones en lugar de que las compa as compartan un gran sat lite incluso las peque as compa as pueden tener sus propias micro naves
5976065 para los militares la indetectabilidad tambi n es importante ya sea para aplicaciones de vigilancia o cuando intentan anular otras sat lites
5976066 y cuando esto se usa en una nave de menos de 5 kilogramos verdaderamente no puedes detectarlo a menos que est a menos de 500 metros la naves de mayor tama o puede detectarse desde m s lejos y por consiguiente ser eliminados del cielo
5976067 esto puede sonar muy trivial pero controlar la temperatura de una nave es absolutamente crucial actualmente no hay forma de hacer esto para una nave muy peque a

5976073 when people say mr tobacco farmer go do something else or grow something else in fairness they really dont understand you just cant get out of debt that easily we need help
5976074 its difficult to have worked your whole lifetime and to watch this thing unfold the way it has
5976075 people cannot pay off debt and continue to grow something different you have creditors you have financial institutions from which youve borrowed money these debts have to be paid back
5976076 we know there are many people that are welcoming an exit and need to take an exit and want to take an exit there will be a lot of farmers i anticipate taking that

5976090 most people know not to waste water just as most people realize that you should not litter
5976091 i dont see this as anything different than a shopping mall or an office building that has private security
5976092 its unacceptable when citizens feel they have to turn to private police who are not accountable to the public under the police services act not subject to standards of discipline and rules of professional conduct and over which there is no civilian oversight
5976093 when you have characters in front of your store disturbing your customers or your customers are afraid to come in i would have to go out and deal with them but we are trying to see if we can get professionals to do that because i am afraid to go out there

5976100 we made repeated calls to the owners to ensure the insurance company showed up
5976101 normal for insurance to take an active role in decision making
5976102 it was certainly odd not to see insurance the very first day let alone the third or fourth day
5976103 lets just say that when they did show up they didnt come rushing to us
5976104 the message was were not doing it because were responsible for it were doing it because it needs to be done

5976240 on the shs36 billion i want to thank nssf because the process was duly observed but on shs120 billion i do not know

5976242 we wrote to nssf yesterday asking them to give us the documents of that transaction
5976243 when somebody says ppda is in charge of consumables i dont know what they are talking about if you are buying land why dont you advertise and if you have the land why dont you do valuation
5976244 and why not follow the valuations if you have commissioned them other than coming up and saying the price of land in this particular place is 30 million because how are you determining the market prices the bottom line is that you are spending public funds and you have to be accountable
5976245 its funny that when some officials decided to buy some land at nsimbe estate some time back using nssf funds at shs9 million per acre they were arrested and terminated from work but this time when workers money has been mismanaged everyone is silent

5976299 without getting into the specific details of the nicholls steyn report if you were to read that youd probably share our concerns
5976300 from a players perspective we need to be absolutely sure that if were recommending that players go into an environment like this that we need to be comfortable that theyre going to be safe and reading that report we couldnt be
5976301 reg has never let us down so yes we put a lot of faith in what he has to say

5976305 if the icc decide that it will take place in pakistan then it will i guess become cricket australias decision as to whether australia participates if cricket australia make the decision to send a team then and only then will it become a players decision talk of a boycott and all of those sort of things are some way off and i dont expect that it will get to that point

5976310 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5976311 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be part of georgias future
5976312 theres no room for debate on this matter the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the us fully recognizes this reality
5976313 one indication that some russians may have been pulled back was a georgian army barracks in gori which was full of russian soldiers on sunday but was nearly deserted today except for a lone tank standing guard

5976328 but it could have been worse in my opinion i saw people standing up for j roll i heard some claps even though its pretty hard to hear way up here

5976336 webtv insights and perspectives a web 2 0 phenomenon is coining new tv usage patterns
5976337 this set was built exactly 20 minutes before i walked on to it to shoot
5976338 they were nailing the floorboards down and i came in and the beds themselves the inside was all stone theyd discussed slate which i thought they meant was a color it was not supposed to be a coffin and i freaked out
5976339 they are supposed to feel a little bit like coffins but when they were stone they felt like not just dracula but like louis jourdan
5976340 isnt going to be buried like the pilot of firefly
5976341 a completely organic experience from the lunch i had with eliza which is something ive done a few times with her to going home and my wife saying yeah it sounds like the next thing just because you can tell
5976342 a week after eliza and i had lunch i went in
5976343 we are kind of living in a fish bowl a little bit
5976344 sometimes i dont like people to see the man behind the curtain i dont like them to know that something wasnt awesome before they saw it
5976345 you know the things we had to tweak the things we had to cut that is inevitable
5976346 but now i dont think it is just us the whole world is so much about seeing behind the curtain and seeing how things are made and how they work and the extended cut and what we could have done and what we didnt do and the alternate ending and you just you kind of take it as part and parcel at the beginning
5976347 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5976348 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5976349 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5976350 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5976351 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5976352 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5976353 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5976354 yeah ill face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been
5976355 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 1030 hours 0830 gmt
5976356 the operation had been hailed as a success by doctors but the presidents condition remained serious
5976357 the reject shop is well positioned for future growth underpinned by continued improvement in existing stores as well as a robust store rollout program
5976358 sales for the first few weeks of this year have been very pleasing and the new store openings have been to plan
5976359 this is a very pleasing result for the company in the face of general market uncertainty and the impact on consumer confidence caused by high interest rates and petrol prices particularly in the second half
5976360 this result reflects our continuing focus on retail fundamentals in offering our customers great value in the products we sell
5976361 with the potential to open 400 stores nationally we are now focused on the steps we need to take to ensure we have the capacity to continue to grow while maintaining a focus on the day to day needs of the business
5976362 everyone seems to be piling back into the resource stocks which are up about 3 7 per cent
5976363 it has gained a little bit more than it lost yesterday when it was down 2 7 per cent
5976364 theres an appetite out there to invest somewhere but no one is sure where to invest
5976365 local financial stocks were down in early trade but started to rally towards the end of the day
5976366 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyse search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us
5976367 if we come again and again with innovation that matters we will have the opportunity to grow our volume and our share
5976368 we made decent progress but we have a ways to go
5976369 we think that tech natural language processing is going to be a very critical way for us to improve relevance further at scale
5976370 these are the domains where we have domain specific task oriented interfaces
5976371 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5976372 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5976373 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5976374 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5976375 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5976376 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5976377 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5976378 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5976379 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5976380 in the future this new knowledge can be incorporated into developing new repellents and may be in control strategies for culex quinquefasciatus and other mosquitoes
5976381 presents as a very logical basis to help us understand how deet is perceived by the mosquitoes and this work provides an excellent explanation to link physiological processing within the mosquito to the macroscopic behavioral response that we observe in laboratory bioassays with this repellent
5976382 all we can do logically about the situation we have done
5976383 this is now beyond logic if they are haunted by horror stories then there is little more we can do
5976384 a very negative report based on a one day stay in karachi simply advising them not to tour
5976385 for example they met men with hands on experience of the afghan situation with real connections and people who know what is going on in the country and the various threats
5976386 they were told there is no feasible threat to the tournament
5976387 it appears that no matter what he bruce sprago says tim may questions the ability of the pakistan authorities to deliver the plan
5976388 debemos jugar muy bien este partido ellas son el equipo n mero uno del mundo confiamos en ganarles porque so amos con ganar el oro

5976391 userful software programs are becoming recognized as the new global standard in green computing on linux and represent a significant growth opportunity
5976392 userfuls products are unique in the marketplace and avacs investment which will be repaid through revenues over time will help the company take better advantage of the global opportunities their technology presents it will also help userful attract third party risk capital to its user friendly technology
5976393 weve got a very successful product and this money is strategically important because of what it will help us do the investment is also a vote of confidence in userful and our long term approach to the companys development
5976394 the fund addresses a shortage of available funding from third party investors for new and existing companies it also provides mentoring marketing and operational guidance and other support to help alberta businesses become competitive in both local and global markets

5976396 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will be confined in the transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
5976397 our project is a response to the fact that the molecular systems people are building today are now so complex and their behavior so intricate that future progress hinges on developing the intellectual and practical tools for mastering that complexity the kinds of tools that computer science has already developed for silicon computers
5976398 the molecular programming project is one of the outputs from our investment in the information science and technology ist initiative over the years
5976399 the expeditions program is intended to identify future directions in computing that have the potential to lead to revolutionary changes the collaborations between the various investigators many of which were funded by ist were instrumental in bringing together the team of researchers who are embarking on this project
5976400 ambitious fundamental research agendas that promise to define the future of computing and information

5976402 during this time of year poison ivy is no 1
5976403 in the summer we see a lot of poison ivy at mount sinai
5976404 im seeing five to 10 cases of poison ivy a week
5976405 you can go to a neighbors house and pet a dog
5976406 and the dog can have the oleoresin in his fur for a week after being exposed to the plant
5976407 the vapors go up in the air and can saturate someones skin
5976408 at its peak ipv6 represented less than one hundredth of 1 percent of internet traffic
5976409 this is somewhat equivalent to the allowed parts of contaminants in drinking water
5976410 we believe this is the largest study of ipv6 and internet traffic in general to date by several orders of magnitude
5976411 though not a landslide of adoption it is still something
5976412 it really calmed me down it made me think you can give any little extra energy any piece of yourself you have left you dont have to save anything johnson said
5976413 going into that last routine i didnt care what score i got i just wanted to hit the best routine i could to finish off my experience and not have any regrets
5976414 i didnt want to leave here thinking i could have done better finishing off that routine knowing i hit the best routine i could at the time it felt amazing
5976415 she tumbles on the beam like other people tumble on the floor
5976416 and we were awakened to the fact that infectious diseases like tuberculosis really had never left
5976417 at the proteins active site the computer tries to fit drug like molecules into it to block it
5976418 with the inhibitor bound to it and try to improve on it
5976419 no matter the disease the process is always the same
5976420 whats challenging or unusual thats what keeps my job exciting
5976421 something that strikes you where you think you can make a difference
5976422 if i think someone has never tried something thats the drive for me to get into it
5976423 sometimes we try an idea and it doesnt work but being an academic means we have the freedom to try new ideas and approaches to solve a long standing problem
5976424 we stay in the olympic family under these humiliating terms only because we value the precious international recognition through sports something we can never think of in power play diplomacy
5976425 i think it is a great pity that baseball has been dropped from the olympic games
5976426 it was a great promotion for us as long as we were playing baseball in the olympics countries paid attention to us
5976427 everywhere we go we speak the same language and see familiar faces

5976433 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
5976434 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your head to be professional
5976435 i have no doubt that we must be here i am also in shock but i tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again i would do it again
5976436 not the patrol and the sequence of events but the choice which led me to confirm the decision of my predecessors to send the french army here
5976437 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the the world here we are fighting against terrorism

5976441 the most significant changes are that weve kind of taken a step forward in the amount of functionality that you can deliver in a very short period of time
5976442 you can drag and drop widgets and then connect them visually to back end data or back end web services
5976443 this was an evolutionary change to the microsoft licensing that everyone expected
5976444 they introduced the kind of flexibility that you would expect for microsoft applications in virtual environments but its not all roses for certain customers
5976445 you dont have to have every target machine licensed ahead of time
5976446 we do not have a huge presence in china or the pacific rim
5976447 as a b to c company we have to have a better understanding of what our end users are using
5976448 thats something we could never have found out in our labs
5976449 in principal this is bad news for ferrovial the only positive reading that can be given is that ferrovial could take advantage of the asset sale to further reduce debt and operate baa with fewer obstacles
5976450 we did not reckon with an increase of the guidance
5976451 the numbers were light of expectations but better intl mobile masks a huge deterioration in domestic mobile
5976452 earnings visibility is still lacking this counters telekom austrias attractive valuation
5976453 the market is pretty trigger happy at the moment if theres missed numbers
5976454 but i dont see this as a big shock like we saw before because it is largely seasonal and exceptional factors and i think the guidance is still achievable
5976455 we surrounded the area and made sure that no warrior escapes
5976456 we managed to kill at least six warriors captured three and also recovered nine guns
5976457 over the past few years tower has substantially improved its revenue and operational results as evidenced by becoming the number one revenue growth foundry for 2007 over 2005 todays announcement of a memorandum of understanding signed with our banks and israel corporation provides a much stronger corporate capital structure from which we can continue this momentum we expect that these financial improvements combined with the expected closing of the jazz merger will maintain our growth trajectory while substantially improving ebitda and cash generation in the course of transitioning into the worldwide leading specialty foundry
5976458 the response from both the jazz and tower customers with regard to the combined product platform offerings and roadmaps has been overwhelmingly positive and we have begun to leverage the cross selling opportunities through joint meetings with customers of both companies integration efforts are well underway in anticipation of the completion of the transaction by the end of this quarter we have established an inter company cross functional team tasked with ensuring a seamless transition and we expect to realize approximately 40 million in annual cost savings from the jazz merger
5976459 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of reeducation through labour can she serve
5976460 but they can also be taken away at any time
5976461 this is part of the tough tactics used to intimidate and silence protesters
5976462 of course its of concern that china will use a system thats clearly beyond the pale in terms of international standards in terms of arbitrary deprivation of freedoms and liberties to do that
5976463 we have no records of these two names in our system
5976464 our goal is to provide a forum for focused collaboration to solve interesting and difficult performance problems tuneup gives developers deep visibility and relevant information to debug and improve the performance of their application and a community setting to collaborate with others to solve tough problems

5976466 adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
5976467 kay and i hope that all adrians good work will be continued by all those who knew and loved him
5976468 what we want to see is a participation to the costs of running the olympic games of training the athletes around the world which is then reflected in the rights fee
5976469 we will be engaging with the chinese media market quite soon after these games
5976470 our expectation is that there will be a multiple increase in the rights fee that will just reflect the status of china as a major sporting and economic entity
5976471 for the next games just for china i think we have to be looking well into three figures
5976472 but of course these are discussions that we have to undertake in china
5976473 almost all the money 92 per cent of the money that comes into the ioc that comes from either television rights and also sponsorship gets disbursed back to the organisation of the olympic games and also goes back to sports through the national olympic committees
5976474 the level of competition that there will be in china for those rights thats a matter for the chinese authorities
5976475 from our perspective its important that we focus on making sure that we get a fair contribution to the cost of the games and the cost of training the athletes
5976476 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just it is an honour for france and its army to defend it

5976479 the two people in her vehicle were making noise as she drove to bugolobi the police team heard the screams and waved her down
5976480 i made it i finally won a gold medal i cant stop smiling im so excited
5976481 but i go by everything happens for a reason and for some reason the judges were giving me scores im not used to but they had a reason
5976482 it did upset me a little but i thought about it and i decided i was at the olympic games i was having the time of my life and im winning medals
5976483 when you do get silver you feel different emotions but i looked back and appreciated that i had a medal
5976484 if it were gold it might feel differently i dont know how to explain it i definitely came to appreciate it i wouldnt trade my silver medals for anything in the world not even gold
5976485 the more mistakes you make in practice the more you worry
5976486 i wanted to do my best routine i didnt want to leave the olympics thinking i could do better
5976487 t he lightning fast transition from newly minted vaccine to must have injection in the united states and europe represents a triumph of what the manufacturers call education and their critics call marketing
5976488 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
5976489 health economists estimate that depending on how they are used the two cervical cancer vaccines will cost society 30 000 to 70 000 or higher for each year of life they save in developed countries

5976491 la econom a melillense sufre un claro abandono por parte del gobierno local

5976496 mcdougle is pushing hes got two more preseason games so well know more then
5976497 this has become one of those situations where theres competition between mcdougle and chris clemons
5976498 we have to get chris back on the field until we get him back on the field were just not going to know
5976499 i just want to stay focused on staying on the field
5976500 thats been the biggest thing in my whole career the injuries
5976501 as long as i stay on the field and play up to my potential everything else is going to fall into place im not there yet i just want to keep improving
5976502 it sets you back a lot when you cant go out and compete and be at the top of your game stay in shape and practice
5976503 we need as many healthy players as we can get right now
5976504 when ive been out there its been going well ive been able to pick up the defense ive been able to go out and show some of the things im capable of doing show some of the reasons they brought me in here its unfortunate the injury has come at a critical time
5976505 i think its just hey the best players are going to play
5976506 i can say i think hes come a long way

5976514 we need one building and about 25 acres 10 hectares
5976515 the last phase of that is site specific so were waiting to find a site and complete the environmental impact assessment
5976516 we would need 5 000 acres of energy beets in the ground next spring
5976517 we dont look at this as food or fuel we looked at it as food and fuel
5976518 for 10 years we became accustomed to the canadian dollar at 75 to 80 cents which fundamentally meant for an american coming up here you come up for two days and the third day is free
5976519 you put all of those together and the numbers from the u s are down theres no doubt about that at all
5976520 when consumer confidence is shaken discretionary expenditures like travel are affected
5976521 that same day visitor from the united states has just been disappearing there has been some effort to shift marketing in the u s to a longer haul visitor
5976522 i encourage hoteliers all the time to look at your market and then make sure that you devote your resources very very carefully to that
5976523 a lot of the international visitors that have come to canada those travel decisions were made six eight ten months ago
5976524 although we may see gas prices impacting some short term decision making we really havent started to feel the effects of it
5976525 both the forest industry and its government partners need to focus on the long term
5976526 a better partnership is required to address the underlying competitiveness of the forest industry as well as explore emerging opportunities in terms of new markets and products

5976546 canadian financials have to be treated quite differently were nowhere near the pain of writeoffs that have been endured by u s and european financials
5976547 the real story of this summer is the u s dollar rally and commodity prices going down which has triggered some rotation out of resource stocks and into financials so weve gone from a very dramatic oversold condition for banks to pretty much overbought conditions a few days ago
5976548 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5976549 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5976550 im not happy its come to this but ive been excluded from the decision making and dont have a lot to say
5976551 right now it looks like one of the largest crops ever
5976552 its just a matter of scrounging up enough heat units to get things ripe
5976553 luckily we were blessed with three weeks of incredible weather in july
5976554 it was a beautiful kick start to the season without that wed be having problems
5976555 we had excellent growing conditions up until mid july but now were looking for some heat
5976556 i think the crop looks pretty good from a yield standpoint

5976577 the slow down in turnover growth reflects the worsening of economic condition in the country which has led to a significant reduction in tariff and underlying customer usage
5976578 in addition the sri lankan government has recently required mobile service operators to mandatorily enforce stricter requirements on the collection of personal identification details for new and existing customers from july 2008
5976579 as a result htll has tightened the policy for prepaid customers to ensure that sold prepaid cards are only included in the customer base after the customer has registered with htll the required personal details
5976580 this will result in a substantial downward revision in the reported customer base that will likely be applied in q3 2008 once the impact can be fully quantified
5976581 however we continue to experience lower minutes of use per customer putting downward pressure on arpu as difficult economic conditions began to have a more noticeable impact on the market
5976582 it should be noted that while it is expected that our customer base will be reduced there will be no impact on the operations financial results and cashflow of htll

5976584 per jaar komt nu n op de twintig koopwoningen in nederland vrij voor de verkoop voor woningzoekenden is dus steeds minder aanbod beschikbaar ook al omdat het aanbod van nieuwbouwwoningen achterblijft bij de vraag
5976585 omdat er te weinig huizen beschikbaar zijn kost een volgende woning mensen vaak een paar ton meer dat is een gigantische investering

5976672 i just told myself what i always tell myself keep things tight but its kind of like a car when youre racing a car and youre going max velocity and you hit a curb either you can maintain control or you crash and burn today i crashed and burned i crossed the line and it was very hard to pick myself back up
5976673 i thought i was going to run 48 seconds i felt so good
5976674 i was already getting a bit elated coming off the turns because i know how my races usually go i just had a really tough break on that one my hamstring just really let me down
5976675 i dont want to tell you what im thinking right now because its not positive
5976676 every championship ive been to ive come up short and its not for a want of trying
5976677 i go out there with every intention to run my best race and i always come into the race very prepared so once again to lose in a major championship and not just any major championship the olympic games and thinking of waiting for four more years is way too much
5976678 you have to get over all 10 if you cant youre not meant to be the champion
5976679 so today i was not meant to be the champion todays hard tomorrow is going to be harder

5976699 dear exe i spotted yet another error in your printing in columns program from june
5976700 this news has come as a great shock to everyone including it seems his own wife and family
5976701 in the past 24 hours it has been brought to our attention that the mans illness is not what we have been led to believe
5976702 the man has confirmed that he is not suffering with a terminal illness and is seeking professional help in adelaide with the support of his family
5976703 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5976704 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
5976705 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5976706 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5976707 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
5976708 daniels in contract and everyone seems to be pointing the bone at us with daniel
5976709 i think hes a fantastic player hes 25 years of age but he is contracted to the west coast eagles i dare say hell probably finish his career at west coast
5976710 but i do like watching daniel play so if west coast said he was available wed sit down and have a look see what they wanted and wed go from there if we could do the deal
5976711 weve got an idea of our deficiencies and a pretty good idea of where we need to improve so wed be pretty open to whatever was put on the table
5976712 weve got hampson and kreuzer that are going to grow into men but we need to be mindful that we cant ask boys to do a mans job week in week out
5976713 we could really let ourselves down if we think thats it cue in the rack oh well weve done a pretty good job and be happy well no
5976714 this competition goes for 22 weeks and the standards we set will have a big imprint on 2009

5976720 the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5976721 the move will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medalists
5976722 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift
5976723 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5976724 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5976725 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5976726 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5976727 we dont feel its appropriate he spends his time hopping from one country to the next one while countries decide what to do with him
5976728 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was
5976729 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
5976730 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied for me its not about the disability at all
5976731 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
5976732 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your head to be professional
5976733 i have no doubt that we must be here i am also in shock but i tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again i would do it again
5976734 not the patrol and the sequence of events but the choice which led me to confirm the decision of my predecessors to send the french army here
5976735 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the the world here we are fighting against terrorism
5976736 ryan obviously gives us a few things especially since hes a backrower that will play 80 minutes and theres not many of them
5976737 but jeremys been playing great all year though he probably wont get the 80 minutes and sikas been going very well
5976738 itll be a camp situation itll be a bit of a change of environment a change of surroundings for the players and hopefully that will help freshen things up
5976739 but we didnt want to play penrith have a bus trip back to the airport and then fly and do the same thing two days later
5976740 i suppose it comes back to the team i sort of need to repay them for not putting my hand up and sticking with them
5976741 its one of those things you feel like youre letting them down
5976742 i just want to go out there and try and work hard the rest of the season for them
5976743 we worked on that at the start of the year
5976744 we sat down and looked at the tackle on cross and there wasnt much more i could do
5976745 i tackled low and fell backwards and he went over me
5976746 its just one of those things i wont change my tackling technique
5976747 i thought it the suspension was pretty harsh but im pretty happy with the way he has been training
5976748 hes an imposing figure and not too many blokes like to run straight at him his presence in the line up is a huge boost to the players around him
5976749 its going to be a tough game they are coming off a loss and they are always hard to beat there and the game is just as crucial to them as it is to us
5976750 they come with big game experience they are all players in internationals and state of origin so you hope they bring that sort of attitude
5976751 weve also said the green energy has to be in addition to victorias existing renewable energy targets and those two commitments make it very clear that it will be additional green power that is sourced to meet the governments commitments
5976752 and i think that shows the governments credibility in ensuring the impact of this plant is minimised
5976753 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards
5976754 the government made the decision to go ahead with it so they are not going to come up with an ees that says its not a goer it was a fait accompli
5976755 no long term or irreversible damage to the environment from the project has been identified
5976756 australian judges just dont vote according to the colour of the government that appoints them im delighted to say
5976757 if youre asking me whether there are things that i could have done differently or better the answer is yes of course there were
5976758 you ask me what they were the answer is ive forgotten
5976759 the constitution decrees that in 10 days time i reach an advanced age i become unfit for office
5976760 we all know that there are people over 70 who have all their equipment and we all know that there may be some people under 70 who dont
5976761 but its unfair to put people in a position where they have to judge themselves
5976762 if i had found a case in which i couldnt conscientiously apply the law i would have resigned
5976763 actually i dont have many plans for the next chapter of my life im looking forward to being surprised
5976764 our primary focus is on informing doctors of the changes so they can review the treatment of patients currently on avandia or avandamet in accordance with the changes to the product information
5976765 patients using avandia or avandamet should continue taking their medication but make an appointment with their doctor to review their treatment as soon as possible
5976766 i dont agree with it because we know that avandia in combination therapy is highly effective and the evidence that theres any adverse outcome of using it in triple therapy is very very minimal
5976767 not being able to use it will put people at a disadvantage
5976768 given all these matters i am satisfied that there are special circumstances
5976769 they also support a conclusion that there is no risk of flight
5976770 this is an application in which bail should be issued
5976771 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
5976772 the republicans have taken that first type of patriotism that muscular military rockets red glare type of patriotism and driven that as a wedge against people they see democrats liberals as weak on national security issues
5976773 i think the patriotism question in this case is being wrapped into this larger issue that hes not one of us
5976774 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5976775 it showed that hed put a campaign victory ahead of a military victory
5976776 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5976777 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
5976778 valuable because not everyone sits in front of a computer or a television
5976779 at getting votes on election day and communicating the messages that we feel are important to our supporters
5976780 text messaging is really powerful if i have a text message i can forward that text message to over 100 people in my cell phone list
5976781 its going to be read by every single person have you ever not read a text message
5976782 we just didnt turn up on the day and hopefully thats something that wont happen again this year
5976783 its given us that big wake up call that we needed
5976784 we were disappointed with ourselves and thought we were a better team than that
5976785 what was worse than him hasler ripping in is he didnt say much
5976786 its like when youre a kid and you want your parents to blow up to let you know it was wrong but when they say im just disappointed in you it hurts even more
5976787 you get scared almost he was just thoroughly disappointed which we all were
5976788 its just a title where you are recognised as the most consistent side and youve played the most consistent footy all year
5976789 we just want to win the next three games the cheque doesnt come into it
5976790 i think back to back losses makes anyone cranky and im sure des will have them cranky and theyll be ready to play
5976791 will ensure that california remains in the forefront of reducing our carbon footprint and conserving valuable natural resources while also protecting our economy
5976792 our members applaud the governor for his leadership in encouraging our industry to adopt feasible and cost effective technologies that ultimately will produce some of the most sustainable buildings in the nation
5976793 nrdc has many concerns regarding the stringency of this code and its market impacts

5976807 if you keep on keeping on and stay focused you can go all the way
5976808 dreams really do come true if you believe that they can and work hard to make them a reality
5976809 its just a matter of taking your god given talent and staying on the right path no matter what obstacles get in your way
5976810 coach called and told me that dawn had won im like hopefully ill be able to go out there work hard and go to the olympics and do well like jjk and dawn did

5976822 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
5976823 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
5976824 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
5976825 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
5976826 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
5976827 because i could see it wasnt going anywhere if i didnt do that

5976856 this action of placing rewards on the heads of our commanders i dont think it will help
5976857 it will only aggravate their frustration it will only aggravate their outrage
5976858 i will be compelled to tell the people of my country that they must now be prepared to suffer more sanctions and international isolation as we pursue a better more durable democracy

5976895 our primary focus is on informing doctors of the changes so they can review the treatment of patients currently on avandia or avandamet in accordance with the changes to the product information
5976896 patients using avandia or avandamet should continue taking their medication but make an appointment with their doctor to review their treatment as soon as possible
5976897 i dont agree with it because we know that avandia in combination therapy is highly effective and the evidence that theres any adverse outcome of using it in triple therapy is very very minimal
5976898 not being able to use it will put people at a disadvantage
5976899 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5976900 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5976901 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5976902 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5976903 we dont feel its appropriate he spends his time hopping from one country to the next one while countries decide what to do with him
5976904 the success of this nature reserve is a tribute to partnership working the trust is grateful in particular for all the co operation and practical help received from hanson local councils wharfedale naturalists society nidderdale aonb and last but not least our wonderful and ever willing team of volunteers
5976905 it is fantastic to think that this site now acts as a safe haven for wildlife the transformation from a working quarry to outstanding nature reserve will have lasting social and environmental benefits for the local community
5976906 we are grateful for the input of the ownrt and also to the town council and local volunteers who have helped make the restoration of otley quarry such a success
5976907 because it is so much more environmentally friendly than conventional hot mix asphalt and with all the focus on the environment and carbon taxes and going green these kinds of processes i think are going to become very popular

5976924 hes been doing quite a bit of physical work this week in particular and all indications are that he feels fine he feels ready to go but probably the final decision will be made by the neuro surgeon
5976925 i think if the neuro surgeon says hes okay wed strongly consider jason to play wed just go back to when he finished with the concussion
5976926 i thought he was in good form he was playing with an understanding he had a shoulder injury he could perform with so wed go back to that and start to make our assessment of whether he fits into our side and he was a pretty important player for us before he got concussed
5976927 there was some discussion of whether to call all bets off and just let trent get into pre season now i didnt want that to happen in discussion with trent we thought it was better for him to rehab his hamstring and try to make himself available for any games that are left whether it be afl or for woodville west torrens
5976928 i think the more trent plays the better off hell be hes missed a lot of footy and he needs to get himself in a whole range of situations so he can get confident in that need
5976929 the only way he can do that is play not rehab and run around ovals

5976933 daarom stelde de monnikengemeenschap van de trappistenabdij van westmalle de productiebeperking die al jaren geldt opnieuw in vraag er werd echter beslist de beperking te handhaven
5976934 als we meer zouden willen brouwen zou de brouwinstallatie grondig aangepast en uitgebreid moeten worden ten tweede hechten de monniken heel veel belang aan een beperkte productie op mensenmaat
5976935 we zouden ook een extra ploeg kunnen inzetten of overwerk toestaan maar daar zijn we niet voor we vinden het belangrijk dat onze lekenmedewerkers op een redelijk uur naar huis kunnen gaan zodat er tijd rest voor hun familiale en sociale leven we willen ook het persoonlijke contact behouden met die mensen en dat is bij een schaalvergroting misschien niet meer mogelijk
5976936 om dat zoveel mogelijk te vermijden verdeelt de trappistenbrouwerij het beschikbare bier op een eerlijke en billijke manier zowel over grote als kleinere distributiepunten

5976948 weve also said the green energy has to be in addition to victorias existing renewable energy targets and those two commitments make it very clear that it will be additional green power that is sourced to meet the governments commitments
5976949 and i think that shows the governments credibility in ensuring the impact of this plant is minimised
5976950 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards
5976951 the government made the decision to go ahead with it so they are not going to come up with an ees that says its not a goer it was a fait accompli
5976952 no long term or irreversible damage to the environment from the project has been identified
5976953 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5976954 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
5976955 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5976956 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5976957 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
5976958 australian judges just dont vote according to the colour of the government that appoints them im delighted to say

5976961 the constitution decrees that in 10 days time i reach an advanced age i become unfit for office
5976962 we all know that there are people over 70 who have all their equipment and we all know that there may be some people under 70 who dont

5976964 if i had found a case in which i couldnt conscientiously apply the law i would have resigned
5976965 actually i dont have many plans for the next chapter of my life im looking forward to being surprised
5976966 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
5976967 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your head to be professional

5976969 not the patrol and the sequence of events but the choice which led me to confirm the decision of my predecessors to send the french army here
5976970 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the the world here we are fighting against terrorism
5976971 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes
5976972 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth

5976979 this theater was gorgeous we went to see iron man and had none of the problems others have mentioned since i have what is a nearly phobic dread of going to super crowded theaters i almost always go to matinees so we took advantage of the free parking woot and checked it out the seats were fine i didnt notice the chemical smell but i have allergies so who knows the movie was in one of the smaller theaters and it was fine i was so bowled over by the gorgeous remodel job that it cast the rosy glow over everything else the kids at the counter were still getting used to the routine but they were all sweet and very courteous so we were willing to cut them slack on register errors as someone who lived in alameda for years without a theater i was delighted that they opened up hopefully the kinks other encountered will clear up as the staff gets more comfortable i still remember the old theater out at southshore my last trip there was the week before it closed sitting watching the movie while rain was pouring in through the ceiling this is a huge step up from that

5976983 i suppose it comes back to the team i sort of need to repay them for not putting my hand up and sticking with them
5976984 its one of those things you feel like youre letting them down
5976985 i just want to go out there and try and work hard the rest of the season for them
5976986 we worked on that at the start of the year
5976987 we sat down and looked at the tackle on cross and there wasnt much more i could do
5976988 i tackled low and fell backwards and he went over me
5976989 its just one of those things i wont change my tackling technique
5976990 i thought it the suspension was pretty harsh but im pretty happy with the way he has been training
5976991 hes an imposing figure and not too many blokes like to run straight at him his presence in the line up is a huge boost to the players around him
5976992 its going to be a tough game they are coming off a loss and they are always hard to beat there and the game is just as crucial to them as it is to us
5976993 they come with big game experience they are all players in internationals and state of origin so you hope they bring that sort of attitude
5976994 we were pretty lucky on the weekend the teams we needed to get beaten got beaten
5976995 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was
5976996 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
5976997 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied for me its not about the disability at all
5976998 ryan obviously gives us a few things especially since hes a backrower that will play 80 minutes and theres not many of them
5976999 but jeremys been playing great all year though he probably wont get the 80 minutes and sikas been going very well
5977000 itll be a camp situation itll be a bit of a change of environment a change of surroundings for the players and hopefully that will help freshen things up

5977007 i had done coaching with newcastle in schools before especially kicking skills
5977008 some of them had previously found certain skills difficult to then suddenly see them actually do these skills saying how much it had helped was just fantastic
5977009 the kids i had were so good they would give everything they were an absolute pleasure to work with
5977010 its a great feeling to give them the chance to really push their ambitions to help them play better
5977011 the hotshots experience has definitely made me consider going into coaching working with kids i think steve black newcastle falcons fitness coach and dave aldred kicking coach who were also helping out would also say the same
5977012 to be honest i never thought it would change my life as much as it has and for the better

5977045 i think hes a fantastic player hes 25 years of age but he is contracted to the west coast eagles i dare say hell probably finish his career at west coast
5977046 but i do like watching daniel play so if west coast said he was available wed sit down and have a look see what they wanted and wed go from there if we could do the deal
5977047 weve got an idea of our deficiencies and a pretty good idea of where we need to improve so wed be pretty open to whatever was put on the table
5977048 weve got hampson and kreuzer that are going to grow into men but we need to be mindful that we cant ask boys to do a mans job week in week out

5977056 its given us that big wake up call that we needed
5977057 we were disappointed with ourselves and thought we were a better team than that
5977058 what was worse than him hasler ripping in is he didnt say much
5977059 its like when youre a kid and you want your parents to blow up to let you know it was wrong but when they say im just disappointed in you it hurts even more
5977060 you get scared almost he was just thoroughly disappointed which we all were
5977061 its just a title where you are recognised as the most consistent side and youve played the most consistent footy all year
5977062 we just want to win the next three games the cheque doesnt come into it

5977073 hes been doing quite a bit of physical work this week in particular and all indications are that he feels fine he feels ready to go but probably the final decision will be made by the neuro surgeon
5977074 i think if the neuro surgeon says hes okay wed strongly consider jason to play wed just go back to when he finished with the concussion
5977075 i thought he was in good form he was playing with an understanding he had a shoulder injury he could perform with so wed go back to that and start to make our assessment of whether he fits into our side and he was a pretty important player for us before he got concussed
5977076 there was some discussion of whether to call all bets off and just let trent get into pre season now i didnt want that to happen in discussion with trent we thought it was better for him to rehab his hamstring and try to make himself available for any games that are left whether it be afl or for woodville west torrens
5977077 i think the more trent plays the better off hell be hes missed a lot of footy and he needs to get himself in a whole range of situations so he can get confident in that need
5977078 the only way he can do that is play not rehab and run around ovals
5977079 if youre a player you just think theyre in there discussing me but those scenarios we have to think about burton and hentschel do come into your decision making
5977080 sometimes an individual player doesnt want to hear that and i would fully understand why but thats us making the best decision for the club overall

5977110 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
5977111 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act
5977112 you can have a string quartet but were not sure you can have a dj
5977113 not in terms of eliminating the parties and receptions that surround the conventions but in terms of curbing the real influence buying events that involved lobbyists and lobbying organizations spending six figure amounts for parties that really were parties thrown by the members themselves

5977115 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader

5977137 the republicans have taken that first type of patriotism that muscular military rockets red glare type of patriotism and driven that as a wedge against people they see democrats liberals as weak on national security issues
5977138 i think the patriotism question in this case is being wrapped into this larger issue that hes not one of us
5977139 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory

5977179 i see that john carlson is working solo this week on his afternoon show so its a good week to listen which i dont usually do due to the shram factor to kvi in the afternoon
5977180 ive attempted to listen to the commentators but frankly ken schram is a narcissistic buffoon and unlistenable its a shame because i like john carlson and will miss his point of view
5977181 the seattle market is flooded to the point of over saturation with the liberal viewpoint in all forms of media print television radio internet that was precisely why i tuned in to kvi i enjoyed the commute with carlson schramm just idiotically repeats the leftist dogma with absolutely zero thought or analysis of the words coming out of his mouth
5977182 in listening today i restrained myself from yelling at the radio and im a peace loving normally mild mannered guy schram
5977183 i absolutely hate ken schram i dislike him so bad that i just cant listen to the radio while i work work is tough enough as it is without the distraction of ken schram i consider him hugely obnoxious impolite and somewhat of a dullard i dont mind the guy having an opposing view but i just cant get around his attitude but i did give it a try i lasted about 5 to 10 minutes

5977189 with our previous telephony solution we often felt that important phone calls were missed due to our small workforce and travelling demands the gohello solution has overcome this as calls are now routed directly to employees mobiles our customers may not have noticed our new telephone system but that can only be a good thing by using gohello we dont need to worry about taking messages keeping the office manned or costly business calls leaving us to do what we do best running the business

5977211 i think in the coming period we are going to have to answer to that because if that statement is going to be the guiding light for the anc then i think we are completely on the wrong route i cannot see that south africa can be different from so many of the african countries which have got excellent documents on paper but when it comes to practice its completely something different i think if in the end that is really what we have fought for or what we are expected to have fought for and so on then freedom will never really dawn on our side

5977220 the law enforcement agencies have compiled lists of so called adherents of wahhabism including practically all young mosque goers
5977221 every one of these 400 people is under round the clock surveillance and the law enforcement agencies are ready to take any measures against them including physical elimination
5977222 having lengthened the list many times began an active campaign against completely innocent muslims who frequented mosques under the guise of battling against religious extremism
5977223 in this way our truly believing upright and selfless sons were recorded as wahhabis
5977224 i dont go to mosque dont fast dont practise daily prayers its absolutely clear to me that the people on this list have been registered according to the principles of the nkvd stalinist secret police
5977225 and there were none there were some local police lists not of wahhabis unofficial documents
5977226 note down who was there and watch who goes there as part of routine and so people began talking about lists
5977227 we were all on a list so he ended up being a car mechanic
5977228 even then the special services found out and told his boss to get rid of that muslim unless you want problems
5977229 of course im on their list as a potential mujahid muslim warrior

5977237 ah of course yes but i think the brilliant thing about the rose of tralee is that its an event that television covers you know its not a television programme it would happen anyway and i think when you get that into your head it works for the people in the dome
5977238 i dont remember a time when i didnt watch it
5977239 i wanted to do it always when i was 17 i was told that i had to wait until i was 18 and then i went to college and was studying and i was in london for a few years

5977241 im just living every moment im just in the moment im sure the nerves will come just beforehand but at the moment its just amazing

5977252 team gbs excellence has left the rest of the world shaking their heads

5977254 they have stirred in british breasts a pride and confidence which can be transformative
5977255 of 16 golds so far for team gb had prompted olympic team managers to set their sights on a total of 20 gold medals from the beijing games
5977256 it bodes so well for 2012 and i think the whole nation is totally delighted and really proud at everything thats been achieved
5977257 britain are rampant as these olympics because we threw money at them
5977258 i have fought against white domination and i have fought against black domination i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities it is an ideal which i hope to live for and to achieve but if needs be it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die
5977259 a democracy in which the government whomever that government may be will be bound by a higher set of rules embodied in a constitution and will not be able govern the country as it pleases
5977260 i hold out a hand of friendship to the leaders of all parties and their members
5977261 an anc government will serve all the people of south africa not just anc members
5977262 south africas story is embodied by your heroic sacrifice and your breathtaking walk out of the darkness and into the glorious light but you are always the first to say that the real heroes of south africas transformation are its people who first walked away from the past and now move with determination patience and courage toward a new day

5977265 i think he has been quite an effective governor in many areas but at this point in time it is hard to see how he would bring strength to the ticket in the national security area which i think the american public will be looking for in this election
5977266 but it may well be that his achievements as governor which i think are considerable and the high regard in the state for him could offset that
5977267 you would have to concede that having a governor from virginia running on the ticket would be of some help to obama in virginia
5977268 these are traditional voters who tend to favor moderate republican candidates and not ultraconservative republican candidates and i think senator mccain is the type of republican who does very very well out there

5977294 it felt great my first nfl touchdown but its preseason
5977295 last week they were telling me to trust my speed because i made a cutback when i didnt have to
5977296 obviously the kids explosive he makes a lot of plays it can be hard to keep him from being in there
5977297 im trying to win a starting job and trying to go out there and help the defense the best way i can
5977298 l t is the best in the game so it definitely wont be 12 carries but whatever my role is i am just going to go out there and work hard
5977299 hes a good football player and he brings that energy that you want to the football team
5977300 hester he reminds me a little bit of michael turner just for his power being able to run through people
5977301 before i even met him i said hes a football player
5977302 thats the kind of guy you want on your side
5977303 thats what i think of myself just a football player
5977304 its my profession i watch how things are run across the national football league
5977305 each situation is different i cant tell him what he should do or shouldnt do all i can do is wish him well
5977306 they gave me some advice on how to handle things
5977307 we were able to get something worked out im glad i was able to put my ego aside and listen to those guys
5977308 they say if he comes in theres a better opportunity to get something done but its up to him totally up to him hes decided to take the stance hes taken so well see how it goes
5977309 i asked him how he was doing hes doing well
5977310 hes working out and training and getting himself in position so when things happen hell come here and be ready to work were looking forward to getting him back as soon as possible
5977311 you need to be damn near perfect in this league to win a lot of games
5977312 hes just smart he understands the game and has got a lot of confidence hes an undersized guy so he works well in the slot our players just believe in him hes tough as hell and that helps
5977313 i dont know how we can keep him off the field right now to be honest with you
5977314 i had a better grasp of the offense i had a better grasp of what i could do better
5977315 it was just a matter of coming out letting it happen letting loose on the field
5977316 if you play scared or uncomfortable you kind of get exposed in the nfl
5977317 if youre on top of everything you do and play your best a lot of times you shine
5977318 youve got to make sure you dont mess up any routes
5977319 youve got to make plays when the ball is thrown in your direction and that you know all your assignments in the running game
5977320 some receivers are talented enough that they get away with barely having to block the rest of us have to make sure were on top of all our assignments
5977321 when you have a guy who you always know where hes going to be and always know hes going to be in the right spot it allows you to just let the ball go and trust what hes going to do and he always catches it he rarely has a drop
5977322 i guess thats the first step making that opening day roster the first and foremost goal then im just going from there
5977323 its easy to sit there and say well where does he fit in if andres back healthy youve got andre davis and kevin walter
5977324 i was trying to break away from the brazilians they were quite aggressive sometimes bordering on unsportsmanlike this is swimming after all not boxing
5977325 even if youre a superstar it doesnt mean anything when it comes to open water
5977326 for me it was an easy race there was no argy bargy
5977327 im a little bit disappointed about some of the referee decisions made during the set there were three points in a row that he gave to russia the referee called me over and said that our coach would get a yellow card if he continued to talk to the second referee and after i turned around he gave the coach a yellow card
5977328 this gave russia the chance to wake up it was the most important moment of the match

5977611 it was strange i was at home and i barely knew what to do with myself
5977612 before the kid arrived i was always cleaning up the house picking up papers walking around everywhere i was really nervous i guess
5977613 obviously id been in the middle of such craziness and then i go home and its summertime and everythings slowed down summer in montreal everything slows down because its the only two months of nice weather youll have so everyone stops working and id just come off a bunch of crazy touring to this slower environment but i got used to it trust me

5977894 love is sufficient of itself it gives pleasure by itself and because of itself it is its own merit its own reward love looks for no cause outside itself no effect beyond itself its profit lies in its practice i love because i love i love that i may love love is a great thing so long as it continually returns to its fountainhead flows back to its source always drawing from there the water which constantly replenished it of all the movements sensations and feeling of the soul love is the only one in which the creature can respond to the creator and make some sort of similar return however unequal though it be for when god loves all that he desires is to be loved in return the sole purpose for his love is to be loved in the knowledge that those who love him are made happy by their love of him
5977895 the muslim community of the globe today is in the neighborhood of one billion that is an impressive figure but what to me is equally impressive is that islam today is the fastest growing monotheistic religion this is something we have to take into account something is right about islam it is attracting a good many people
5977896 found no favor with luther he regarded the church as the spiritual communion of those who believe in christ he maintained the unity of the church but distinguished two aspects of it the one visible and the other invisible the invisible church becomes visible not by the rule of bishops and cardinals nor in the headship of the pope but by the pure administration of the word and of the sacraments
5977897 consists of the whole number of the elect that have been are or shall be gathered into one under christ the head thereof and is the spouse the body the fullness of him that filleth all in all
5977898 this invisible catholic church hath been sometimes more sometimes less visible and particular churches which are members thereof are more or less pure according as the doctrine of the gospel is taught and embraced ordinances administered and public worship performed more or less purely in them
5977899 if the church exists wherever the word is rightly preached and the sacraments are properly administered who determines whether those things are happening
5977900 and who determines what it is that the holy spirit through the scriptures is saying
5977901 those who gather to hear the word rightly preached and the sacraments properly administered

5977925 i wouldnt argue with the need for such a service but if it isnt fulfilling its design we really need to re evaluate it
5977926 this is an interesting discovery and a lot more important for us because he was dressed in full kit
5977927 we actually find out a lot more about the australians during the first world war by finding bodies such as this one
5977928 the most likely scenario from what we can tell at this stage is that he was part of the attack on messines ridge
5977929 then they were pushing on to further objectives when he was hit and fell and was then covered over by a shell blast or buried in some way and that is where he has lain for 91 years
5977930 we definitely know he wasnt buried by his mates because he was in full battle kit he was still holding his rifle when they uncovered him he had his backpack on he had hand grenades in his pockets and he had all his ammunition and his helmet

5977936 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5977937 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5977938 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5977939 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5977940 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5977941 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5977942 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5977943 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5977944 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5977945 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
5977946 given all these matters i am satisfied that there are special circumstances
5977947 they also support a conclusion that there is no risk of flight

5977960 anything that makes an australian vacation disproportionately expensive is an incentive for tourists domestic or international to go elsewhere
5977961 in 2002 oil was us25 per barrel and the industry fuel bill was us40 billion nobody can predict where the price will go but even a us1 increase adds us1 6 billion to industry costs
5977962 airlines could lose as much as us6 1 billion a7 0 billion this year
5977963 already some 25 airlines in our financial systems have gone bust greater than immediately following september 11 and we are bracing for more
5977964 despite some relief in the oil price we are a fragile industry that is in a crisis

5977979 again this season shows that you should never give up
5977980 there were some races where things didnt go well but for one reason or the other i was able to collect some precious points my position after hungary is better than before the race
5977981 we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently i think that the outcome of the championship will be very tight with ferrari and mclaren very close together in terms of performance and three drivers in a position to win the title
5977982 i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race of the season this is the sole aim the rest is details
5977983 we have to start well at valencia where its more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on
5977984 i hope ill have a trouble free weekend to try to set up the car the best way possible especially for the qualifying lap the qualifying will be extremely important although i think that there are some possibilities on the track to overtake
5977985 if its hot that will help ferrari like at montreal you also need a bit of luck and i hope that it will not end for me as it did in canada

5977988 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
5977989 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
5977990 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
5977991 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilize both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data

5977995 when you finally get to an agent on a phone or a portal you often get a long list of unrelated answers leading to frustrations
5977996 it gives them a story in customer service they have something already but its not as sophisticated as this
5977997 nemertes research has found that companies deploying third party voip focused management tools can reduce per user ip telephony operating costs by as much as 90
5977998 the more fully a tool set can address the complete life cycle of voip in the enterprise the greater the role it can play in such deployments
5977999 our prior integrations of the netflow tracker and visual uptime product lines the recent release of visual performance manager 4 0 and now the purchase of netally combine to give our performance management business the strength in people and product our customers require
5978000 the key idea in power management is quite simple to shut things off when not in use
5978001 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
5978002 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
5978003 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
5978004 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
5978005 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
5978006 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
5978007 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
5978008 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less

5978011 text messaging is really powerful if i have a text message i can forward that text message to over 100 people in my cell phone list
5978012 its going to be read by every single person have you ever not read a text message
5978013 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5978014 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5978015 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
5978016 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
5978017 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
5978018 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5978019 it is now clear the original optimistic ipv6 deployment plans have failed
5978020 with that said throughout the world government mandates are spurring ipv6 adoption
5978021 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
5978022 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
5978023 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there
5978024 you can have a cover band but you cant have a name act
5978025 you can have a string quartet but were not sure you can have a dj
5978026 most people know when they are procrastinating or not getting enough sleep
5978027 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
5978028 technology is a tool to address some of the worlds most pressing challenges related to health care education economic development and the environment
5978029 no nations or individuals are untouched by these issues get involved be part of the solution
5978030 it was a thoughtful piece focusing on what technology can do rather than focusing on 45 nanometer technology
5978031 intel will have plenty of opportunity to talk about products and technology he was trying to raise the level over individual products
5978032 it was certainly crafted to hit some hot button issues
5978033 this is part of a larger recognition and effort by large it vendors that they need to do more to encourage innovation around the world
5978034 sir bob took the call from peaches on a holiday with alan

5978041 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
5978042 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5978043 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5978044 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5978045 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5978046 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5978047 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5978048 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5978049 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
5978050 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
5978051 four years ago we had to make a decision whether to repeat or rebuild
5978052 part of it was due to circumstance and part of it was due to our own estimation
5978053 we decided to go for repeat it came back to bite us on the bum tonight or in the process of the last five days and thats something we have to learn from

5978057 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
5978058 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
5978059 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
5978060 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
5978061 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
5978062 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions

5978070 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5978071 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5978072 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5978073 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5978074 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5978075 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5978076 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5978077 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5978078 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5978079 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5978080 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5978081 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5978082 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5978083 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5978084 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5978085 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5978086 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5978087 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5978088 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5978089 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5978090 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5978091 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5978092 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5978093 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees
5978094 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
5978095 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent
5978096 im of the star wars generation i love science fiction star trek the next generation battlestar galactica love em
5978097 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
5978098 so every time im working on it im really really happy
5978099 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
5978100 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
5978101 but it should be one of his best episodes out of his career too he got to kiss me
5978102 the reason torchwood has gone down so well in america which tv executives should look at is the fact that their audience isnt uptight
5978103 its the executives who are treating the audience like theyre uptight because theyre pandering to programming for one specific audience and forgetting about everyone else out there
5978104 the stories have changed there are stories that people can actually relate to
5978105 a lot of people who argue that the stories are too risque theyre too in your face theyre too heavy for young people theyre afraid of dealing with those situations and theyre afraid of seeing real life on television what were doing is actually what people deal with in their everyday life we just do it in the realm of science fiction
5978106 i like the writers to create the story and create the fantasy for me so that i can then go and try to make it work but if im on set and were doing it and a director will ask me to do something that is completely out of context from what jack would do or what any of them would do we can actually say something
5978107 the producers trust enough and we know the characters well enough that we just know they wouldnt do or say something
5978108 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5978109 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5978110 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5978111 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5978112 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5978113 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5978114 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5978115 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5978116 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5978117 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5978118 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5978119 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5978120 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5978121 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5978122 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5978123 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5978124 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5978125 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5978126 our first priority is to appoint the ad hoc committee to take over administration of the board
5978127 the committee will also probe allegations of corruption and misuse of funds in the pcb
5978128 we will carry out a proper audit of the accounts tally spending and we will fire those people who are found to have misused funds or power
5978129 we may ask ashraf to continue until the end of the champions trophy as we are working at long term plans
5978130 the ad hoc committee will also work to revise the constitution and also recommend name of next chairman
5978131 we set our goals in both forms of the game
5978132 i was really confident in the test series because i really believe in the team that i had
5978133 we had played good test cricket in the lead up to the series and it was one of the series we had targeted
5978134 i had hoped to see the fruits of all our work come through and it did we will always be there or thereabouts in one day cricket but as a word of caution we have lost shaun pollock and charl langeveldt who were two huge role players in our bowling attack
5978135 we have to find two guys to take their place so there will be a reshuffle and it is going to be interesting to see who stands up in the next two weeks
5978136 we havent been able to practise as much death bowling as we would have liked our variations our slower balls our yorkers bouncers which are crucial in one day cricket

5978140 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5978141 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5978142 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5978143 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled

5978149 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5978150 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
5978151 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver

5978177 beliau kata kononnya nak ambil tindakan terhadap pelajar uitm yang sertai demonstrasi tetapi kemudiannya menyerahkan kepada pihak lembaga universiti untuk ambil tindakan sedangkan pihak yang membenarkan serta memberi cuti khas kepada mereka untuk berdemonstrasi adalah pihak pentadbiran uitm sendiri jadi sudah tentulah para pelajar ini tidak akan diambil tindakan tatatertib
5978178 sebaliknya pihak pentadbiran uitm termasuklah naib canselornya sendirilah yang perlu diambil tindakan kerana mengapi apikan para pelajar serta memberikan sokongan dan sponsor kepada mereka untuk berdemonstrasi
5978179 ini merupakan satu lagi bukti bahawa pindaan auku yang mahu dilaksanakan oleh kerajaan hanya bersifat kosmetik semata mata

5978191 when most of us think of a home gym we think of big metal pieces of equipment treadmills and weight machines
5978192 but you dont need that to get a good workout you can get a good workout at home with some simple inexpensive lightweight materials
5978193 you want to think about strength training you need something to add resistance and a body bar is a great tool to do that
5978194 its just a padded bar and it comes in a few different weight ranges

5978198 you hold it in your hands while jumping as if you were jumping rope and it even makes the sound effect of jumping rope but you dont need the rope swinging above your head
5978199 a great way to think when you are building a home gym that you want to be storable is to think are these things i could take with me when i travel

5978226 i want to make sure that in the lead up to the next state election that we actually stamp our style on what we are going to present to the people of queensland versus the style of this government in queensland
5978227 there are a lot of things wrong i mean this government would be happy to leave things the way that they are but were not happy to leave things the way they are
5978228 its our responsibility to be efficient and effective and to make sure that taxpayers dollars are being delivered properly and used properly

5978239 in 2002 oil was us25 per barrel and the industry fuel bill was us40 billion nobody can predict where the price will go but even a us1 increase adds us1 6 billion to industry costs

5978245 its not slowing down responses but unfortunately weve had no such indication from the fire service that theyll do that
5978246 the ban is strictly administrative bans there is no restriction at all on emergency response to the community
5978247 thats what the whole basis of the argument is about we believe that the response to the community has been compromised were certainly not going to do anything to compromise the response to the community
5978248 as with all nature we must evolve or stagnate evolution is but the ebb amp flow of change the give amp take of growth is not part for part we cannot trade ourselves in without denying who we are all that we ever are forms the foundation for who we will be becoming is a journey born of natural selection

5978315 the best way to achieve cost efficient reductions is to put markets to work to that end rather than the regulatory approach said biden
5978316 which bodes well for philadelphias international service and wed like to begin more service to europe and to the middle east and asia in the coming years
5978317 announcing our first service to the middle east is the perfect follow up to our london heathrow service which began in march
5978318 we appreciate us airways commitment to enhancing our citys economy and culture with this new service we look forward to working with us airways to further establish philadelphia as a major international gateway
5978319 you might be wondering why starting tel aviv is any different in an environment where fuel is costly
5978320 china is a developing international market from the united states whereas tel aviv is very established and we absolutely know that our tel aviv service has better economics
5978321 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty
5978322 chefs are trying to be more playful and incorporate new kinds of whimsy
5978323 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted
5978324 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good
5978325 years ago i think food tended to be more traditional and less fun
5978326 its the melding of both these worlds the high end and the low end
5978327 its unfair to compare new jerseys offer with no details attached to this final agreement
5978328 the lease will be a revenue generator for the prpa and were keeping all the vendors together 1 100 people who work there and thousands of truckers who run through there delivering food across the region and as the state of the art facility theyll attract new shipping and vendors that benefits the region and the support community
5978329 international flights have historically been sacrosanct from these kinds of charges
5978330 this is the new era of a fee for every service we should get used to it
5978331 i dont believe well be more than 90 million over in the end i do not think it will be delayed
5978332 im afraid that with the price of steel and all the things that go into construction the bids will blow by that
5978333 if it gets to a point where we cant afford it weve simply got to pull the plug on it
5978334 if the bids come in and are way over it does not appear to me we can go forward
5978335 i cant answer why he rendell said what he said at the end of the day there will be a convention center expansion there will be casinos built theres too much invested for this not to happen
5978336 i dont know why the governor said what he said it will be a tremendous benefit to the city the region and the state it is my expectation that the project will move forward the building will get built and we will have a spectacular convention center expansion
5978337 everything is much more expensive than it used to be steel is noticeably in the forefront of that
5978338 a lot of owners both public and private are rethinking their projects
5978339 part of it is the chinese buying so much part of it is a slowdown of the auto manufacturers not producing as much scrap
5978340 we couldnt get much more than 790 million from the state and the city combined thats no 1 where can we find the money
5978341 my job is to get this thing done and we are going to get it done
5978342 mayor nutter is 1 000 percent for it hes not going to let this fall through the cracks not when you are looking a gift horse in the mouth of 700 million
5978343 since these estimates have a small margin of error are leading indicators of future housing activity and are not influenced by weather nearly as much as starts
5978344 but they also hint at a possible rebound late this year
5978345 starts will continue to fall through the end of the year likely hitting a 50 year low
5978346 the good news is that the lower construction will soon cut into the mountain of inventory weighing on the housing market
5978347 the real issue is not what the one month low will be but when will activity simply stabilize
5978348 there are no frosty relations at all within the government
5978349 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
5978350 we all had some bad news today our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
5978351 we dont expect to recover additional money in the near term as a result of this order
5978352 we are making efforts to have him returned to the united states
5978353 any toll increase or gasoline tax will only be for transportation
5978354 i dont think were going to do any debt reduction for a while
5978355 considering all options as we work to consider a funding solution for transportation
5978356 its not a popular issue these days why do you think politicians in the past like whitman and mcgreevey increased the debt because the public doesnt care about it
5978357 not a herculean step were not claiming weve solved every problem the idea is that we make these kinds of choices on a regular basis about how we budget and manage our finances we will get ourselves back into a strong position
5978358 each day you get closer to election day 2009 it makes it tougher and tougher to deal with these complicated issues

5978360 le peuple dabkhazie a lintention de demander la direction russe de reconna tre labkhazie
5978361 this shows that the government cannot be trusted to protect peoples personal details
5978362 ministers should think again about its even more risky and intrusive projects such as the identity card database the all encompassing childrens database and the property database for the council tax revaluation
5978363 tougher safeguards are needed to protect the privacy of law abiding citizens from the government
5978364 sometimes you are going to get burned thats what happens
5978365 99 percent of what we do here is wonderful and only a little is not

5978382 the first pocket sized music system good enough for audio purists
5978383 foxl is a direct result of our founder dr godehard guenther having traveled extensively over the last few years
5978384 one thing he noticed is that there are no audiophile grade portable speaker options for travelers who want to enjoy music while on the road
5978385 conventional wisdom dictates that full range sonics are not possible from a console the size of a candy bar but dr guenther believes that deviation from the norm is essential to creative and successful product development
5978386 with foxl he knows that he isnt the only music lover who would appreciate better sound in hotel rooms or other limited space environments simply put he designed a portable speaker that he himself had wanted

5978400 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
5978401 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
5978402 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
5978403 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun
5978404 we want to deliver something truly impressive for visitors to the games convention this year and with midways most diverse and powerful line up yet plus our unique show format we feel we will offer an amazing experience for everyone

5978433 there is still negative rating pressure this is coming from structural issues and increasingly from cyclical issues
5978434 when we look at the variables that are driving the sector we cannot really come up with any positive driver on its own that could have an overall positive impact on the financial performance of the sector
5978435 we are probably about to enter a period of cyclical weakness which comes on top of the structural issues that would mean downside or negative pressure for the industry if we look at the next 12 to 24 months

5978437 we would make the point that while its a tough financial environment right now we remain confident and committed to this project
5978438 were aware of the stories going around and were watching it very carefully
5978439 the financing climate is extremely difficult right now but a project with such a strong mixed use component will unequivocally be viable from a financing standpoint and i would say sooner rather than later

5978488 das unbehagen das vor allem der westen bei dieser wendung der weltgeschichte zu empfinden scheint beruht auf der ungewissheit die der aufstieg eines solch m chtigen landes wie china f r die zukunft bringen wird der westen erblickt in china die kommende konkurrenz gegen ber korea dem politischen zwerg konnte man nachsichtig und aufmunternd sein

5978502 this book has been written with some exotic scenes in it
5978503 the best system for picking a chief executive suited to a nation like ours a geographically large ideologically diverse socially complex federal republic
5978504 i can only go by the polls which show mccain winning the state handily
5978505 if senator mccain is truly getting such a large percentage of the jewish vote its probably an indicator that heavily democrat areas of florida will not hold up for senator obama and will cause obama to lose the state
5978506 a person of principle who has a great record of supporting israel
5978507 understands that israel is our strong ally and is committed to protecting the jewish state
5978508 obama has vowed to meet with iranian leaders who have called israel names that i prefer not to repeat
5978509 veterans understand that mccain has been in their position before
5978510 the country first mentality is a common factor for many vets and military and they know that mccain has the experience needed
5978511 obama has stated on several occasions that he would meet with leaders such as fidel castro without preconditions many latinos are noticing what is happening with leaders such as chavez or evo morales and they oppose obamas plans and can see that he does not have the experience needed to deal with latin america
5978512 the situation in congress demonstrates the lack of interest for the environment and our energy crisis and people are becoming more aware of what is happening
5978513 the american people deserve a commander in chief who puts their country first ahead of party politics and self interest senator obama is slowly revealing himself to americans and many do not like what they see
5978514 in ohio kitchen table issues are dominant ohio has lost 250 000 manufacturing jobs to places like china and mexico due to the failed bush economic policies that john mccain promises to continue
5978515 there isnt an attack ad in the book that can save john mccain if ohio voters walk into the voting booth thinking about their jobs their mortgages their gas tanks or their grocery bills
5978516 jobs have disappeared abroad mainly because unions require 35 per hour salaries with pensions and vacations for 55 year olds who watch machines all day and take long lunches think that flies in beijing
5978517 the democrats cannot use gas prices and heating bills as reasons veterans will discount john mccain who has spent nearly his entire life in service to his country
5978518 words like duty honor and country belong in a much more powerful context to men who have fought for our freedom
5978519 it is almost entirely due to the northern virginia area the only area thats truly liberal
5978520 say they will vote for obama but these same people will condemn obama amongst their friends so the polls might not be as accurate as we think
5978521 in every single presidential election ive observed the democratic candidate has always had a significant lead over the republican candidate
5978522 in the home state of john ashcroft where a republican governor has
5978523 to win here you must appeal to both the metro and rural voter this is why missouri is a bell weather
5978524 farmers will be watching for the candidate who will extend his hand to help them they cannot be overlooked
5978525 iowans especially farmers can spot fakes be honest or be gone
5978526 being a middle american seeing someone who isnt even officially the candidate acting like hes already won the election is a major turn off because it comes off as arrogant and presumptuous
5978527 iowans expect our leaders to be humble and accountable not a rock star
5978528 independent voters are beginning to hop off the obama bandwagon as they learn more about his liberal voting record and recognize his lack of experience
5978529 groups that i do see as potential pickups for john mccain are women and reagan democrats
5978530 john mccains bipartisan immigration plan has been well received by many in the latino community evidenced by mccains dominance in winning the votes of latino republicans during the primary and caucus season
5978531 most of the eastern border of the state is conservative as well especially down in the southeast quadrant of the state where it is rural in the west texas sense very conservative small towns with lots of oil and that love high school football
5978532 the latino hispanic mexican american vote is largely democratic by registration and geography
5978533 while heavily hispanic counties voted for clinton during the 2008 presidential preference caucus the obama campaign is running a robust hispanic outreach program
5978534 the native american community in new mexico is heavily registered as democrats
5978535 these communities will definitely play an important role in turning new mexico blue this fall
5978536 there are a large number of independent voters in albuquerque and las cruces and sen mccain has a proven ability to connect these voters
5978537 he also has great appeal to native americans and we therefore expect him to perform better with the navajo nation and among new mexico s pueblo indian population
5978538 conservative democrats appreciate senator mccains willingness and ability to reach across the aisle a skill obama has never shown which reinforces his status as an unknown and incredibly inexperienced presidential candidate
5978539 mccain is willing to explore all options to create a comprehensive and successful energy plan for america barack obama on the other hand continues to simply say no to common sense energy solutions that could reduce gas prices now and reduce our dependence on foreign oil
5978540 voters in new mexico share the same concerns as small business owners families of servicemen and women in iraq or as commuters having a hard time paying for higher gas prices
5978541 barack obama is a candidate who will prioritize the concerns of working class families
5978542 voters who honor the life of the unborn and support traditional marriage will support senator mccain in large numbers
5978543 obama as with so many issues shows his incredibly liberal viewpoint on social issues that are so important to voters with a strong faith while a state senator he voted against allowing medical care to babies who survive an abortion procedure its hard to get farther left than that
5978544 many of those who populate the suburban towns around manchester and nashua left the state of massachusetts because they felt alienated by that states politics
5978545 but for the past two years new hampshire residents have lived under a democratic majority in the state legislature and the sky has not fallen
5978546 i do not think veterans are monolithic or that their votes hinge on issues involving the military or the war
5978547 new hampshire has relatively low church attendance and our evangelicals tend to be yankees that is more private about their faith than evangelicals in other parts of the country
5978548 mike huckabee only got 11 of the primary vote here
5978549 mccain has been here four times since winning the primary which speaks to his understanding of us a swing state
5978550 whilst many communities have responded with remarkable speed and confidence this has neither been matched by assembly government funding or mainstream programme bending to assist them achieve regeneration of their communities
5978551 hes been relentlessly hounded by the media on the streets so he decided to push back

5978786 mr dion has indicated that the government should be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
5978787 polls do indicate that the next election is in all likelihood a minority one way or the other
5978788 the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government a government needs a new mandate
5978789 they have no intention of respecting the fixed election date
5978790 so i think obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding

5978794 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
5978795 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
5978796 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
5978797 and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way
5978798 the significant military assistance provided by israel to georgia in its war against russia will affect in the future and probably in the near future ties between russia and israel and russias attitude toward arab states
5978799 russia will re examine its ties with israel and it is not unlikely that moscow will now decide to increase its military assistance to arab countries in conflict with israel including syria
5978800 there is a real concern among journalists about where the next generation is coming from and how it will learn journalistic ethics
5978801 these are young people who are growing up in a really different media climate thats much more dominated by opinion journalism and blogging and talk radio
5978802 i think that the opportunity to jump into our field and get going as early as possible is just phenomenal

5978807 defensively we still have to improve but thats normal when you only have one day of preparation
5978808 not at all you have the organisation that was not good yet but we had one training session
5978809 we have 10 days to work before uzbekistan and thats what we have to improve definitely
5978810 the movement was excellent and overall some of the boys look really sharp
5978811 the way we try to play when weve got the ball means if we lose it were quite spread out and we have to get back into position as quickly as possible or we leave ourselves vulnerable
5978812 me and scotty do alright together i think with more time on the pitch together it will get even better
5978813 marks definitely a quality player i look up to him and can still learn a lot from him
5978814 i know what they can do and what they cant
5978815 i will wait until training camp when i have everyone in the group then i can make my mind up
5978816 mark has always had an amazing will to win and a great depth of character
5978817 hes always had the ability to play well in big matches and do big jobs on the best small forwards going round but then be able to go forward and kick goals
5978818 i dont think scott prince is a liability at any stage hes a great footballer who has shown great courage
5978819 princey was prepared to break his arm for us last weekend and that gives you strength and determination to dig deep
5978820 it makes you think youre not going too bad when youve got a guy in your team with a crack in his arm whos prepared to keep turning up for you
5978821 you do your best but these days theres not many places to hide out there
5978822 the cowboys found him a couple of times on the weekend and princey made his tackles
5978823 hell get a lot of confidence out of last weeks game in terms of putting his body in front of people and im sure hes prepared to do it again
5978824 we like to think whether it be princey or anyone else we are there to cover up any mishaps we have and we take that philosophy into the game
5978825 we know what were going to get out of scott and hopefully he knows what he is going to get out of us
5978826 it says a lot about scott he would do that
5978827 its not only what he does on the field its what he brings to our whole dynamics
5978828 playing in the fifa world cup is an ambition shared by the entire nation and were looking forward to a full house and vocal support from queenslanders to help the players on the journey to south africa

5978834 for us weve just moved on from it a few weeks ago so we just want to train and do our thing and thats all well worry about
5978835 obviously the guys coming in theres some great signings there and weve got a lot of young kids coming in as well who are outstanding talents and weve seen a few of them in first grade this year
5978836 the futures looking good but for us the playing group and the coach we want to finish 2008 on a good note
5978837 certainly theres not many players available now and theres certainly no other sonny bill williams floating around
5978838 the address is http shinbikkuri3 wordpress com can you remember that
5978839 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move
5978840 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5978841 we are probably at a position where it is not possible to have a world class event elsewhere the shorter time frame the less likely that is of happening
5978842 i think the time for switching to another host country has passed
5978843 its a complicated legal process its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
5978844 if not it will come down to a decision from the players
5978845 our position is that we cant recommend that our players should tour pakistan

5978850 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5978851 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5978852 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said
5978853 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5978854 i thought it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have on mr rudd

5978871 the basic rule is that in a court case whether it is bankruptcy or another case we dont want people always running off to the appellate court
5978872 in order to appeal typically the law requires there be a final order or a final judgment in the case
5978873 all the bankruptcy court has done is prescribe the procedures it chooses to follow in selecting competing plans
5978874 no plan has been approved and no bid has been accepted
5978875 the district court can either do a ton of work on the finality question and on the merits of the case and take the appeal or it can do very little work and find its not final
5978876 if this one isnt appealed the parent might have to wait until theres an order approving the sale to sterlite put up a multi billion dollar bond in order to appeal and as a practical matter the case could be finished

5978924 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates

5978984 we are committed to accelerating this and to do this we are narrowing the gap in educational achievement between children from deprived backgrounds and those who are better off
5978985 these figures show results in london are now higher than the national average following years of under performance this shows our investment in deprived inner city areas is paying off and we are committed to replicating this success in other parts of the country
5978986 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
5978987 valuable because not everyone sits in front of a computer or a television
5978988 at getting votes on election day and communicating the messages that we feel are important to our supporters
5978989 text messaging is really powerful if i have a text message i can forward that text message to over 100 people in my cell phone list
5978990 its going to be read by every single person have you ever not read a text message
5978991 were still sort of at the beginning of figuring out what you can do with the text messaging
5978992 we are going to tbilisi warsaw and kyiv to meet with the leaders of these important american allies and to discuss the russian invasion of georgia
5978993 this is a moment in history when it is vital for the worlds democracies to stand in solidarity
5978994 in dealing with russia even a large minority of democrats think mccain would do better than obama
5978995 well have to see how important this issue becomes in the fall campaign
5978996 it certainly ought to tell him to pick a vice president with foreign policy experience
5978997 a significant share of the republican base loves to talk of joe as their favorite democrat but they do not want him to be a heartbeat away from the presidency
5978998 retailers are mature enough in this industry that they understand that consumers will visit their web sites before they ever visit the store
5978999 ninety percent of consumers go online to research before they buy that makes it even more important to have your brand replicated online because millions of people a day can come and check out your web site
5979000 were probably better friends today after two ventures than we were as kids thats pretty rare
5979001 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
5979002 with all due respect and i know the other folks in consideration theyre a wonderful group but theyre not really all that close
5979003 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
5979004 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
5979005 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
5979006 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
5979007 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
5979008 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
5979009 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
5979010 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
5979011 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
5979012 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
5979013 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
5979014 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
5979015 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
5979016 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
5979017 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
5979018 am visat c o s o bat c ndva pe ryoko am nvins o azi n cea mai important zi care a devenit i cea mai important zi din via a mea
5979019 co jste d lal 21 srpna 1968 jak na v s okupace zap sobila jak v s ovlivnila
5979020 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5979021 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5979022 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5979023 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5979024 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5979025 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5979026 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5979027 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5979028 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5979029 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5979030 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5979031 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5979032 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5979033 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5979034 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5979035 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5979036 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
5979037 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
5979038 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
5979039 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
5979040 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
5979041 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
5979042 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
5979043 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
5979044 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
5979045 seemed to be a step backwards towards confusion rather than a progress towards resolution
5979046 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
5979047 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
5979048 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
5979049 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
5979050 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
5979051 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
5979052 it makes my eyes roll into the back of my head
5979053 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5979054 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5979055 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5979056 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5979057 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5979058 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5979059 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5979060 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5979061 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5979062 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5979063 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5979064 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5979065 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5979066 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5979067 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5979068 well no but you have to ask yourself what it means
5979069 president elect mccain will be making a very big mistake by appointing joe leiberman as his vp
5979070 you ever notice how anyone who stands between them and power is an evil idiot bent on the destruction of the world funny how that works
5979071 actually the far right often accuses chavez not only of wanting to take over south america but often insinuate that hes working with iran to install nukes the far right often accuses syria of attacking us interests granted considering israel is our 51st state thats not unexpected as for mugabe the far right has been rather silent i guess its more important to pretend that were all georgians than to take an actual stand on mugabes horrific abuses
5979072 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
5979073 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
5979074 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
5979075 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
5979076 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
5979077 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
5979078 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
5979079 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
5979080 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
5979081 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
5979082 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
5979083 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
5979084 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
5979085 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
5979086 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
5979087 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
5979088 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5979089 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5979090 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5979091 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5979092 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5979093 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5979094 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5979095 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5979096 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5979097 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5979098 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5979099 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5979100 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5979101 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5979102 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5979103 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5979104 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5979105 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5979106 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5979107 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5979108 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5979109 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5979110 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5979111 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
5979112 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
5979113 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
5979114 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
5979115 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5979116 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5979117 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5979118 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5979119 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5979120 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5979121 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5979122 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5979123 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5979124 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5979125 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5979126 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5979127 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5979128 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5979129 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
5979130 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
5979131 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5979132 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5979133 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5979134 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5979135 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5979136 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5979137 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5979138 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5979139 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5979140 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5979141 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
5979142 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5979143 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5979144 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5979145 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5979146 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5979147 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5979148 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5979149 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5979150 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5979151 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5979152 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5979153 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5979154 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5979155 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5979156 by addressing the connection between the health of our children and the health of the environment we strive to make a difference for both
5979157 to that end naturalpath media is the perfect partner for bringing relevant advertising and sponsorship support that aligns with our values and community at drgreene com
5979158 were thrilled to partner with drgreene com the most trusted online source for childrens health and the leading online community of parents seeking to raise their children in healthy and sustainable households
5979159 dr greene who has been called the al gore of pediatrics has created a thriving community of parents seeking to educate themselves on health and parenting issues to make better choices for their children his advice combines practical wisdom warm empathy a deep respect for parents children and the environment and will provide our marketing partners with the premium online brand for childrens health and parenting the combination of drgreene com and our other moms and family channel sites gives us a targeted highly effective way to engage this affluent and influential audience
5979160 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5979161 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5979162 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5979163 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5979164 they did it to massachusetts sen john kerry they did it to former vice president al gore they tried to do it to former president clinton they did it to former massachusetts gov michael dukakis
5979165 thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern they know how to run a negative campaign
5979166 in order for us to win we not only have to beat the attack machine weve got to win back the trust of the american people
5979167 the same guys that brought you george bush are now trying to bring you john mccain theyve basically got the same strategy which is they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is theyre going to try to attack me
5979168 this may not be directly affiliated with the campaign but you know suddenly magically you got the same guy who wrote unfit for command
5979169 he comes out with a new book saying that im a nut
5979170 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
5979171 unless you are in the top one tenth of 1 in this country you are not better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago
5979172 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
5979173 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5979174 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5979175 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5979176 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5979177 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5979178 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5979179 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5979180 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5979181 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5979182 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5979183 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5979184 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5979185 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5979186 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5979187 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5979188 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5979189 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5979190 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5979191 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5979192 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5979193 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5979194 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5979195 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5979196 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5979197 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5979198 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5979199 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
5979200 if sen barack obama should choose hillary clinton i will stay home on election day and i am not alone
5979201 theres a sucker born every minute and they are all hillary supporters
5979202 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5979203 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5979204 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5979205 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5979206 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5979207 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5979208 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5979209 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
5979210 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
5979211 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
5979212 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
5979213 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
5979214 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
5979215 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
5979216 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
5979217 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5979218 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5979219 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5979220 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5979221 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5979222 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
5979223 this is veep week that in reality is about all that anyone outside sen barack obamas inner inner circle knows
5979224 unless its al gore or john kerry or santa claus
5979225 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
5979226 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
5979227 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
5979228 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
5979229 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
5979230 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
5979231 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
5979232 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5979233 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5979234 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5979235 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5979236 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5979237 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5979238 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5979239 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
5979240 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
5979241 what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
5979242 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5979243 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5979244 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5979245 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5979246 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5979247 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5979248 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5979249 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
5979250 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
5979251 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
5979252 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
5979253 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
5979254 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
5979255 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
5979256 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
5979257 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5979258 at the end of the day no sentence will make up for what has happened to my husband
5979259 unfortunately for robert gentry at about this time he was leaving his home to go to work
5979260 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5979261 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5979262 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5979263 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5979264 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5979265 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5979266 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5979267 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5979268 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5979269 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5979270 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5979271 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5979272 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5979273 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5979274 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5979275 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5979276 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5979277 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5979278 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5979279 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5979280 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5979281 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5979282 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5979283 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5979284 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5979285 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5979286 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5979287 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5979288 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5979289 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5979290 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5979291 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5979292 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5979293 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5979294 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5979295 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5979296 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5979297 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5979298 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5979299 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5979300 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5979301 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5979302 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5979303 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5979304 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5979305 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5979306 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5979307 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5979308 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5979309 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5979310 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5979311 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

5979314 while airlines have been good at limiting our emissions with constant efficiency improvements carbon intense industries with less impressive records are given breaks that airlines are not
5979315 the productivity commission recognised the need to maintain a level playing field for footloose industries
5979316 anything that makes an australian vacation disproportionately expensive is an incentive for tourists domestic or international to go elsewhere
5979317 in 2002 oil was us25 per barrel and the industry fuel bill was us40 billion nobody can predict where the price will go but even a us1 increase adds us1 6 billion to industry costs
5979318 airlines could lose as much as us6 1 billion a7 0 billion this year
5979319 already some 25 airlines in our financial systems have gone bust greater than immediately following september 11 and we are bracing for more
5979320 despite some relief in the oil price we are a fragile industry that is in a crisis
5979321 the approach is blunt and focused only on economic measures
5979322 mckesson makes its own decisions about numbers of counsellors available at any point in time

5979394 and i think that shows the governments credibility in ensuring the impact of this plant is minimised
5979395 every time we make a commitment to build something like this that increases emissions we are going a step backwards

5979426 the situation here on ground is that essential commodities have started getting dried up diesel is already out of stock and petrol at its verge of end the people here are very much concerned as if the same continues for next few days there will be nothing left to eat with the people of kashmir and on the other side the army is supporting the mobs who have allegedly beaten up the drivers stranded on the national highway the drivers who were beaten up reported that they asked army to help them but all went in despair and the army people in return handed them over to the mobs the target is only the kashmiri muslims and some sources from jammu say that it is the outsiders who have come to jammu and are doing such attacks on the muslims and it is quite evident that the hindu fundamentalist groups viz bjp rss vhp etc are all sponsoring the planned attacks onto the kashmiris like it was done in gujarat here in kashmir we feel the history seems to be being repeated by the hindu fundamentalists who had earlier in 1947 killed about 250 000 muslims in jammu

5979606 i think the formal process kicked off yesterday with the establishment of a nato georgia commission and we have taken seriously the commitments the heads of government made in april
5979607 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
5979608 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military that means helping the georgians build up their capacity
5979609 it means building up proper interoperability with nato proper joint training it also means ensuring the structures of cooperation are properly geared towards eventual membership so this is a route map to membership
5979610 ten years people were saying how could these countries be members of nato
5979611 they are independent countries they are not ex soviet union they are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make their own decisions on the basis of their own popular will
5979612 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture of the international landscape not just as an accident

5979630 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
5979631 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
5979632 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
5979633 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
5979634 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
5979635 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
5979636 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations

5979638 this is a good move for intel and its good for customers that intel is making the move
5979639 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
5979640 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
5979641 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilise both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data

5979657 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5979658 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate

5979660 of alcoholism was thought to be progressive it moved from psychological to physiological dependence and irreversible the alcoholic could never safely return to normal drinking the only effective treatment according to the a
5979661 virtually every book or pamphlet lay or professional published in the last 25 years on the manifestations of alcoholism has presented the jellinekian phases as unchallenged fact
5979662 the most comprehensive and clear cut ordering of characteristic experiences of alcoholics
5979663 how the beliefs of people about alcohol and alcohol consumers influence the assumptions about etiology
5979664 has been the standard textbook description of the alcoholism process it has essentially gone unchallenged until recently
5979665 well along in the course of alcoholism rather than at an early stage
5979666 despite jellineks regard for the right of the individual drinker his conceptions appear to have been subtly influenced by the protestant ethic his phases of alcohol addiction with its orderly and inferentially irreversible progression of malign symptoms through the prealcoholic phase the prodromal phase the crucial phase and finally the chronic stage is of a piece with hogarths famous illustration of a drunkards progress on the downward path to perdition while jellinek does not say that the phases of alcohol addiction always occur in the same order his vivid descriptions of the progress of alcoholism are so well attuned to the values of the middle class western physician and welfare worker that his cautions are largely overlooked by those who apply his conceptions and by the many writers who repeat his early concepts
5979667 every major tenet of the disease view of addiction is refuted by both research and everyday observation
5979668 theres no such thing as a genetic cause of alcoholism
5979669 the best predictors of alcoholism are all psychosocial factors who you hang out with whether you have a job the whole genetic argument is misguided and unjustified

5979671 so is this like you thought is it the same as in america

5979673 pascal was ist der schl ssel zur vorbereitung auf eine noch unbekannte neue strecke wie valencia
5979674 wir bereiten uns im wesentlichen so vor wie wir das bei einer neuen strecke immer tun wir beginnen mit den informationen die wir von der fia erhalten und stellen einige geschwindigkeitsprofile auf dieses mal stehen auch zus tzliche informationen zur verf gung weil dort vor dem grand prix schon ein rennen f r formel 3 und gt autos stattgefunden hat das gab uns die gelegenheit selbst informationen zu sammeln einige von unseren leuten haben sich die logistik angesehen und technische daten zu den fahrlinien eingeholt wir sind dieses mal also vermutlich besser vorbereitet als bei anderen neuen strecken
5979675 f r einen stra enkurs sind die auslaufzonen und die breite der fahrbahn beeindruckend die strecke ist sehr sehr breit und auch einigerma en schnell wir erwarten dass sie im mittelhohen abtriebsniveau liegt und ziemlich stark die bremsen beansprucht der grip d rfte anfangs ziemlich gering sein wird im laufe des wochenendes aber besser werden das abtriebsniveau unterscheidet sich von ungarn erheblich weil die durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit relativ hoch ist weshalb sich alle um weniger abtrieb bem hen werden wobei aber zu beachten ist dass der grip ziemlich niedrig zu sein scheint
5979676 einige formel 3 fahrer meinten dass die kerbs ein problem sein k nnten gibt es etwas was dir sorgen macht
5979677 solche details geh ren zu den dingen die wir vor dem grand prix wochenende noch aufgreifen werden uns macht vor allem die schwenkbr cke sorgen da sie normalerweise gedreht werden muss um die boote in den hafen zu lassen ist ein 3 zentimeter breiter und einige millimeter hoher spalt vorhanden es scheint dass es in der formel 3 einige schwierigkeiten damit gegeben hat weshalb wir die situation sehr genau beobachten werden
5979678 wie wichtig ist der fahrbahnbelag in bezug auf die eingesetzten reifen
5979679 extrem wichtig die reifenauswahl liegt fest der belag gibt aber den ausschlag daf r ob wir unter den gestellten bridgestone reifen prim r die weichen oder die superweichen reifen einsetzen er beeinflusst auch das abtriebsniveau
5979680 kommt dem freien training am freitag deshalb in valencia eine zus tzliche bedeutung zu
5979681 man kann wohl erwarten dass viel gefahren wird aber nicht so sehr zu beginn der sitzung weil die strecke da noch staubig ist sicher ist aber dass wir noch viele daten einzufahren haben und es werden wohl erheblich mehr runden gefahren als auf einer strecke die schon gut bekannt ist
5979682 genie t du die herausforderung ein rennen auf einem neuen kurs zu fahren
5979683 es ist immer eine zus tzliche herausforderung wenn man keine referenzdaten hat und man muss mehr dar ber nachdenken was vergleichbar ist es ist schon interessanter wenn man versuchen muss schneller als die konkurrenz die leistungsbestimmenden faktoren herauszufinden es wird ein sehr arbeitsreiches wochenende und es kann sein dass es logistisch etwas eng wird weil dies eine neue situation ist ich glaube aber dass wir am ende alles auf der reihe haben
5979684 was war deine reaktion auf timo glocks zweiten platz in ungarn
5979685 es versteht sich dass wir mit unserer leistung in ungarn sehr zufrieden waren unsere pace war wirklich gut besonders bei timo der vom zweiten platz einmal abgesehen auch im qualifying um einen der ersten drei pl tze gek mpft hat
5979686 seine erste rundenzeit im q3 war sogar die zweitbeste der ganzen session wenn man die spritlasten ber cksichtigt nur hamilton war besser der f nfte startplatz war sein bisher bestes qualifyingergebnis und f r das team in bezug auf die pace insgesamt vielleicht sogar das beste der ganzen saison timos rennen war ebenfalls hervorragend und er lag performancem ig sehr nahe am mclaren von kovalainen weshalb er den platz auf dem podest voll verdient hat
5979687 hast du nach den erfahrungen der ersten saisonh lfte den eindruck dass timo st rker geworden ist
5979688 er wird immer besser sowohl im qualifying als auch im rennen und sieht sehr viel versprechend aus er ist in dieser saison schon mehrere male stark gewesen und hat besonders in hockenheim eine hervorragende pace gezeigt budapest war also kein einzelfall es ist offensichtlich dass timo seine lernphase allm hlich abzuschlie en scheint jarno trulli anm d red hat im ungarn vergleich vielleicht einige zehntel zur ck gelegen er war aber mit seinem setup nicht ganz zufrieden hatte im qualifying eine gr ere spritlast und fuhr mit seinem motor das zweite rennen w hrend der von timo noch neu war in budapest waren also beide autos sehr konkurrenzf hig was sehr gut f r das team ist
5979689 glaubst du dass ihr nach den zehn punkten von ungarn den vierten rang in der konstrukteurswertung ber den rest der saison halten k nnt
5979690 das ist unsere zielsetzung und nach den letzten vier rennen ist das auch der rang den wir verdienen aber in der formel 1 wei man nie was als n chstes kommt und wir untersch tzen auf keinen fall was andere teams wie renault und red bull leisten k nnen wenn man einmal die performance seit magny cours zugrunde legt glaube ich dass wir den kampf mit bmw um das drittschnellste paket aufnehmen k nnen valencia wird auch zeigen wie gut die teams in der lage sind auf neue bedingungen zu reagieren und vorherzusehen was die leistungsbestimmenden faktoren sind es wird interessant werden
5979691 ich selber habe fr her zu hause vor dem fernseher mit den kandidaten mitgefiebert jetzt freue ich mich nat rlich umso mehr diese tolle actionreiche show moderieren zu d rfen vor allem bin ich gespannt wie sich die kandidaten bei den beiden spiele klassikern der wassertank und der hei e draht schlagen werden

5979701 we may have hit a top for the dollar i dont think this rally can last
5979702 i can definitely see gabby and ashley breaking into the england side this season they can be as good as they want
5979703 they have great potential they have everything in front of them they are both young with fantastic skills and they can both succeed and go a long way in the game
5979704 it is the start of a new era for england and there is a good generation of players coming through i think they will be very strong in the years to come and gabby and ashley can be part of that
5979705 the good thing is the players want to learn gabby has improved so much in just my time here since january 2007 and i am sure he will continue to get even better
5979706 he can be as good as he wants to be and there is definitely more to come from him i also think all the young players at
5979707 i think the formal process kicked off yesterday with the establishment of a nato georgia commission and we have taken seriously the commitments the heads of government made in april
5979708 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
5979709 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military that means helping the georgians build up their capacity
5979710 it means building up proper interoperability with nato proper joint training it also means ensuring the structures of cooperation are properly geared towards eventual membership so this is a route map to membership
5979711 ten years people were saying how could these countries be members of nato
5979712 they are independent countries they are not ex soviet union they are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make their own decisions on the basis of their own popular will
5979713 i think its right to see georgian and ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture of the international landscape not just as an accident
5979714 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house

5979722 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
5979723 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously

5979811 sympathetic consciousness of others distress together with a desire to alleviate it
5979812 musharrafs participation in the war on terror and the cooperation of the intelligence agency with the united states were to put it mildly never popular in the country moreover he was only ever half hearted in his fight against the militant islamists sometimes ruthless sometimes conciliatory the coalition government is strategically unsure of itself and seems to want to secure an end to domestic terror through deals something that the increasingly bold islamists wont thank them for but will simply use to increase the areas they control in light of this situation the west in general and the us in particular must do more about pakistan than before it must prevent the nuclear nightmare of islamists gaining access to atomic weapons
5979813 it needs to become clear to the pakistani leadership that when they take on militant islamists they are not just doing the west a favor they are also helping to develop their own country the belief that the fall of the kabul government and the return of the taliban would be a strategic victory over india is a fantasy from previous centuries allowing islamism to flourish politically militarily socially and ideologically cannot be in the interests of most pakistanis their interests lie in achieving economic stability and the west can do more here too
5979814 the west should take the opportunity of musharrafs resignation to encourage a policy in islamabad that combines international dependability with development and democracy the preconditions for long term stability
5979815 the assessment of the american intelligence agencies is that the risk of an islamist take over is very low the us government never saw the promotion of democracy in pakistan as the main task washington depended on the army to keep the country under control ashfaq kayani the new us trained head of the army since january has musharraf to thank for his career he first made him head of the isi intelligence agency and then his successor as the head of the army he now determines the scope within which the parties and democracy can operate
5979816 nevertheless with musharraf going a scapegoat is disappearing from the stage one whom afghan president hamid karzai and when required the americans could blame everything on they could claim that pakistan and musharraf in particular were responsible for the instable situation in afghanistan and the resurgence of the taliban more
5979817 karzai and his backers will soon need a replacement for musharraf his resignation does not mean that the pakistan army will go on the offensive against the pashtun tribes in the border regions the problems there anyway cannot be solved by military means they can only be fixed with dialogue and development aid
5979818 in addition the pakistanis civilians and soldiers have no interest in a stable afghanistan in which its archenemy india is increasing its influence encouraged by karzai every conflict in this region that pakistan is involved in has to be seen through the prism of its enmity toward india
5979819 musharraf had a vision he wanted to put his country on the path toward the turkish secular model and saw himself as the pakistani atat rk however the dream of a secular pakistan is probably dead
5979820 he failed because of the countrys poverty the fatally high birth rate the boom in the price of natural resources the divide between the islamists and the secular part of society the politicians ambition and his inability as president to find a consensus across the board and to step down at the right time by the time he took off his uniform his second skin it was already too late
5979821 pakistan is more important than it seems a nuclear armed state not tied in to arms control with conflicts on both sides fragile internally on the new frontline between the east and the west pakistan after musharraf is the cause for much worry in global politics
5979822 the fact that the dictator is finally stepping down presents pakistan with a unique opportunity now the democratic structures can grow in those regions and parts of society that had been left in a vacuum by repeated dictatorships and it is only in these political vacuums that fanaticism can take hold
5979823 pakistan is now facing a period of political instability perhaps even a period of chaos on the streets it is doubtful if the divided coalition which was so busy in its efforts to have the president impeached that it forgot about the really urgent problems facing the country will now be able to find the necessary unity to prevent a power struggle pakistan is ill prepared for life after musharraf
5979824 the fight against the taliban must be taken as seriously as reviving the economy it is only if pakistans government and future president apply themselves to solving these problems and manage to fight against corruption and inefficiency that the country can free itself from the vacuum that is looming and achieve a fresh political start
5979825 the west absolutely has to contribute to this musharrafs close ties to the us may not have pleased many people in the country however without the americans help the country would have been left helplessly in the grasp of the islamists the best thing the us administration could do now is to use its influence to make sure that democracy in pakistan is not smashed in a power struggle pakistans nuclear arsenal must never be allowed to fall into the hands of extremists
5979826 the developments in pakistan affect important western interests one is the question of what policy the country will pursue with regards to the taliban which is launching its war in neighboring afghanistan from pakistan another is the issue of pakistans nuclear weapons which must not be allowed to fall into the wrong hands and then there is the potentially extremely dangerous ongoing conflict with its larger neighbor india which also has nuclear weapons
5979827 after sept 11 2001 musharraf decided admittedly under extreme pressure from washington to allow the fall of the taliban which had been long been backed by his own foreign intelligence agency since then pakistan has been a part of the international alliance against islamist terrorism musharraf also disempowered abdul quadeer kahn more the father of the islamic nuclear bomb who had been secretly selling nuclear know how and technology to dubious regimes around the world
5979828 these strategic decisions were and remain extremely important to the west with the dictators departure there is now at least a theoretical chance that the democratic forces in the country will come to an arrangement with the army which will put a stop to the rise of the islamists in the border regions a return to the times when the army was openly in cahoots with the islamists would be disastrous
5979829 after musharrafs departure the west can now prove that it wants to bring lasting peace to the region
5979830 more commitment on the part of the west would not just be a humanitarian gesture but also in its own interests a half way stable afghanistan would only be possible if its neighbor pakistan receives the same kind of attention in the face of the desolate situation this is a task the will take decades not just a few years
5979831 the new western strategy must start with the choice of words they should make it clear to pakistanis that their hardships have been noticed and that the west is fully aware that only a minority of the 160 million people support the militants that may seem like just a small step but it is necessary as there is great anger in pakistan at being used and then neglected by the west rhetoric however is not enough in the future economic support should at the very least match the military support
5979832 oh that so and so is making me so anxious
5979833 what can we do to stop the endless cycle of reactions stirring up comments and comments stirring up reactions its like stirring up mud in water it makes the water all cloudy

5979858 and they said cornelius the centurion a just man and one that feareth god and of good report among all the nation of the jews was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee

5979918 sky red line hustles its way to 60 mph in 5 2 seconds
5979919 more demanding drivers will be frustrated by its slow throttle response
5979920 base model 2008 saturn sky comes with a 2 4 liter inline 4 engine that makes 177 hp and 166 pound feet of torque
5979921 has a turbocharged 2 0 liter four cylinder with direct injection capable of a very strong 260 hp and 260 lb ft of torque
5979922 the base engine is slow to rev and has little power reserve for quick highway passing
5979923 you have to get the engine revving pretty high to get appreciable power out of it
5979924 the regular sky went from zero to 60 mph in 7 5 seconds
5979925 the red line challenges the porsche cayman at 5 8 seconds
5979926 modestly powered engines and automatic transmissions are the worst combination
5979927 the automatic transmission has no real penalty vs the manual
5979928 with manual transmission averaged 20 8 mpg in mixed driving
5979929 test manual transmission red line averaged 20 1 mpg in mostly city driving
5979930 most drivers will find the cars substantial lateral grip and quick steering enjoyable enough to make the sky a fun and engaging twisty road companion
5979931 in terms of overall performance the skys ride and handling are where it shines the brightest
5979932 tiny trunk fussy top fluttering hood and cheap interior trim
5979933 the transmission tunnel is unusually wide which can put the squeeze on larger drivers
5979934 the interior has tidy forms but ergonomics on par with a game of twister
5979935 just 5 4 cubic feet of space with the top up and practically none with it down
5979936 when the top is down roughly a backpacks worth of space remains though the top must be lifted to reach it
5979937 the sky needs more covered lockable storage so you can leave it parked with the top down
5979938 antilock disc brakes and stability control are standard equipment as is onstar
5979939 the big safety disappointment is the absence of side impact airbags
5979940 unlike the mx 5 the sky doesnt offer side airbags or traction control
5979941 top up rear visibility is better than in most convertibles
5979942 double hump rear deck hinders vision astern for shorter drivers

5979946 from the tone of the article and talking with our sources on the ground we do not think the government has made a
5979947 the potential for china to continue to slow visitation and hence gaming revenues in macau underscores a major risk of operating in this region
5979948 we are forecasting macau gaming revenue growth of only 9 1 percent for the second half of 2008 and a decline of 8 3 percent in the first half of 2009
5979949 there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports this is evident from its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5979950 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely

5979957 any toll increase or gasoline tax will only be for transportation
5979958 i dont think were going to do any debt reduction for a while
5979959 considering all options as we work to consider a funding solution for transportation
5979960 its not a popular issue these days why do you think politicians in the past like whitman and mcgreevey increased the debt because the public doesnt care about it
5979961 not a herculean step were not claiming weve solved every problem the idea is that we make these kinds of choices on a regular basis about how we budget and manage our finances we will get ourselves back into a strong position
5979962 each day you get closer to election day 2009 it makes it tougher and tougher to deal with these complicated issues
5979963 i hate to go after the library are you kidding me
5979964 to believe its proper for a taxpayer funded entity to support one party over another in an election cycle
5979965 youre free to state your opinion whether you know what youre talking about or not
5979966 i have a list of people who are anti library
5979967 i was biting my shirt not to scream at these people
5979968 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5979969 i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5979970 when im president there will be a whole lot more like this not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
5979971 were going to achieve energy independence and were going to do it by using every resource at our disposal to get the job done including new offshore drilling
5979972 we just dont have enough oil underground to drill our way out of this problem
5979973 use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election
5979974 i will let no one question my love of this country
5979975 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5979976 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5979977 as commander in chief i will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten america and finishing the job
5979978 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience vs barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics
5979979 its a place primarily for dogs not people and we hope they have a nice time there
5979980 there is a lot of hostility towards dogs on this island and its part of a mentality that goes back years
5979981 very often youll see fights erupt between people who take their little dogs to beaches and other residents who just cant stand them being there animal rights are such that you will also see dogs being poisoned
5979982 he said you know im agnostic on the science and im agnostic on the politics
5979983 this storm is going to be with us for a while
5979984 thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
5979985 above all unity in the face of continuing russian refusal
5979986 i have an order to stop them here to not let anyone go past
5979987 they just call these foreign journalists move the column in front of them and then when they are gone they put them back
5979988 now you can come in we can figure out where you are in reading whether you need social support services whether you need child care
5979989 the nordstrom of student services every young person is going to be greeted with a smile and treated like the adults they are
5979990 as a city we are not going to be able to get where we need to go without fixing this problem
5979991 the message that 30 000 kids on the street today need to hear is weve created a place for you
5979992 just imagine how many young adults need a hand to move forward
5979993 im going to do whatever it takes with an all out full effort to get sen barack obama elected president of the united states
5979994 other than sen clinton herself i was tremendously disappointed she was not the nominee
5979995 if she is enthusiastic about sen obama then all the clinton supporters should be enthusiastic about sen obama we all need to grow up and get ready for a historic general election and pull together as good democrats
5979996 it is also very important for the supporters of sen obama to extend their hand of friendship relationship and partnership and healing to make it that much easier
5979997 it is a way to motivate and activate people and get them ready for what basically is a bit of a sprint leading to election day
5979998 what i shared with them is sen obama will ultimately get a little extra effort from me in the general election because as much as i was 101 percent for clinton in the primary i was not against sen obama i was just for sen clinton in the general election i am for sen obama more than 101 percent and i am against sen john mccain so it is a heightened support
5979999 we are going to use the mayor to give speeches coordinate field efforts and probably do things outside of philly too he is very popular
