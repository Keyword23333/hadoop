6800001 su contratiempo hizo que me diera cuenta que competir por tu pa s es mucho m s dif cil que s lo defender tu propia marca la presi n parece insostenible
6800002 hizo pedazos los sue os de miles de millones de personas
6800003 a medida que obten a m s y m s t tulos y cada vez m s gente me prestaba atenci n y me apoyaba tuve que soportar una presi n mucho mayor
6800004 me cuesta salir y divertirme con amigos como hacen todos los j venes de mi edad siento todo el tiempo el peso de las expectativas de todo el pa s
6800005 funcionarios de la estatal administraci n general de deportes nos dijeron una vez que si liu no lograba obtener otra medalla de oro en beijing todos sus logros anteriores no significar an nada

6800010 estamos preparados para intervenir r pidamente con un plan de inmunizaciones en las comunidades m s expuestas
6800011 coinciden en t rminos generales con los registrados como del mal de rabia que se ha estudiado en am rica del sur
6800012 son c clicas y ocurren principalmente por el agua que consumen que no es potable
6800013 debemos esperar por los resultados de la recolecci n de muestras hematol gicas y del agua que consumen las comunidades afectadas antes de sentenciar que se trate de casos de rabia
6800014 entre septiembre de 2007 y febrero de 2008 fallecieron 13 ind genas warao a causa de diarreas y otras complicaciones que vamos a someter a estudio
6800015 aparentemente hay personas que no son venezolanas y hacen esta denuncia
6800016 se autoexcluyeron del partido socialista unido de venezuela de gobierno y tomaron esta denuncia como bandera pol tica
6800017 es lamentable que la m xima autoridad de salud del pa s haya politizado estas muertes
6800018 el ministerio no investig que llevo 22 a os en el pa s y 20 trabajando con los warao
6800019 definitivamente es un nuevo fen meno lo que estamos presenciando muestra un compromiso de parte de estos pa ses para impedir que abusadores de ni os ingresen a sus fronteras
6800020 este es el resultado del intercambio de informaci n entre las autoridades
6800021 se cree que la regi n atrae al mayor n mero de turistas sexuales y abusadores de ni os
6800022 son hombres locales aunque los extranjeros est n m s en los medios
6800023 pocos de estos casos llegan los tribunales locales la mayor a son resueltos dentro de las comunidades donde hay transferencias de dinero y compensaciones para las familias de las v ctimas el caso se cierra pero el abusador permanece libre
6800024 por el comercio sexual adulto donde son explotados por personas locales se estima que nueve de cada 10 clientes de prostitutas o prostitutos menores de edad son filipinos
6800025 en la isla indonesia de batam son los turistas de singapur quienes apuntalan la demanda de sexo con menores asimismo los turistas chinos y tailandeses van al estado de shan en birmania para aprovecharse de los trabajadores del sexo menores de edad
6800026 por varias razones los individuos hacen reclamos o cometen actos que debilitan la unidad y la cohesi n nacional debido a su car cter racista tribal tnico o xen fobo
6800027 al implementar estas medidas el estado curar heridas abiertas entre las comunidades de costa de marfil y crear un entorno que fomente la armon a social
6800028 no nos oponemos a una ley contra la xenofobia sin embargo tememos posibles excesos y consecuencias no buscadas
6800029 qu clases de acciones ser n cubiertas en qu punto ser n consideradas criminales debemos proceder cuidadosamente porque semejante ley podr a convertirse en una barrera para la libertad de expresi n
6800030 no hay motivo para debate aqu en la ltima d cada costa de marfil se gan la reputaci n de xen foba adoptar semejante ley cuenta tanto como reconocimiento parcial de este hecho como soluci n al problema
6800031 aplicada de modo adecuado abordar el problema en su ra z haciendo imposible para los marfile os pensar en las diferencias raciales tnicas o religiosas de los inmigrantes en t rminos negativos como con la eliminaci n de la tarjeta de residencia en noviembre pasado el objetivo es restablecer un sentido de justicia para quienes han sido maltratados
6800032 lo que nos perturba en relaci n a esta ley es que no hemos completado los estudios hay algunos vac os donde la ley no toma en cuenta las circunstancias actuales especialmente en lo relativo a partidos pol ticos y asuntos tribales
6800033 los pol ticos dependen del tribalismo para la movilizaci n pol tica cuando los grupos tnicos honran al jefe de estado lo hacen seg n costumbres tribales en la sociedad civil esperamos ver c mo ser aplicada esta ley
6800034 lo m s importante es un entorno de vida que sea pac fico y nos permita contribuir con el desarrollo de nuestro pa s anfitri n y como consecuencia tambi n con el de nuestro pa s de origen uno siempre debe respetar la ley y de igual modo cumpliremos nuestras responsabilidades
6800035 es un paso hacia mejores relaciones entre costa de marfil y los pa ses vecinos desde que se firm el acuerdo de ouagadougou burkina faso 4 de marzo de 2007 hemos trabajado incansablemente por la paz esta ley y la abolici n de las tarjetas de residencia son se ales de que las cosas volvieron a la normalidad
6800036 debemos fortalecer los lazos de amistad hermandad y cooperaci n entre costa de marfil y los pa ses vecinos y extenderlos a toda frica occidental al continente y a nuestros amigos en todo el mundo

6800039 after working at a public library in a small rural midwestern town which i will refer to as denialville michigan throughout this book for fifteen years i have encountered strains and variations of crazy i didnt know existed in such significant portions of our population
6800040 open this book and youll meet the naked patron the greedy unenlightened patrons destination hell the masturbator horny old men mr three hats and a menagerie of other characters you never dreamt were housed at your public library
6800041 we were totally unprepared for reality not only did patrons view and display sexual activities but they often sought attention of the staff in order to heighten their enjoyment it seemed to be a thrill to feign trouble with the printer so one of us would have to go over and be faced with sexual images they asked for help in logging into sites such as hardon com they printed out sexual images and placed the prints on tables bookshelves and counters around the buidlings where they would be seen by others

6800048 i just think katy perry is wasting her time i kissed a girl is not a very sexy song
6800049 she sounds like avril lavigne a product good for her on getting to number one but the song is painful to listen to
6800050 katy says the music business needs more females with opinions but she falls on her own argument because she has been constructed by guys i dont think its real
6800051 wanted the music to be the soundtrack of my audiences lives not their parents

6800062 we go back like a spinal cord weve been friends for a lot of years and have done a lot of stuff together and ive been fortunate to learn so much from this great band and just be friends and now were on the road and it couldnt be better
6800063 john legend is a nickname that some friends started calling me and it kind of grew into my stage name legend is something that i never would have chosen for myself originally
6800064 it grew to the point where more people in my circle would know me by that name than by my real name i had to make a decision
6800065 i was just like you know what lets just go for it people are going to pay attention and im going to either live up to my name or im not my bet was on me trying to live up to the name
6800066 if youre one of the tens of thousands of sag members who dont work enough or earn enough as an actor youre in danger of losing one of your fundamental rights as a union member
6800067 theyve proudly and publicly touted their list of supporters including the names of very high profile actor producers they and their supporters have signed a petition that would end democracy in the screen actors guild and create a class system between the haves and the have nots
6800068 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure

6800070 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology

6800086 you cant explain the feeling you feel after the greatest olympics ever
6800087 i pushed myself to help usain and his quest for three gold medals
6800088 i did what i was supposed to do she did what she was supposed to do
6800089 within a few hours of being released from custody he was found at gatwick again
6800090 one has to comment that people come to this country from all over the world and very often they seem to have found themselves a job straight away particularly in catering
6800091 everyone wants to play their part in making the olympics a success
6800092 the challenge now is to turn what has been two weeks of great success into 10 years of sporting triumph for our country
6800093 i will leave no stone unturned in my determination to make london 2012 a great success
6800094 thats a matter for the queen i think the country will want to see our athletes honoured and the country will want to celebrate their success and give them the permanent recognition they deserve
6800095 not content to win a silver medal in athens in 2004 she decided to change sports
6800096 she was requesting that he come out and give himself up
6800097 we just want to get our belongings and our car and get out of here
6800098 by the time we get to liverpool and chelsea well be in a far better position player wise and hopefully form wise too
6800099 but mondays a big one for us we get that one out of the road get a result there and its a positive step forward given the players who are all coming back
6800100 when you stop playing it is difficult to come back again
6800101 you need rhythm even more when you are a striker because you need confidence if you dont have confidence you are nothing
6800102 we know we can improve but we have players in the olympic games and players returning late
6800103 maybe the game wasnt the best but we can improve clearly
6800104 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future
6800105 everyones aware of the quality that martin has hes a great outlet for us on the left hand side
6800106 most of our attacking threat has come through martin so we need to keep him fit and well and keep getting him into the right areas so that he has a ready supply of ball to work with
6800107 if we do that he will continue to be a threat for us
6800108 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
6800109 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forwards than they did last year
6800110 if you add to that it will be a derby you want a game where you have complete focus
6800111 chelsea have a great squad a great team and their offer is good for me and for the team
6800112 it isnt because of money it is simply because i want to leave my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid
6800113 ive finished my cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything
6800114 i have scored goals won two leagues and that isnt easy i think my period at real madrid has come to an end
6800115 we were hoping to have it be lower but it is what it is
6800116 im on oath and were talking about my religion here
6800117 i cant lie about this he came towards me he walked towards me people are witnesses to this and he said himself that he wanted to do the matam
6800118 he came to me himself i asked him do you want to do it and he said yes
6800119 i said okay ill go and wash the zanjeer for you
6800120 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
6800121 if i knew that this was going to turn all against me i wouldnt have allowed them to do it i wouldnt have done it

6800123 as the concrete legs are blown the tower hits the base and the slots which have been blown above cause it to fold like a bit of wet cloth
6800124 if the slots cut in the shell do not collapse if part of the explosives do not go off one of the worst things that could happen is that all the legs collapse and the thing just sits down on itself
6800125 it is exactly the same as it was before just about 10ft lower
6800126 the stability that the architect has designed into it and it would be much a more hazardous process to climb up again and drill more holes in it to bring it down
6800127 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
6800128 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely
6800129 committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective

6800131 the last time we played them it was 4 0 weve had some good clashes with them and put in some good performances
6800132 hopefully we can carry on with that and put in a good performance the result will take care of itself weve got to be aware that they are all good players
6800133 yakubu up front is a real threat and we need to control him so our defenders will have to be on top of their game other than that we have to go for it and show them that we are really good at passing the ball and dribbling
6800134 hopefully ishmael miller and roman bednar up front will cause them some problems everton have been brilliant under david moyes for the last three years and they finished fifth last year
6800135 its not going to be an easy game but were full of confidence if we can play well weve got a great chance against a good everton team were looking forward to the challenge
6800136 we are looking forward to every game but this is the first home game of the season the crowd will be up for it and the players are up for it
6800137 its going to be a really good occasion we need to put in the right performance and get the right result
6800138 i am really looking forward to it the crowd were really good last year at the hawthorns and we did really well there if we can generate the same atmosphere this season then it will be great
6800139 home form is going to be really important this year if we can play the football we know we can play at home and the crowd get behind us we have a good chance of having a good home record again
6800140 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything
6800141 im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes
6800142 morrison had been adamant against doing commercials and densmore wanted to honor morrisons memory
6800143 if the major political party believes that he is the most talented person then he is the most eligible person for this post
6800144 now it depends on him whether he himself becomes president or nominates someone else
6800145 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6800146 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6800147 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6800148 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6800149 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw

6800287 het enthousiasme van hughes was doorslaggevend in mijn beslissing om voor deze club te kiezen
6800288 het is belangrijk te weten dat de manager je echt wil ik weet nu al dat ik van de engelse mentaliteit houd van de manier van spelen en de manier van leven ik denk niet dat het een moeilijke aanpassing zal worden de bundesliga is een goed kampioenschap en een geweldige leerschool maar in duitsland en ook in belgi al droomde ik alleen maar van de premier league ik vond dat het nu tijd was om de stap te zetten ik heb begrepen dat hughes me vooral als defensieve middenvelder wil uitspelen en dat is ook mijn favoriete positie maar als ik centraal in de verdediging moet spelen doe ik dat zonder morren

6800306 your achievement is praiseworthy not only because you have given india another medal at the games but also more so because you have pushed yourself to the limit in the true spirit of the olympics while being pitted against the best in the world

6800308 this is why weve worked to design these new combines to work as simply and efficiently as possible and why we are confident in our ability to offer an industry exclusive two year unlimited hour warranty on these machines
6800309 no other threshing system has been designed to be so simple there are very few moving parts
6800310 this new grain handling system has taken out the need for a vertical auger that exists on most competitive models instead a 12 foot cross auger feeds the 15 foot high capacity unloader auger
6800311 this patented front feeder is positioned just below the rotor intake area it runs at a constant speed and features opposed helical vanes that evenly feed the rotor and assure a smooth crop flow
6800312 the eight high capacity cab mounted halogen work lights two more than what come as options on most combines provide the most intensity and farthest reach you can get on a standard lighting package
6800313 adjustable extremity lights illuminate the ends of your header a grain bin light automatic unloading auger light and automatic back up lights add to better nighttime visibility
6800314 the new c2000 virtual terminal provides a new level of simple operation and flexibility operators can program up to 20 different crop settings and switch from crop to crop with the push of a button all they really have to do is switch the header and go
6800315 the combines are also equipped to handle two remote cameras with video capabilities in the cab our new designs are all focused on helping to take stress off the operator
6800316 our goal with these machines was to make things easier for the operator
6800317 we have taken every opportunity to improve efficiency reduce the number of drives and eliminate any needless drains on power we are also able to provide the strong warranty package because were confident in the quality built into these machines
6800318 we are trying to figure out the sources the reservoirs of this virus as it moves up the valley
6800319 weve been able to point out that tswv is not going to be an easy virus to solve because it has so many different host plants the thrips like a lot of different plants as well
6800320 at least it is not always a reservoir for the virus and thrips
6800321 fortunately these are mainly late season infections that cause less economic damage
6800322 there were a few materials that reduced the thrips and the best we got was about a 40 percent reduction although that 40 percent might prove to be important for thrips that are reproducing in the crop
6800323 our preliminary results indicate thrips early in the season in fresno and merced counties are relatively clean of the virus
6800324 presumably the thrips are picking up the virus from crop plants early in the season and then in june and july we are seeing more of it in the thrips by then there is a large population of thrips to amplify the virus and spread it later in the season
6800325 thats why we are pushing the idea that once we see the thrips populations building up early in late april and may we need to apply thrips management to prevent the high populations that carry the virus later
6800326 is there any chance of returning the unopened products the easiest would be to take them back to the store where you bought them i called the neutrogena customer service line
6800327 re the opened and half used shampoo conditioner and soap i would go ahead and use them up since if you throw them away you have probably a worse effect because youre dumping more concentrated materials down the drain or in the dump than diluting them somewhat with water

6800363 the update on the deadline is nothing is going to happen with it
6800364 thats whats going to happen with that i dont care about how many threats shaw wants to pull well be doing a press conference if elitexc doesnt see the light here pretty soon and if shaw doesnt stop talking expletive
6800365 as far as nick diaz hes not the no 1 contender out there
6800366 to elitexc he is hes the number one for getting eyeballs to watch them theyre pushing on eyeballs versus a career move for a champion like kj kj is really not the one who gets anything out of the fight diaz does and so does proelite
6800367 but theres nothing in it for kj unless elitexc finally wakes up a little bit thats why well have a press conference i dont like to talk and beat a company thats already beat down im going to give them the benefit of the doubt hopefully theyll see the light
6800368 i would think eddie alvarez is the no 1 contender
6800369 hes definitely ranked higher than nick diaz kj already beat nick diaz
6800370 eddie alvarez is getting married but thats not our problem
6800371 he had a long layoff but hes making more money than the no 1 ranked expletive fighter in the world anderson silva or the same amount
6800372 and now anderson silva is getting bud light sponsorships from ufc president dana white handed down to him
6800373 who do you think negotiated that expletive contract a year and a half ago and if you look at my post it the one i negotiated was a 7 million deal for four years its nothing close to 100 000 and 100 000 as a win bonus as far as trying to bring in the mark dion negatives and stuff good luck show me any negatives on it and thats just a pitch elitexc can use but hey i know my expletive ive been around this sport a long long time
6800374 i dont bend over for nobody and i dont let my fighters do it
6800375 im not a booking agent i dont book my fighters and schmooze deals to work for the promoters i work for my fighters
6800376 i aint waiting until 5 oclock if elitexc officials are holding their breath then someones going to pass out
6800377 thinking silvas not going to be on that card at this point

6800382 from a footballing point of view he possesses many of the attributes i like in a player
6800383 he has got great technical ability and weight of pass has an excellent work rate and an eye for a goal
6800384 i dont think he will have any problems settling into our team or playing in the premier league although he will obviously need some time to adjust to the english game
6800385 we are looking at something but if it doesnt come off then we will carry on as we are

6800700 there was no way you were a victim of what was going on in the mosque where you
6800701 the truth is as long as you could get hold of a zanjeer you were happy and wanted to do it
6800702 i did want to use it at the end because i heard somebody say this is the last session and after this the matam is going to finish
6800703 but under 16 wasnt allowed that is how he did wrong i wanted to do it but he shouldnt have given me the zanjeer thats the main thing
6800704 for a young aged boy to do it with an adult zanjeer it is very harmful
6800705 outgrowing homegrown is your in house billing system hampering your growth
6800706 over the last three years online content of all types has exploded part of this is driven by file sharing and video and audio downloading digital fingerprinting is a way to protect property and get payment from expired contracts or non compliant users it is a way to enforce the terms and conditions of royalty agreements
6800707 we use our proprietary algorithms some of the key features we look at are texture color sharpness and arrangement of elements we look at about 12 characteristics in all this gives us an image dna we then build a profile to score the image
6800708 it is not always foolproof there can be problems with its reliability because of work arounds people can apply to make it more difficult to make a match against a database
6800709 with watermarking the image is altered by embedding a hidden identifier in the image the scanning or reading software finds this hidden copyright label it matches up on this image
6800710 it is not a question of what technology is available it is more an issue of how determined you are to catch violators
6800711 widevine believes that the best solution to fight piracy is content protection applied in ways that make a business model work for both the content owners and consumers using content protection for protection of copyrights ad based revenues and other pay media revenue streams while offering flexibility to consumers to use the device of their choice is a much more affordable for all parties involved
6800712 while watermarking does not identify the content like fingerprinting it does provide a nice theft deterrent for potential pirates if they know the content they stole can be tracked back to them
6800713 one of the most popular content is pornography typically we see a lot of homegrown porn this is more easily recognized by low resolution and poor lighting done by amateurs

6800720 i always knew mohammed was a good footballer and knew he was quick but watching him recently on the track i couldnt quite believe how good he was i was pleasantly shocked
6800721 he has never had any professional training and he is already head and shoulders above other players two years older than him
6800722 imagine how good he could be with a bit of help his brother and sisters and the whole community are so happy and so proud of him
6800723 i have fond memories of performing here in 1973 my wife jaya brought me to southhall to do a show there were five people three of her relatives and two stewards but that has changed over the years as live performances have become much more important as it spreads the legacy of indian cinema
6800724 one of my fondest has been at wembley when we had a crowd of 70 000 it was a truly magnificent experiences and am sure this weekend it will be bigger and better
6800725 when you are shooting for a film the cameras stop rolling and you dont know what the audiences think and it maybe a few months or even a year before the movie is released and your still waiting for the reaction
6800726 but a live performance gives you that adrenaline when you see the fans enjoying the show and applauding it makes you want perform even better
6800727 even though i am sharing the stage with the love on my life my husband and my father in law its not just about the bachchans being on stage as a family its about all of us because thats how we have felt throughout the tour
6800728 however saying that it has been a dream come true to be performing with a legend like my father in law
6800729 its just been over a year since i joined the family and its been an honour and dream doing this with him
6800730 i grew up watching all of amitabhjis movies and sometimes i still cant believe it when i look on stage and see him performing that i am doing this with him
6800731 the whole team have been wonderful its the first time that i can say i have been taken care of another heroine ash has looked after me so well
6800732 the show itself has been fantastic my brother came to watch one of the shows and he said its the best thing that he has ever seen i asked him why was that he told me it was because the show represented everything that is indian cinema
6800733 the issue of global warming is a universal cause and as indians we feel there is a need to tackle it now western countries like the us are guilty of producing harmful emissions that has given rise to global warming but as india develops we too would be producing harmful emissions and will not only become the victims of global warming but also the perpetrators which is why we have chosen this as our cause
6800734 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6800735 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6800736 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6800737 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6800738 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6800739 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6800740 that muslims of undeniable integrity and a track record of poverty alleviation have been profiled as terrorists

6800747 i wasnt a big library person before all of this i used to just buy the books i wanted to read but now with prices the way they are it makes you rethink everything
6800748 a lot of people probably dont think of them this way but libraries are constantly in a state of change
6800749 well see people come in with their laptops and just set up a little office for themselves in the corner
6800750 instead of spending 25 or 30 on a new novel or an audio book theyre borrowing it
6800751 instead of spending that 4 on a video at the rental store theyre coming here
6800752 that was the first time ive ever been in a library and heard that
6800753 she kind of shrugs and she looks outside and turns back to me and says i drive a durango
6800754 we all know the litany the levees of new orleans the i 35 bridge in minneapolis overtaxed air traffic systems construction cranes coming down all over thousands of other structures quivering on their last legs its a slow motion disaster in the making its not an overstatement to say that we may never have a creative opportunity like this one again even as our cities are crumbling around us were also finding ourselves in deep trouble on the energy front t he more forward thinking among us also realize now that solving this problem is going to require us to dramatically re order our economy invest in and invent new technologies and completely re think the way we build cities those sprawling post war cities made perfect sense in their time but increasingly they dont make sense in ours but because all this stuff is already built at a tremendous cost in money and also daunting to consider just how much of it will have to be rebuilt refitted or simply scrapped and replaced or not in order adapt to the new realities its not enough to merely restore whats already there we need to take an entirely fresh look at our assumptions about how cities and towns should be built and put sustainability at the core of all our planning decisions
6800755 fewer trucks delivering packages fewer people going to work theres a very strong correlation between gdp growth and oil usage

6800761 wbre and wnep have been trying to get the kanjorski camp in to meet but so far they will not meet with us

6800777 her years as a democratic operative have taught her to cynically manipulate the truth and thats what shes doing now the fact is that while anwr is the size of the fourth district the total drilling area in anwr is about the size of centerra in when more than 70 percent of voters are in favor of increased domestic exploration and middle class budgets are straining to pay for soaring fuel costs why does betsy markey continue to toe the line for her friends the defenders of wildlife we hope betsy will quit hiding behind false campaign ads paid for by her surrogates and answer to the voters in a debate with congresswoman musgrave on the issue of anwr

6800792 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6800793 anyone that barack obama wants is my choice for vice president but i do think that in the list of considerations there should be somebody from the house of representatives and chet edwards is a person that many of us think would be a good person to have in the mix

6800808 to most of the world local is absolutely mission critical
6800809 local is about 18 to 24 months behind national marketers so we learn from their mistakes
6800810 weve introduced local services on wireless and seen a 20 times increase in click through rate on content
6800811 how do you create relevance at scale thats what its all about

6800826 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6800827 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6800828 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6800829 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6800830 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6800836 as the concrete legs are blown the tower hits the base and the slots which have been blown above cause it to fold like a bit of wet cloth
6800837 if the slots cut in the shell do not collapse if part of the explosives do not go off one of the worst things that could happen is that all the legs collapse and the thing just sits down on itself
6800838 it is exactly the same as it was before just about 10ft lower

6800856 it is absurd to divide people into good or bad people are either charming or tedious
6800857 we want to raise our discontent about the continued manipulation and abuse of the judicial system against the president of the anc jacob zuma

6800864 as a result of this a number of business stakeholders have been meeting for the past 10 months to ensure the continuation of the direct flight from the united kingdom to deer lake
6800865 to date the resort has been subsidizing the cost of this flight and the stakeholders needed to prepare itself for the eventuality of it being discontinued
6800866 the groups mandate is very specific and very clear that due to the major economic impact the cancellation of the flight will have on the humber valley that stakeholders work together with the resort and others to continue with the direct air flight

6800879 theres opportunities for local businesses engineering firms and steel fabrication companies four years before fabrication at bull arm to become knowledgeable and make sure their employees are trained to look at inquire and find out how they can bid on components of whats going to be built at bull arm
6800880 the platform will be built from components and im sure theres smaller components that can be built and shipped from all over the island to bull arm just like we have a consortium of steel fabricators looking to do fabrication and send it up to alberta why couldnt they do that for bull arm
6800881 once that kind of money begins to be injected into the provincial coffers its going to make it much easier for government to spend appropriate amounts of money on health care education and development it certainly gives the province the latitude to invest throughout the province
6800882 we would certainly hope to capitalize on the employment opportunities with regard to the fabrication side of things we do have fabrication shops and we hope to tap into the additional work thats going to be going on in the province
6800883 we have a harbour here thats an ice free harbour
6800884 it is a working harbour its quite busy at times the facilities are in the area and they were built back in the day when either they were hoping to land some things from hibernia or when the norwegians were in the province or those type of things
6800885 if there are companies that are looking to do some work in the province and looking to set up the facilities are certainly there were not the owners but i think i can safely say the owners are more than interested in entertaining anything that would come their way
6800886 from what we see here theres lots of fabrication work to be done
6800887 the premier danny williams himself said you cant work above 100 per cent capacity so lets create more capacity in this area and keep as many of these jobs and as much of this work in this province as we can
6800888 i think all the fabricators and suppliers need to get engaged to see how they can get in there be very aggressive and make sure we get the western newfoundland piece of the pie
6800889 well spend it the way were spending current oil revenues building hospitals addictions centres and using it for pay increases for government employees

6800893 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system

6800897 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6800898 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6800899 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centred
6800900 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise

6800903 we have to follow the law and following the law and doing what the law requires us to do is different from doing what we want to do
6800904 we may want to vote for a particular facility but the law requires us to vote for another or we may want to vote for a particular casino but the law requires us to send it back for more negotiations

6800906 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6800907 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6800908 we continue to view wet seal management as doing the right things in these uncertain times
6800909 as soon as the season finished there was talk of a deal happening and it was on and off throughout the summer
6800910 the main thing is we got there its all signed and sealed and now i can concentrate on the football
6800911 i went back to fulham for pre season and just got my head down and worked hard
6800912 i took into account that it might not happen but obviously i was hopeful it would and we got there in the end
6800913 the six months i spent here was successful and i thoroughly enjoyed it and thats what made me want to come back up
6800914 but its obviously a major disappointment the lads have gone out of europe this season
6800915 the manager has brought in new faces to add to the quality already here so i think there is going to be good competition for places and that can only be healthy for the team
6800916 we believe the company is proving that with savvy marketing and compelling online offerings it is able to transition the business with increasing confidence
6800917 we see this as a bullish sign from a management team that usually sets highly conservative targets on initial fiscal year guidance

6800921 something tells me were not getting that security deposit back
6800922 the house was a total disaster you told me the previous renters had left it in good condition it was absolutely not
6800923 also i am missing from the kitchen 7 wine glasses which i assume were broken a navy blue kitchenaid bottle opener a cheese knive set cheese slicer with matching spreaders all with white handles where did these things go
6800924 and my butcher block it was left outside in the rain and appears to have been out there all month it had never been cleaned after use and was covered in mold
6800925 the laundry situation was horrendous there were towels everywhere and as i mentioned already they were disgusting i threw out an entire garbage bag full of towels and there was still at least 10 loads of laundry to do after it was all sorted out and for some reason the on off knob to the dryer was pried off it could not even be fixed or replaced by the handyman
6800926 the back deck was terrible as well the bbq had been moved to the opposite side of the deck and the gas tank was not on the stand
6800927 shes lucky she didnt find her butcher block in the rd
6800928 candles were burned without any plates under them there was candle wax all over the table tiles and on the deck under the table a step down to the lower deck was broken and left hanging
6800929 there were also cigarette butts put out on the wood deck and many thrown over the deck onto the gravel path by the outdoor shower what ever happened to using ash trays or how about an empty beer bottle there were plenty of those left around ed note oh snap where did these people come from when i finally went to use the pool the skimmer net was torn

6800934 the worlds pretty serious right now and theres an ironic lightness in virulents
6800935 theres a touch of macabre ridiculousness to it i think weve seen a lot of attempts to make serious movies about serious things and it strikes me that we might be a little more artful about how we make a point these days
6800936 i think the dark knight for example is probably the most socially relevant film in the past two three four years despite many attempts to make very serious movies
6800937 dark knight talks to our decision making ability in the world whether or not we can distinguish between good and evil and its done in a way more artful form than ramming something down someones throat which is why virulents appeals to me
6800938 heck even those who hate the very idea of this movie will probably end up seeing it if just to

6800958 listen the performance lately has been a little rougher than anyone would like to go through
6800959 but we didnt make any bones about what we were going to do when we said we were going to go through a rebuilding
6800960 for people who watch the team on a day to day basis that might seem like a long way away but our goal first and foremost was to rebuild our system and we have done that im very pleased by that very pleased when i see the young players we have in our system to go from where we were this time last year to where we are now is amazing

6800963 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6800964 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6800980 multiple resolution allows one entity to be resolved to multiple other entities it can be used to embody e g a parent children relationship or any other relationship a doi name can be resolved to an arbitrary number of different points on the internet multiple urls other doi names and other data types
6800981 multiple resolution is the simultaneous return as output of several pieces of current information related to the object in defined data structures
6800982 doi resolution records may include one or more urls where the object may be located and other information provided about the entity to which a doi name has been assigned optionally including but not restricted to names identifiers descriptions types classifications locations times measurements and relationships to other entities
6800983 as of may 2008 the crossref main system will support assigning more than one url to a single doi a concept known as multiple resolution mr
6800984 crossrefs mr service provides an interim page solution which presents a list of link choices to the end user each choice represents a location at which the item may be obtained and are commonly services that are co hosting the content under agreement with the contents copyright holder
6800985 resolution requests should be capable of returning all associated values of current information individual values or all values of one data type

6801004 i changed the whole design from the year before trying to incorporate all the key elements in which a slopestyle course should have and incorporating some of my own ideas as well

6801009 the media have been used to promote cigarettes and smoking through infamous advertising icons such as the marlboro man and joe camel and through tobacco images in hollywood movies
6801010 the media have also been used to increase smoking cessation and reduce smoking initiation through paid advertising campaigns and public service announcements about the dangers of smoking
6801011 presents the most current and comprehensive analysis of the scientific evidence on the impact of these forces and other media exposures on beliefs attitudes and behaviours concerning tobacco use
6801012 this report sends a loud and clear message to policy makers we need less tobacco company marketing and more anti tobacco advertising
6801013 it shows why we need strong regulation of tobacco products and their marketing to prevent tobacco companies from continuing to target our children it also should prompt states to fully fund tobacco prevention and cessation campaigns that are proven to work and it should spur governments worldwide to implement the international tobacco control treaty which calls on governments to ban all tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship and fund effective public education campaigns
6801014 im very glad that the federal government has thrown its weight behind this important issue
6801015 filmmakers are usually very concerned with issues of social responsibility thats what many of our best films are about but they need more education especially about the very young age at which most people start to smoke and more proof that the smoking in our movies and tv shows if presented irresponsibly can actually be the same as handing a 12 year old a cigarette todays announcement should go a long way towards providing that proof

6801017 i think that we have substitutes who can match robinho
6801018 we have enough players to occupy both the left and the right wing
6801019 coach bernd schuster knows our options very well and i hope that he puts out a competitive team on sunday for us to win
6801020 its robinhos own opinion that he wishes to leave madrid but its a matter that he and the management must deal with together in order to find the best solution for both
6801021 to me the best solution is one that sees madrid affected well
6801022 during the process of the last album i had a fear the band was losing its way
6801023 we had eight months of sitting around we finished that record and i hated it michael and mike couldnt make up their minds
6801024 i kept saying look how great we are live we need to get some of that into a record but no one would agree with me no one came out and loved that record
6801025 when we finished that record i really felt wed made a really great record
6801026 but you can never count on peoples responses i dont know how we would have responded if people had hated it but everyone i played it to gave me a great response it restored my faith
6801027 its just a positive to be around as long as we have been but this is our fourteenth album and to make an album that people think is among our best at this stage is really rewarding
6801028 man sized wreath was supposed to be a b side but people wrote to us and said please put it on the album a lot of the tempos were picked up and the arrangements got tightened
6801029 but theyre not all good the secret is being able to edit yourself
6801030 you have to write the bad ones to get to the great ones and knowing that difference is the main thing
6801031 people are still upset by iraq by the terror threat the lack of effort to clean up after hurricane katrina
6801032 im fairly pessimistic i could see how the democrats could blow it and the fear factor could make people vote for the republican party
6801033 a recent poll said that 81 per cent of americans think the country is going in the wrong direction i cant claim to be an authority on american politics but america is a big country it should be able to make things happen
6801034 it all started when i was six years old it was the beatles they changed my life and put me on this path
6801035 there were other artists from that period like the lovin spoonful and then i heard punk rock and that changed my life in ways you wouldnt believe patti smith the ramones television and then more recently ive been listening to the new albums by the black keys nick cave and portishead
6801036 they were getting to the stage where theyd heard all my music
6801037 i wanted them to hear more so i put all sorts of music on there new and old theyre really proud of me but they make a point of behaving like dads not super cool im pleased about that though
6801038 ill have my year off when im 80 or something

6801056 since vitamin d is produced in the skin through solar or uv irradiation and high serum levels have been shown to correlate with a reduced risk of ms this suggests that vitamin d may regulate the immune response and may promote a hosts reaction to a pathogen

6801058 one device of vitamin d action may be to preserve balance in the t cell reaction and thus avoid autoimmunity

6801062 he is a really nice lad and a great professional so i let him conduct his own affairs we knew the price we wanted and informed the teams who came in for him he went up to sunderland last friday and was very positive about that then manchester city came on to the scene
6801063 he was halfway through his medical when arsenal came in we have no complaints with the deal at all

6801068 we kept to our programme today which was to complete maximum mileage and verify our simulations the circuit is both interesting and challenging and the final sector is definitely my favourite and quite exciting from the cockpit the initial results from today are encouraging but we must now continue working hard to have a solid qualifying session tomorrow and ensure a good level of performance in the race
6801069 i was able to take advantage of the three hours of practice today to complete plenty of laps and gather lots of interesting data which will be useful for the rest of my weekend i really like the track and its a lot of fun in the car the level of grip was poor but we are used to this sort of thing on street circuits i will now work with my engineers to optimise the set up of the car so that we can have a good final free practice session tomorrow morning and approach qualifying in good shape
6801070 you can be forgiven if you havent been following closely the fighting between russia and georgia over south ossetia but there are two lessons that we all absolutely must take away from these events
6801071 mccains tech plan reads like some crotchety technophobe knocked over the bumper sticker wrack at an ayn rand reading revival and tried to rearrange them so it made a policy
6801072 seriously this is approaching chuck norris level aggrandizement how delusional does this guy have to be to imagine himself the hero of every situation hes in to the point that he has to frame himself as a white knight on regulating packet shaping over the internet im actually kind of impressed here are the rest of the sub headings they are of course not about technology they are about john mccain
6801073 the mccain worldview scares the hell out of me technology is complicated and the solutions we need are fairly complex they require an in depth understanding of the problem if youre going to formulate a solution and mccain clearly doesnt understand some of the core problems im still waiting for mccain to release a real technology plan one that helps consumers and addresses the problems were facing instead of protecting corporations and ignoring technology market failings
6801074 mccain has delivered his tech policy and its clear this election will determine whether america willfully becomes a third world participant in the online economy and culture
6801075 we have already had 16 months of no policy in the technology realm and an admitted lack of knowledge by the candidate himself now the campaign cant even get the basics straight on something they absolutely should know the candidates own record
6801076 mccain declines to put net neutrality into law indeed he declines to guarantee all americans the right to obtain the information they want communicate to everyone they want send non obscene and lawful information to anyone they want over the internet why whats the hold up why not assure this paradigm
6801077 we see that millions of americans are using the internet to help each other out and to improve the way government works the obama technology plan encourages civic engagement and openness unfortunately the mccain plan adopts the bush cheney approach which promotes privileges for big companies at the expense of democracy
6801078 where obama has specifics and new ideas mccain has old ideas and positions that would be taken for granted in any administration other than the one now ending the reason is that mccain has a problem hes out of step with the real world
6801079 mccain fails to understand that net neutrality only regulates the internet in the same way the first amendment to the us constitution regulates speech there are many different kinds of regulation and this is one that protects the rights of individuals and an entire public good from being victimized by giant corporations
6801080 the policy statement starts by addressing mccains economic policies which emphasize perpetuation of bushs low tax on capital gains and reduction of the corporate tax rate the fact that tax cuts landed at the top of the list reflects the prominent role that the republican take on fiscal conservatism will play in mccains policy decisions
6801081 the computing challenged mccain who said that he needs his wife to cut on the computer and check email for him
6801082 mccains tech policy is one big giveaway to big corporations an incoherent muddled mess that does nothing to address the challenges america faces in vaulting our technological development into the 21st century not only is he against net neutrality he barely addresses things like wireless spectrum broadband development copyright law reform and when he does its invariably in favor of the big business interests to which his campaign is utterly beholden
6801083 in outlining his policy mccain reiterated his opposition to net neutrality a hot button issue for many bloggers and technology advocates
6801084 can you imagine what would have happened in the media if michelle had lied like cindy lied
6801085 mother teresa convinced cindy to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states one of those babies is now their adopted daughter 16 year old bridget mccain
6801086 with mother teresas encouragement she brought her fourth child bridget home
6801087 someone has the keys to john mccains houses they must have keys who has them do you know where the keys to your houses are
6801088 they have a daily finger on the pulse of who is making the changes

6801124 we had a good day this is a very interesting track and quite different to a typical street circuit with the fact there are some run off areas it is lots of fun to drive and technically demanding while it might look a bit like canada its actually completely different the corners are tricky and it took some time to find the right line we started the day with poor conditions and very low grip because it was very dusty but it improved during the day now it will be interesting to analyse what we have done and see what the others did i think we can be well prepared for tomorrow
6801125 the track is quite nice and i think they have done a good job with the design at their first attempt of course the grip level will come up over the weekend because by the end of the day the grip on the racing line was good but as soon as you put a wheel off line it was very difficult the car is not too bad although i am still struggling a little bit with rear end instability on corner entry and have some traction issues so we still need to fine tune the balance for tomorrow apart from the beginning of the morning when the tyres wore quickly because of wheelspin and the fact the car was sliding a lot the tyres seem to be holding up quite well now the track conditions have stabilised lets see what happens when we go to the next step tomorrow afternoon and empty the fuel tank

6801270 wir glauben es ist aufgabe der politik gegen die extreme teuerung bei den spritpreisen und energiekosten vorzugehen
6801271 wir fordern eine senkung der mehrwertsteuer auf mineral lprodukte und schlie en damit auch das heiz l mit ein das seit vergangenem jahr um 51 prozent teurer geworden ist
6801272 es handelt sich um eine eklatante abzocke an den zapfs ulen die wir uns nicht mehr gefallen lassen wollen dass viele marktf hrer preissenkungen erst versp tet weitergegeben haben hat 200 millionen an mehreinnahmen f r die mineral lwirtschaft gebracht

6801288 they know how its done and see it done every day but they cant do it themselves
6801289 we worked well and acquired a lot of data from this track which over the next few hours will be used to prepare ourselves as well as possible for this weekend from what we could see given the usual unknowns on a friday we can say we are competitive whether we will be competitive enough to reach our target will only be revealed starting with tomorrow afternoons qualifying
6801290 they were two enjoyable sessions with the lap times tumbling bit by bit as the drivers lapped and got confidence in the track layout the track surface is still very dirty and it is easy to make mistakes which can lose you precious tenths and to do a good lap time you have to be perfect i like the track theres a nice atmosphere and i have to say the organizers have done a good job today it was important that we find a good base set up immediately and we managed to do that
6801291 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have known yesterday when i walked the track i thought it would be fun and today confirmed that impression there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere theres a lot of room maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past they have really done a good job today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition overtaking it will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to by getting the best position in qualifying the set up we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6801292 they entered the house through a window shots were fired at the couple
6801293 the parthenon had great resilience to earthquakes as did most classical greek temples
6801294 the ancient greeks apparently had very good knowledge of quake behaviour and excellent construction quality
6801295 n il tempo n il potere della volont cambiano luomo lamore a trasformarlo
6801296 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
6801297 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
6801298 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
6801299 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
6801300 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
6801301 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
6801302 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action
6801303 this is the defendants first trip to the big leagues
6801304 exactly the main question is where there is nothing left anymore
6801305 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6801306 it was good to finally get out on the new valencia street circuit today
6801307 after previously experiencing the lap on the simulator and having a closer look during our track walk yesterday
6801308 we were struggling with very low grip this morning and im sure that was the same for everyone out there the track is very dusty and if you go off line your tyres are quickly covered in dirt which makes it difficult to be consistent
6801309 we made a lot of changes to the car this afternoon which have proved positive and provided a great deal of useful information to study this evening it was nice to do a quick lap at the end on the option tyre hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow
6801310 in the light of criminal charges he is facing in the court in carletonville and an ongoing internal investigation into related matters
6801311 the suspension on full pay does not imply guilt or innocence
6801312 an agreement on his suspension was reached between city manager achmat ebrahim and jonas in the interests of the citys residents public confidence in the metro police and service delivery continuity
6801313 this brings relief to those who are faced with distress and undue hardship we hope the measures will make a difference during these hard times where the cost of living has increased
6801314 people with alternative forms of identification who do not have an identity document should go to the nearest sassa sa social security agency offices to ascertain if they qualify for a grant they will be assisted
6801315 if the major political party believes that he is the most talented person then he is the most eligible person for this post
6801316 now it depends on him whether he himself becomes president or nominates someone else
6801317 this is what weve needed for the last year but they were in the capsule
6801318 it was exactly 150 years ago today that abraham lincoln got off a train at rock island station on columbus street and he was escorted through town in a parade
6801319 fifty years after the debate in 1908 this boulder was placed in the park to commemorate the site of the debate
6801320 in another year from now well be burying another time capsule to mark the 150th anniversary of the debate
6801321 fifty years ago it was hot then and its hot now
6801322 he was a brain he was a scientist and the rest of us were just guys
6801323 fifty years ago it was hot then and its hot now
6801324 access to the conflict affected areas remains the most serious constraint to our humanitarian response i call upon the russia authorities to ensure that humanitarian aid workers have full and safe access to the people in need
6801325 china to set up counseling hotlines in all major cities
6801326 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
6801327 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
6801328 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
6801329 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
6801330 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
6801331 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
6801332 many people still assume that parenting ends when a child turns 18 but in our culture today there is a longer extension of adolescence
6801333 everything is not lost if you are the parent of a college student and trying to do a better job
6801334 if you are open and ready to listen to what they have to say that will help you build a stronger relationship
6801335 the heroes are less likely to provide excuses for themselves and one of the common excuses is everyone is doing it or for some reason or another i am entitled to do it
6801336 i think that the basic honesty of the heroes extends a little bit to other people in that they may think that theyre more honest than others but they dont see other people as extremely dishonest or willing to cheat
6801337 even at schools that have extensive cheating based on what other students are telling me theres always a group of students who will wonder why im bothering to do this survey on their campus because they never see any cheating and they dont think anybody else cheats
6801338 as a result of that if theyre hanging out in groups or cliques that dont cheat therefore they dont see a lot of cheating
6801339 to me those are the people who have met the requirements of what theyre doing and to call that heroic is i think to minimize our basic expectations of students
6801340 we expect them to perform on these assignments and other things without cheating so when they do that thats great and i dont want to minimize that but at the same time im not sure they should be called heroes
6801341 for people that assert that they are definitely going to cheat and people who assert that they are not at all going to cheat it might be difficult to influence their behaviour but people who assert theyre uncertain suggests a population that might be more amenable to interventions
6801342 its a matter of having students involved having faculty administrators families peers anyone who could possibly be involved should be
6801343 do i really need it do i have something like this at home
6801344 yes in this moment i think this might make me happy
6801345 there are more important things in life than buying stuff
6801346 shed get on kicks where she only wanted hard boiled eggs shed watch everything i did no butter or certain seasonings and i couldnt fry anything anorexics become very manipulative with their families it was like walking on eggshells
6801347 one goes right at the eating disorder while the other works to navigate adolescent stressors
6801348 we tell mom and dad that we need to get them on board they are an important part of the solution this study will determine which form of counseling works best
6801349 the behavioral therapy is designed to help families find ways to break that cycle
6801350 it encourages and structures the family situation so that eating is expected
6801351 but we tell the parent we realize you have been through an incredible amount already
6801352 so its teaching the parents to talk in a positive manner thats supportive again it helps the parent become part of the solution in that regard
6801353 i would come out of the hospital and immediately stop eating again because i would be put back in the same environment that triggered it
6801354 as we found out with her illness youre afraid to talk about it and open up about things
6801355 communication completely breaks down because you dont want to upset her
6801356 if we would have had help as a family i think it would have made a big difference
6801357 it may not have sped up her recovery but it would have helped us know how to react to what she was going through
6801358 arnold schwarzenegger is governor of california he killed people in movies
6801359 one of the more vile defendants this court has seen in many many years
6801360 young women in la salle county as their own personal duffel bags
6801361 the natural human tendency is to quit treatment once they feel better
6801362 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
6801363 os trabalhadores reclamam da frota de caminh es que insuficiente
6801364 em casos de acidentes de tr nsito a empresa desconta o valor do preju zo diretamente dos sal rios dos trabalhadores
6801365 se o acidente causado pelo trabalhador tudo bem o problema que o desconto vai direto aos trabalhadores sem antes se apurar de quem foi a culpa no acidente

6801368 people living with mental illness have shouldered the burden of decades of cuts
6801369 there will be more people in the streets in the jails in the emergency rooms
6801370 we did not want to lose any ground in our hospitals
6801371 i think there is still conversation going back and forth
6801372 it was wrong for me to bring it up at this time
6801373 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
6801374 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
6801375 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
6801376 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
6801377 the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal
6801378 the president of the united states is on vacation obviously he is not receiving timely information we recommend the presidents press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences
6801379 i will guard my ways lest i sin with my tongue i will restrain my mouth with a muzzle while the wicked are before me
6801380 we recorded count your blessings in the middle of birmingham and it was very easy to get distracted
6801381 arboga is a village with nothing in it apart from a tiny shop and that was it we actually lived at the studio so it meant we could all just focus on the music fredrik was a cool guy and he taught us how to do stuff so at night after hed gone home wed still be recording the album
6801382 dear mayor i wish it were possible to be personally present to extend my greetings on the day you receive this letter but since i am at the age of 45 and i have no expectation of doing so i welcome the opportunity and extend you my personal compliments and credit you for your sense of loyalty to the public by offering to serve as the mayor of the city
6801383 i ask that they continue the same unselfish spirit of the pioneers who built this city from the wilds in the time of marquette i trust that they will shoulder the responsibilities of the people of almost 70 years ago who authorized the first water and sewer systems and the people of 1958 who have authorized improvements of the sewer system and the building of two new schools
6801384 the devil of company d because of his daring and bravery

6801386 three gentlemen were very interested in the letters and the medal and they sent me to the armory to see reuben moreno
6801387 i dont think i did anything out of the ordinary
6801388 as a vietnam veteran myself i was very proud to do it
6801389 expenditures are higher because the cost of the construction project is added in
6801390 we have some preliminary information regarding state aid but not final allocation numbers
6801391 final vai ser a partida mais dif cil da nossa vida
6801392 its a great feeling i was really excited to go out there and give usain his third world record
6801393 i will remember the beijing games forever because i won two gold medals here
6801394 theres quite a variety of things here but it would be nice to see twice as many
6801395 i think its a good idea a lot of people work during the day and then can stop by here a lot of people also work on saturday
6801396 i think the sunset market is cool hopefully well get a different crowd its also neat to have more artists than the old town farmers market
6801397 many offered to go but i took the first 10 who stepped forward and started for the fortification
6801398 no one who saw us go into the fight expected to see us come out alive but we did and without the loss of a man
6801399 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6801400 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6801401 rice smiled and if i remember correctly said she had had a chance to deal with georgia and its politicians but had not tasted its wine
6801402 everyone wants to play their part in making the olympics a success
6801403 the challenge now is to turn what has been two weeks of great success into 10 years of sporting triumph for our country
6801404 i will leave no stone unturned in my determination to make london 2012 a great success
6801405 thats a matter for the queen i think the country will want to see our athletes honoured and the country will want to celebrate their success and give them the permanent recognition they deserve
6801406 not content to win a silver medal in athens in 2004 she decided to change sports
6801407 im the one to blame at fox news for the premature report
6801408 police say so and so died last night in a wreck and thats all journalism is not reporting your own conclusions but what others are saying
6801409 we are satisfied that if hes in the park hes not going to be found
6801410 its just as possible he walked into the park walked out of the park and is now somewhere else
6801411 i was told that one area they alerted on was a ravine that was so steep that to go in would have required rappelling gear
6801412 if it the rifle was left there with how heavily this park is used it will be found
6801413 we believe shares of aapl will trade on iphone unit volumes for the next several quarters
6801414 so we expect the iphone unit upside to be a positive catalyst for the stock
6801415 2 dead 1 hurt in small plane crash near vegas
6801416 its going to be really difficult for me to come on set and not get involved
6801417 he looked like he had one foot in the grave when i saw him in dayton childrens hospital
6801418 you can see hes excited about being on the field again
6801419 i think i have a lot of opportunities after high school and i want to go to the next level
6801420 i couldnt urinate it hurt just to move my legs i always had a high temperature and when i did urinate just blood came out
6801421 i couldnt breathe they had to put me on oxygen right away
6801422 they had me hooked up to all these ivs i felt sick to my stomach and couldnt move without intense pain
6801423 i kept slowly drifting away and i wasnt tired at all my eyes would get heavy my stomach was hurting and then i lost all feeling in my arms and just slowly drifted away each time i woke up i would be in so much pain then when id drift off id wonder if it was the end for me
6801424 but once wed gotten over the initial shock we teased him like we always did you can bet that were on top of it when it comes to mrsa though none of us want that to happen to us weve seen its not good
6801425 i just tell them to wash their hands wash your uniform if you have an open wound tape it up and they get it
6801426 ive gone to camps at ohio university uc bowling green and toledo
6801427 im anxious to show colleges im good enough to play for their school
6801428 the bronze medal may not be important from a brazilians point of view but in the future we will be proud
6801429 we deserve respect as a group of players because we took some criticism after the defeat to argentina
6801430 everyone came to china for a medal and we got one its not what we were expecting at the beginning but its one of the most important awards
6801431 ready to light up as soon as i get off

6801447 the aim was to warm up the atmosphere around the launch of the iphone
6801448 its great for poker in asia that theres a major tournament like this here in macau
6801449 its attracting all of the top players in the sport and letting the world know that there is real poker real poker players and that anybody can win millions of dollars
6801450 we are excited to have so many of the worlds top players coming to the grand waldo casino in macau this year
6801451 its a testament to the success of season 1 that champions such as chan joe hachem scotty nguyen men the master nguyen and barry greenstein are eager to compete on the felt during our second season were privileged to continue leading the growth of poker and poker culture in asia and expect local and regional player participation to at least double during this years events the pokerstars net appt is taking poker to a new level in asia pacific and when this macau tournament is broadcast on tv around the world we expect this growth to continue
6801452 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
6801453 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
6801454 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
6801455 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
6801456 i feel like im checking my blackberry every ten seconds
6801457 im checking for the message often but have stopped listening to the guesses du jour
6801458 it has become like waiting for the birth of a baby that is 10 days overdue
6801459 i have been rather tied to my electronic devices and its made me a little loopy
6801460 i have slightly spotty cell service where i am so ive hired some summer interns to light a series of warning fires along the distance between good cell service and my current location
6801461 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6801462 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6801463 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6801464 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6801465 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6801466 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6801467 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6801468 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6801469 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6801470 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6801471 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6801472 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6801473 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6801474 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6801475 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
6801476 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
6801477 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
6801478 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
6801479 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6801480 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6801481 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6801482 anyone that barack obama wants is my choice for vice president but i do think that in the list of considerations there should be somebody from the house of representatives and chet edwards is a person that many of us think would be a good person to have in the mix
6801483 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6801484 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw

6801505 besides all of the horror and disbelief and shocking things that come out of war there are also the caring human sides and moral aspects of what we need to learn why do we fight this hard in war and put ourselves and others through it if we dont learn from it

6801541 sci fi has enjoyed tremendous success with stargate sg 1 and stargate atlantis and were proud to be the home of the new stargate universe
6801542 universe will continue the stargate legacy of vibrant storylines and compelling adventures but will re invent the format in a whole new way
6801543 the stargate franchise enjoys a loyal and substantial fan base that welcomes each new installment with fevered enthusiasm
6801544 we are delighted to be working again with brad and robert and look forward to seeing new adventures with the launch of stargate universe on sci fi channel next year stargate universe will continue the longstanding relationship between mgms stellar science fiction franchise and cables premiere destination for all passionate science fiction fans
6801545 stargate universe is a natural progression for the stargate brand and for our network stargate sg 1 and stargate atlantis have been key drivers for sci fi and we are looking forward to seeing where this next chapter leads as each new installment of the stargate franchise further engages the sci fi audience
6801546 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humour while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories

6801549 fortunately the last of our british team had left the day before the conflict began but we are still deeply concerned for our colleagues and friends living in georgia
6801550 we were aware of heightened military activity during the recent excavation but we did not feel particularly threatened
6801551 it was obvious there was a fair bit of tension but there was no way of knowing what was about to happen we have recently started to get word from our colleagues in georgia an email on the 20 august said that russian troops have actually been in nokalakevi itself but the picture is far from complete and very worrying
6801552 a small regional museum in nokalakevi houses much of the material that we have excavated over the years and of course there is a concern the museum might become a target for looting
6801553 a few years ago 1 500 was raised to help repair the local museum and our dig house it is heartbreaking to think that this good work might have been undone but of course our main concern is for our friends and colleagues in georgia

6801583 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on set up this morning
6801584 we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session in p2 our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant it was difficult to immediately confirm our final set up changes nonetheless were in pretty good shape and im looking forward to tomorrow
6801585 i immediately found a good balance at the front end and slowly dialled in the rear during the first session but the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car in the afternoon we made a number of changes which seemed to pay off for us by the end of the session the car was working well and the balance felt really good todays progress is very encouraging
6801586 its always an interesting engineering challenge whenever you arrive at a new circuit and today in valencia was no exception we spent two very productive sessions concentrating on tyre choice while running appropriate fuel levels lewis and heikki also performed faultlessly allowing us to collect plenty of valuable data which we will go through tonight

6801664 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6801665 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6801666 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6801667 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6801668 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6801669 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms

6801683 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6801684 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6801685 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6801686 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6801687 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6801688 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6801689 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6801690 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6801691 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6801692 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6801693 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6801694 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6801695 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6801696 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6801697 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6801698 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6801699 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6801700 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6801701 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6801702 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6801703 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6801704 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6801705 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6801706 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6801707 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6801708 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6801709 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6801710 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6801711 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6801712 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6801713 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6801714 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6801715 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6801716 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6801717 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6801718 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6801719 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6801720 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6801721 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6801722 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6801723 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6801724 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6801725 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6801726 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6801727 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6801728 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6801729 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6801730 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6801731 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6801732 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6801733 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6801734 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6801735 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6801736 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6801737 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6801738 its my understanding that family members actually discovered the patient had they not been as alert and keeping track of what was going on with him he could have been there for an extended period of time and could have expired
6801739 its my understanding that family members actually discovered the patient
6801740 had they not been as alert and keeping track of what was going on with him he could have been there for an extended period of time and could have expired

6801760 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
6801761 senator obama so and again im im not going to prolong this but i just want to be clear because i think this was the source of the objections of the medical society as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved is that correct
6801762 fetus or child however way you want to describe it

6801796 japans finance ministry said exports to china outstripped those to the u s in july it was the first time japan had sold more goods to china than to any other country since the government started keeping records in 1950 japans stuttering recovery has been fueled by exports to china and these latest figures may allay fears that it is again heading towards recession prompted by data showing that the economy shrank in the second quarter of this year exports to china were boosted by demand for raw materials as the country prepared to host the olympics and by the rebuilding effort in sichuan province which was hit by an earthquake in may

6801805 did throckmorton invite you guys over for wine and cheese
6801806 thats not true he was out in his yard a lot
6801807 one day i was interested in something throckmorton said and i decided to go see him i forget what play we were covering it didnt really matter
6801808 consider hed said as he began his lecture gazing out past the horizon the infant solipsist
6801809 you could work an infant solipsist into anything if you were good and throckmorton was good he was very good and it got my own mental wheels turning he had only himself to blame for it but i felt compelled to pay a visit to the great man during his office hours
6801810 when i knocked at the doorframe he looked up but he didnt just look up he looked past me and not just past me but past everything as if there were no wall in his office as though he were looking to the horizon and past the horizon i suddenly realized that was how he looked at everything
6801811 oh yes said throckmorton professor belwether told me as soon as id finished the lecture that id be sorry for that phrase belwether was team teaching the course with throckmorton and throckmorton kept gazing a little upward as though he expected an important comet to arrive at any instant and here i was instead the predicted retribution for using the phrase infant solipsist an eager undergraduate appearing in his office in hopes that hed parse it further no important comet would show up that hour just a sophomore with inchoate reactions to whatever hed been reading

6801828 by conveying the bible to people we certainly do them a most interesting act of kindness we thereby enable them to learn that man was originally created and placed in a state of happiness but becoming disobedient was subjected to the degradation and evils which he and his posterity have since experienced the bible will also inform them that our gracious creator has provided for us a redeemer in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed that this redeemer has made atonement for the sins of the whole world and thereby reconciling the divine justice with the divine mercy has opened a way for our redemption and salvation and that these inestimable benefits are of the free gift and grace of god not of our deserving nor in our power to deserve the bible will also encourage them with many explicit and consoling assurances of the divine mercy to our fallen race and with repeated invitations to accept the offers of pardon and reconciliation they therefore who enlist in his service have the highest encouragement to fulfill the duties assigned to their respective stations for most certain it is that those of his followers who participate in his conquests will also participate in the transcendent glories and blessings of his triumph

6801851 there were sharp differences in year ahead home price expectations depending on whether home prices had increased or decreased in the past year

6801867 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6801868 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and you got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6801869 theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6801870 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6801871 the question isnt how many homes mccain has but how many homes does mccain have where he got a sweetheart deal involving tony rezko

6801880 this is a 24 hour a day seven day a week business no matter what it will restrict what we can do at this terminal
6801881 need not be used exclusively for the existing marine related industrial activity
6801882 were intending for development uses to go on the upper level
6801883 if they think were doing anything at ground level theyre misreading the document
6801884 whatever is built will be as a result of the consensus of the stakeholders
6801885 a forest of support columns beneath it which would interfere with cargo business
6801886 theyll probably decide its not economically feasible to build a deck so theyll build on the terminal
6801887 weve got nothing against our brothers and sisters who work in hotels or restaurants but this plan would take away top paying jobs and replace them with low paying jobs
6801888 i kind of feel like theyre doing the same thing to me
6801889 were working on it now which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010

6801892 its not only an action movie it goes beyond that we have the humanity just so close to the chaos its frightening its talking about clones its talking about global warming its about terrorism its about the danger of science and i know im very afraid about the danger of science sometimes its great and sometimes it goes too far and its dangerous its about religion so its about all of that with the science fiction its not really science fiction to me its anticipation
6801893 its always exceptional for a french girl to arrive on this kind of project and to have the opportunity to be on this kind of huge set and action movie because were not used to shooting action movies in france
6801894 its very exciting and it happens maybe just one time in your life so i took it and it was great to have this experience and to work with vin diesel because hes such a nice guy i took a lot of pleasure and it was just a great memory i spent five months making babylon a d and everything was a dream every day on it it was crazy it was huge it was completely mad

6801908 i was intrigued to discover that the middle ages had had a love affair with reason logic and natural philosophy
6801909 i began to wonder more and more why they hadnt just gone ahead and had the scientific revolution then and there i mentioned this in passing to
6801910 this is philoponus experiment of motion on an inclined plane that galileo would later undertake
6801911 i decided to use the rediscovery of philoponus work in which he demonstrated aristotle wrong on many counts
6801912 historically this came late in the middle ages so i decided to let gerard of cremona translate it early in the middle ages and then let it percolate for a couple of centuries
6801913 i had to make a scientific revolution in the span of a single story
6801914 work that might take a lifetime or two was compressed into a single glorious summer what i tried to portray was something of the sheer joy of discovery when what was being discovered was something long familiar to the readers
6801915 were working on it now which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010

6801918 i agree dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes thats why when these games are completed we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs
6801919 although killing seals is prohibited by federal law the lynann a 136 foot craft is operating under special orders from a department of the federal government
6801920 the biologists are particularly concerned with determining the age of the seal and their reproduction systems ages of the seals can best be determined by examination of the teeth biologists said
6801921 although armed with a whale gun the ship is normally used to capture whales the crew has found that shotguns are the best method to kill the seals
6801922 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognize that in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it
6801923 you cant expect food nutrition directors to be filling up their trunk with produce
6801924 there really could be a positive connection between farms and schools if we can have someone to fill the gaps
6801925 they will make a meaningful contribution to a more nutritious diet for washington school kids and economic opportunity for the states fruit and vegetable growers
6801926 theyre going to see a difference right away in what they can do and provide for their kids
6801927 oddly enough to those of us that are pretty used to buying fruits and vegetables things like snap peas or jicama dont sound so unusual but for many kids its the first time theyve tasted a mango or even a radish
6801928 just like parents struggling at home were having to evaluate all of our purchases
6801929 this wont cover the increases entirely but it will help
6801930 i assumed that once this bill passed wed have some folks calling us but no one has
6801931 so were back to where we were before trying to broker our own relationships
6801932 this will allow kids to have those fresh fruits and vegetables at different times throughout the day
6801933 that way the kids who are high poverty wont go home hungry
6801934 the grant program lets us do some wonderful things at one school

6801939 i spoke to a player last night and he has agreed to come in principle
6801940 there are just one or two things to be ironed out and theres one other position id like to strengthen before im finished
6801941 with kenwyne jones being injured we did lack some physical presence up front
6801942 were delighted with the two signings we needed more strength up there and they will give us it
6801943 theyre not really happy times for me but its still all right
6801944 its frustrating if you work hard especially with all the rumours going on and then you dont play
6801945 sunderlands interest is very much for real and im looking to see in the next week whats going to happen because im 31 in november so sitting on the bench or not playing is not an option for me
6801946 if i cant make the starting line up at blackburn then im wasting time
6801947 the manager has made his intentions clear he doesnt want me to go he wants me to stay and from my point of view i respect the manager
6801948 i cant have any complaints jason was awesome at everton and i cant see the reason why he should be taken out of the starting line up and obviously roques fantastic as well scoring goals
6801949 those two deserve to play but if i cant get in the team then yes i would want the move to sunderland
6801950 but lets just hope we all end up happy i end up being happy blackburn end up being happy everyone in the whole circle ends up being happy
6801951 benni mccarthy is a very important member of our squad and thats how paul sees it
6801952 our position has not changed he is not for sale
6801953 we have a very strong squad with competition in most areas but weve only had one great result there are 37 more games to come
6801954 pero nunca en la misma proporci n que los relacionados con la energ a

6801961 los protagonistas son las personas y los retos que tenemos en la comunitat valenciana para seguir creciendo y mejorando nuestro bienestar
6801962 tan importantes como la educaci n la sanidad la justicia la seguridad el respeto a nuestro entorno el agua o el transporte p blico
6801963 reforzar el control democr tico de las autoridades y para que el presidente de la generalitat
6801964 los puertos de la comunitat crecieron el doble que los de espa a en los ltimos diez a os
6801965 no se puede aceptar que de nuevo la nica participaci n del consell sea el nombramiento y el cese de las autoridades competentes tal y como ocurre con los tres puertos de inter s general de la comunitat
6801966 el consell s lo nombra a las autoridades portuarias y no pone ni un euro
6801967 no puede apropiarse del xito de la gesti n de una infraestructura que depende del ministerio de fomento la propia autoridad y por extensi n del gobierno de espa a

6801969 de los que si tiene competencia s lo ha destinado 16 de los 160 millones de euros contemplados en el pie que se comprometi a invertir
6801970 este no es un buen camino para exigir la participaci n de la generalitat en la gesti n de los aeropuertos
6801971 esforzarse por cumplir con sus competencias en lugar de sacar pecho por xitos que no son suyos
6801972 pone todos los recursos a su alcance para terminar con la lacra de la violencia machista
6801973 son las mujeres v ctimas y su entorno las que tienen que dar el primer paso
6801974 la sociedad est cada vez m s concienciada de que los malos tratos son un problema que nos ata e a todos por lo que hay que denunciarlos y animar a las v ctimas a hacerlo
6801975 significa que las mujeres son cada vez menos tolerantes ante los malos tratos
6801976 afortunadamente no esperan al mal trato f sico para solicitar ayuda
6801977 una cosa est clara y es que sean del tipo que sean condenan a la v ctima a una vida de miedo y tristeza
6801978 desde la generalitat queremos decirles que amenazar insultar o levantar la mano a una mujer ya es un maltrato porque supone el desprecio por su persona y un menoscabar su autoestima por el mero hecho de ser mujer
6801979 la violencia sobre la mujer tiene unas caracter sticas espec ficas en la que el maltratador agrede a su v ctima por el mero hecho de ser mujer
6801980 aqu se engloba todo tipo de agresiones desde las f sicas que incluyen las agresiones abusos y acoso sexual hasta las ps quicas
6801981 no es un fen meno que afecte a las personas con bajo nivel de estudios o de una procedencia humilde ya que de todas las mujeres que han acudido a los centros mujer 24 horas el 47 1 por ciento ten a un trabajo remunerado
6801982 cleaning up with children around is like shoveling during a blizzard

6801986 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
6801987 they seem to think our community is their open job site
6801988 it is their contention they are not required to do so its our contention that they are
6801989 if we were going to have our landscape dotted with refrigerator size boxes we should have some control over them
6801990 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6801991 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6801992 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6801993 youre living in service to others and working to make the world a better place i call that gods work no matter what you believe
6801994 youre living in service to others and working to make the world a better place i call that gods work no matter what you believe
6801995 to resolve the controversy fair organizers decided to offer a 2 discount to any fairgoer who presents a bulletin from a church or other religious service or a printout from a religious or secular groups web page
6801996 the weak position of the federal budget became the main reason of the black august in 1998 in the summer of 1998 the finance ministry could fund only a half of its spending with the help of taxes the other half was funded at the expense of borrowings when markets stopped lending money to the ministry the federal budget was unable to function properly
6801997 i was very surprised to hear yesterdays statement from finance minister kudrin who did not say a word about the budgetary policy and the weakness of russia s budget during the period of the crisis moreover i was surprised to hear mr kudrin laying the blame for the crisis on the imf if the minister said what he really thouhgt then it means that our government had not learned any lesson from the events that happened ten years ago
6801998 it was the price which russia paid for moving forward
6801999 take it on the run baby if thats the way you want it baby then i dont want you around
6802000 russia is clearly irritated at what it perceives as u s meddling in its neighbourhood
6802001 it seems to be sending a message that if you play on our periphery well play in yours
6802002 consistent work to restore traditional relations in all areas of cooperation
6802003 we need to re establish positions on cuba and in other countries
6802004 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
6802005 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
6802006 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
6802007 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted
6802008 russia seeks to reassert itself as a world power which includes a renewed presence in latin america while cuba wants to diversify its economic partners to reduce its dependence on venezuela
6802009 there is still a big consumer concern about irradiated products and i think that is the single biggest issue
6802010 the scientific community looks at it safetywise as that theres nothing wrong with it at all
6802011 its going to be a business decision as to whether producers use it or not
6802012 it is a safe process you are not going to glow in the dark
6802013 to get people to focus on what a pasteurization process does rather than how it does it
6802014 we really think the manufacturers just want to hide the process from the public
6802015 it hasnt been a commercial success in the beef industry and i dont expect that it will be anymore so here
6802016 e voi non lavete il problema dei medici obiettori di coscienza

6802026 we can earn our way through any economic cycle except one like the great depression
6802027 once you start putting in the plumbing hookups and the roads you cant abandon these projects halfway
6802028 we are confident that we will be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter
6802029 we have been a little slower to generate cash than some of our peers because we were one of the fastest growing home builders it takes a little longer for us to slow down the train
6802030 the linchpin to our bullish thesis has been the emergence of land constraints
6802031 this will allow the builders to outperform expectations in any given demand scenario
6802032 but when housing demand drops as much as it has the supply constraint cannot save you from near term pain

6802036 suggests to us that buyers response to higher incentives early in the quarter did not meet managements expectations
6802037 we think higher incentives may be necessary to boost sales during the spring season
6802038 builders continue to use both price and nonprice incentives to bolster sales and reduce inventory
6802039 through additional incentives and discounts in order to maintain the pace of sales that we were targeting for those locations
6802040 this marks the first positive monthly comparison since the market slowdown began
6802041 our first quarter is always the slowest seasonal period for new contracts so it is difficult to get a good feel for the strength of the market
6802042 most of our markets have begun to show signs of stabilization but we are not yet confident that we have found the bottom of this housing slowdown
6802043 to use a weather analogy it is no longer a monsoon but it has been downgraded to scattered thundershowers

6802075 im not a fan of tim pawlenty by any means and paricularly find his views on the role of government troubling
6802076 pawlenty definitely appears to be the safest pick on the reported short list
6802077 like romney he has gubernatorial experience but he doesnt have the flip flop problems or high negative ratings
6802078 pawlenty has more appeal among two constituencies that will be key to a mccain victory evangelicals and blue collar workers with democrats poised to run a campaign portraying republicans as out of touch see yesterdays houses debate it makes more political sense to tap pawlenty who grew up as the son of a milk driver to blunt such attacks rather than nominate another really rich dude who will only add fuel to the fire
6802079 furthermore pawlenty was a mccain supporter from the beginning while democrats would have access to reams of video of romney ripping apart mccain including on the fact that he doesnt understand economics what is romneys response going to be that he changed his mind yeah thatll be helpful

6802103 people treasure things that have a story ive had many of my customers come back to tell me where the things ive made have traveled or what special events they were part of its a very rewarding experience and shows like craftin outlaws help make that happen
6802104 i think making it a more well rounded event is better it draws more people and gives them reasons to stick around and browse more
6802105 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without jim morrison
6802106 while the three partners had agreed to the commercial morrison vehemently disagreed and the commercial was not done
6802107 morrison had been adamant against doing commercials and densmore wanted to honor morrisons memory
6802108 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6802109 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6802110 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6802111 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6802112 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6802113 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6802114 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6802115 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6802116 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6802117 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6802118 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6802119 if you trust every web site but not a government
6802120 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6802121 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6802122 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6802123 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6802124 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6802125 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6802126 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6802127 babe im really sad all the guys are going home to their wives and youre not here
6802128 i know but im not a football wife i have a career
6802129 where once displeasing moscow would seem a strong argument against deployment now theres reason to create a negative consequence for russias behavior

6802142 what has forrest gumps mamma got to do with me
6802143 we believe this is a clear case of infringement designed to take advantage of the herbal essences business and its consumer loyalty
6802144 this is a serious case of intellectual property infringement and we are asking the court to stop the distribution of these products to protect the equity of herbal essences
6802145 i might ask a family member to look after the dog while i left the room
6802146 we dont believe she was taken by another animal so she is out there
6802147 every single version of the bill was neutral on roe each one affected only babies already born not ones in the womb
6802148 essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion
6802149 we are looking at an all hands on deck kind of thing where we call in extra help this is not something you see every day
6802150 the water has covered the beach there isnt really any beach left at all
6802151 we havent been out since tuesday because of the bad driving
6802152 it was hard to see because of all of the rain but we have plenty of canned food
6802153 as far as we know we cant leave our condominiums to get to highway a1a because the police are blocking it
6802154 im up here im not unfortunate i can cook a hamburger ive got power i feel very blessed
6802155 but there will have to be lots of consumer education before they will accept it
6802156 maybe the science community has not spoken enough about this
6802157 but they will be doing it more and more now
6802158 it gives the industry another tool to increase food safety
6802159 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food
6802160 with all the scares that there have been involving spinach this is a good step forward
6802161 why arent they looking at the source of what causes these problems
6802162 the growers and shippers of spinach and iceberg lettuce will conduct assessments to see how effectively this can be accomplished with produce and what investment will be needed
6802163 i think there is a long way to go before irradiation is implemented
6802164 in a way its like erasing your mistakes and saying something is safe that is not produced in a safe manner
6802165 the treatment of food with ionizing radiation can produce a variety of beneficial effects
6802166 however it should be clear that irradiation is not a remedy for unsatisfactory production practices
6802167 it is unlikely that irradiation will have significant nutritional impact on a balanced diet of raw canned and ready to eat fruits and vegetables
6802168 we dont have much concern about the safety of irradiated foods
6802169 the further away you get from doing something like idol if youre not right back out there with a single or an acting opportunity people tend to forget
6802170 i think i had a different vision a vision for myself
6802171 but if we could capture the chicken little that i saw on american idol i felt like wed be in good shape
6802172 i dont think kevin realized going into it how physical the role would be
6802173 ive already told fans who have asked about the movie if youre as young as i think you are you should probably wait about five to seven years to see it
6802174 there were people who worked on labor pains who had previously worked with her on other projects
6802175 but i heard from those same people that there was a drastic improvement and she was doing really well i can tell you for a fact that every day i was on set and working she was there on time and she delivered really admirably
6802176 it was what id do as a kid id turn the volume down and start calling the game myself
6802177 whether its the super bowl or the world series i want to be the first guy who gets to sing the national anthem and then go upstairs and call the game
6802178 that reminds me of a story so dirty im ashamed to think of it myself
6802179 these facilities are giving out brochures about this wonderful superlative care one need only look at their regulatory history and see that its just not true
6802180 though we do not admit liability we chose to settle this case because we are and have been firmly committed to the well being of our residents
6802181 litigation is a long expensive process that would take our focus away from where it belongs on our residents
6802182 it was primarily viewed as an opportunity to alter and change the way care was provided for people who were still in those facilities
6802183 any leftover money will go toward improving the quality of care in the homes
6802184 protecting the health and safety of californians is our highest priority
6802185 all complaints of poor care in nursing homes and hospitals are taken very seriously and investigated
6802186 people most in need of a clear and explicit warning regarding ssl certificates are inexperienced users and those are not very likely to understand the error message that firefox 3 is displaying a large portion will simply be scared away thinking that the web site is broken
6802187 mozilla firefox 3 limits usable encrypted ssl web sites to those who are willing to pay money to one of their approved digital certificate vendors this policy is bad for the web
6802188 used to be the stuff of scary security fiction but now they are point and click
6802189 the only thing that will tell you whether the sites you are visiting are real is the existence of a trusted certificate which only the legitimate site can have

6802201 dragons is a friends and a dragon cans fly i fly away and fight da monster i am da dragon nots a monster
6802202 certainly the economy is fundamentally and structurally more sound in the euro zone compared with the uk
6802203 so if i had a choice purely on a yield play youre probably looking at gilts outperforming bunds
6802204 to me its about interest rate differentials or expectations of interest rate differentials
6802205 relative to the euro zone we do see outperformance in terms of resteepening of the uk gilt curve relative to euro zone
6802206 if youre going to play that trade then you should be long gilts against europe but you probably want to play the short end rather than the long end
6802207 we still see the risk that the ecb might hike again whereas in the uk we are looking for cuts given that growth is going to be weak in the next few quarters theres more downside risks to rates for the central bank in the uk than probably there are in the euro area at this juncture
6802208 if we are right in assuming that there will be deeper rate cuts coming relative to whats priced in the market in terms of the uk eventually i e in terms of 2009 relative to the euro zone then 10 year gilts will also outperform
6802209 in general we probably favour being short the uk versus europe purely because we think the rate dynamic can favour europe going forward
6802210 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6802211 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6802212 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6802213 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6802214 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6802215 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6802216 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6802217 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6802218 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6802219 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6802220 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6802221 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6802222 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6802223 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6802224 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6802225 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6802226 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6802227 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6802228 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6802229 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas

6802231 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6802232 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6802233 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6802234 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6802235 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6802236 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6802237 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6802238 las lesiones de la piel mejoraron r pidamente despu s de interrumpir la ingesti n de esteroides y por supuesto de seguir un tratamiento espec fico basado en un antibi tico y un antis ptico
6802239 las cicatrices que este paciente tiene en todo el pecho probablemente permanezcan el resto de su vida
6802240 puede causar fiebre y malestar general e incluso evolucionar a lo que se denomia acn fulminans que si no se trata a tiempo puede derivar en fallecimiento
6802241 aunque no tan aparatoso en ocasiones vemos en la consulta casos de acn en j venes deportistas con hipermusculaci n trastornos menstruales y acn en mujeres con importante masa muscular
6802242 hipertensi n arterial arritmias y fallo cardiaco deterioro hep tico aumento de colesterol atrofia testicular pubertad precoz depresi n y cambios de comportamiento
6802243 cuando el empleo de anabolizantes se prolonga en el tiempo se da a el h gado hasta llegar incluso a la cirrosis hep tica
6802244 se presentan manifestaciones en la piel propias de una insuficiencia hep tica como alteraciones en las u as ictericia piel amarilla xantomas dep sitos de grasa en la piel entre otras
6802245 esto se traduce en problemas de piel grasa y acn que en casos severos puede evolucionar a un acn conglobata como el del caso cl nico recogido en the lancet e incluso un acn fulminans
6802246 el acn aparece en el 45 de los que abusan de esteroides anabolizantes androg nicos por lo que es un signo que debemos tener en cuenta en los pacientes deportistas
6802247 en aquella poca era frecuente ver en la consulta culturistas j venes calvos
6802248 goodfellas the part where she points the gun in ray liottas face
6802249 estamos teniendo un trato bien espec fico junto a ellos
6802250 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6802251 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6802252 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6802253 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6802254 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6802255 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6802256 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6802257 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6802258 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6802259 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6802260 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6802261 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6802262 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6802263 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6802264 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6802265 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6802266 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6802267 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6802268 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6802269 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6802270 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6802271 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6802272 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6802273 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6802274 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6802275 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6802276 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6802277 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6802278 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6802279 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6802280 i havent been to a really good party there since the jovial phil laders tour of duty came to an end in 2001
6802281 if you talk to warren buffet hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
6802282 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
6802283 the purchase order from novamed comes as another milestone for our company as more companies and individuals discover the unique sterilization capabilities of our anti microbial products
6802284 obviamente el mundo no se acabar cuando se encienda el lhc
6802285 si yo supusiera que esto fuese a suceder estar a bien lejos de aqu
6802286 un riesgo significativo de que la operaci n del colisionador tenga consecuencias no deliberadas que puedan resultar en la destrucci n de nuestro planeta
6802287 el lhc s lo va a reproducir lo que la naturaleza hace cada segundo lo que ha estado haciendo durante miles de millones de a os

6802289 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6802290 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6802291 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6802292 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar

6802306 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6802307 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado

6802312 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6802313 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6802314 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6802315 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6802316 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley

6802337 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

6802344 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6802345 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6802346 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6802347 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6802348 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

6802373 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6802374 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise

6802452 es que me est n viendo mucha televisi n y est n leyendo los escritos de far ndula en los peri dicos y revistas en esos medios que s lo hablan de la vida ntima de las personas y no la parte buena de la carrera de los artistas
6802453 con este disco voy a dejar a un lado el pasado que me ha afectado
6802454 como um ponto de viragem n o menos significativo que o 9 de novembro de 1989 quando caiu o muro de berlim
6802455 we lost 20 per cent of our customers in the first week
6802456 external review did not support all the interpretations made in the correspondence
6802457 the decision not to publish in this case was made by the editorial executive committee and a full explanation was given to the authors
6802458 the review the matter to see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6802459 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
6802460 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
6802461 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
6802462 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while
6802463 but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body
6802464 if i had to hand out a rookie of the year award for hockey blogging for the 2006 07 nhl season one of the top contenders for the award would have to be the forechecker
6802465 since forechecker is the albert einstein of the hockey blogosphere you best believe him
6802466 woes me i am just another employee and i want my severance package
6802467 am like an owner and should reap much of the reward
6802468 die sturm fans haben leuchtraketen und bengalen auf das spielfeld geworfen das steht au er zweifel und es wird konsequenzen f r die verantwortlichen geben
6802469 the withdrawal of all russian troops is going according to plan and we are not going to correct this plan or to increase the speed of the withdrawal
6802470 the president of the united states is on vacation obviously he is not receiving timely information we recommend the presidents press secretary should pay more attention to our press conferences
6802471 most people with allergies are atopic meaning they have a genetic tendency to develop allergies to detect the genetic factors we examined the genomes of more than 10 000 adults and children from the whole of germany
6802472 they do not depict an actual american flag the dncc has full and complete respect for the flag and all rules of display
6802473 you know the truth is that right after 9 11 i had a pin shortly after 9 11 particularly because as were talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest
6802474 in september 2003 kerry implied that voting against wartime funding bills was equivalent to abandoning the troops
6802475 i dont think any united states senator is going to abandon our troops and recklessly leave iraq to whatever follows as a result of simply cutting and running
6802476 then in october 2003 a year after voting to support the use of force in iraq kerry voted against an 87 billion supplemental funding bill for u s troops in iraq and afghanistan he did support an alternative bill that funded the 87 billion by cutting some of president bushs tax cuts
6802477 but when it was apparent the alternative bill would not pass he decided to go on record as not supporting the legislation to fund soldiers
6802478 i actually did vote for the 87 billion before i voted against it
6802479 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
6802480 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
6802481 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
6802482 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
6802483 trichoplax is an ancient lineage a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
6802484 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
6802485 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
6802486 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
6802487 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
6802488 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
6802489 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
6802490 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature
6802491 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
6802492 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
6802493 i dont care how much talent a team has if the boys dont think tough practice tough and live tough how can they play tough on saturday

6802495 i didnt start coming through until i was 20 21 so i think in training and competition years i am quite young i think i am developing and will be in good shape at the age of 29
6802496 it was hard out there and it wasnt to be but the experience has been great
6802497 you may be interested in a government scheme that is not widely published 1 take early retirement using sick days and accumulated days off etc etc 2 with union approval and backing file notice of dispute stating that claimant was underpaid because claimant should have been in a higher category in other words claimant was underpaid because why manager asked questions requested help and relied on claimants years of experience therefore the claimant should have been at the same pay level as manager
6802498 it was very disappointing not to get the gold extremely disappointing not to get the silver but you never pass up on an olympic medal
6802499 he will take a month off for a well earned rest before deciding but at 30 he will still be at a good age to compete
6802500 one of the boys in the estonian crew was 42
6802501 i dont know where the last 250m came from i was in so much pain ive never been in that pain in my entire life
6802502 im so relieved and happy it was not a gimme we were on the ropes and we put together the best finish weve ever had

6802505 i dont know what our chances will be of getting 72 new police officers but any more resources coming into the borough would be a help
6802506 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
6802507 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
6802508 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
6802509 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases
6802510 our study was the first that we know of to systematically review the literature on complication rates of spinal surgery in the elderly population
6802511 given our rapidly increasing numbers of patients over age 65 in the us this is a very relevant topic
6802512 were one of the biggest teams on the planet so its bizarre although we pressed in the second half we fell to another set piece which really sticks in the throat i think weve got enough ability to cope
6802513 we dont want to overreact because weve had a mad 20 minutes
6802514 i thought they overpowered us physically which in a strange way is going to be good because its a lesson learned very early
6802515 its also a message to everyone that were not the chelsea of the championship were not going to romp it as the bookies keep saying its going to be tough to get out of the division
6802516 hopefully the reaction will be good and we cant wait for the next game now to put it right
6802517 we are great with free kicks we get but its a question of tightening up at the other end it was the problem last year and we dont want a repeat
6802518 we are going to work hard at defending corners and freekicks its unbelievably important get that right and you wont go far wrong
6802519 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6802520 we look at all areas of the council but we tend to try to go for administrative back office stuff because we dont want to cut services we try to get as much efficiency as possible from what were doing
6802521 weve set a 10m savings budget and were going to stay with that at the moment and just wait to see how our providers bills turn out for the year ahead we took 16m out in the first year but every year it gets harder because we have to save more and more
6802522 i live opposite and opened my curtains in the morning to see it it was the full length of the church everyone is shocked
6802523 it must have happened in the early hours because my wife woke up at about 2am and it wasnt there then
6802524 ive absolutely no idea why someone would do this i think its disgusting
6802525 this was an act of pure vandalism and were saddened that someone would actively target places of worship in such a manner
6802526 my wife and i were just about to go to bed when we heard a loud bang like an explosion i looked out the window and all i could see was the neighbours car badly damaged but when we went outside i saw this indian guy lying down with cuts and bruises on his head before i saw the land cruiser
6802527 when i looked out he was just getting out the 4x4 he didnt seem to have a mark on him then he took off he ran very fast considering what hed been through
6802528 our car was pushed back a long way and we think its a write off its lucky it didnt happen during the day as someone could have been more badly hurt or worse
6802529 we all know how big the event is so does this mean were going to have to be re housed every year
6802530 if they do end up building flats then people might not be too happy to have such a big event right next to where they live
6802531 the only alternative to doing nothing is to offer a part of the park for redevelopment
6802532 the desire of such property owners for privacy would ensure that their sites could be screened off the rest of the site
6802533 alternative sources of public and private funding and sustainable uses for the park must be found but there is no plan existing to sell off any of the park
6802534 a meeting of the gunnersbury park regeneration board on july 10 discussed ways forward and in particular the development of an options appraisal
6802535 the options appraisal will consider possible uses for the buildings and spaces and will be subject to full public consultation
6802536 if you touch my car i am going to stab you in the eye
6802537 i was scared he poked the knife through the car window and waved it in front of my face and then when i closed the window he stabbed the glass
6802538 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6802539 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

6802544 the only alternative to doing nothing is to offer a part of the park for redevelopment
6802545 the desire of such property owners for privacy would ensure their sites could be screened off from the rest of the site
6802546 i completely oppose this sort of plan the park was given to the public for their benefit by the rothschilds in the 1920s it wasnt given to them just so luxury houses could be built there and a proposal like this is completely unacceptable
6802547 gunnersbury park regeneration board has been meeting behind closed doors and this proves why they obviously know the public wouldnt be happy if they found out about it
6802548 alternative sources of public and private funding and sustainable uses for the park must be found but there is no plan existing to sell off any of the park
6802549 a meeting of the gunnersbury park regeneration board on july 10 discussed ways forward and in particular the development of an options appraisal
6802550 the appraisal will consider possible uses for the buildings and spaces and will be subject to full public consultation so that all issues are considered in the development of a masterplan for the site
6802551 its been good playing alongside alan bennett hes really commanding and a good talker
6802552 and hes probably right when he says i dont talk enough but that will come in time
6802553 im here for experience and to learn about things like that thats the main thing although winnings all the better as well
6802554 im not sure whether theres an option to extend beyond my month here but id be well up for continuing if it means more first team football
6802555 bristol city boss gary johnson told me it would be a great experience playing at brentford and that it was a good opportunity andy scott was giving me
6802556 i was looking to go out on loan this year but this is a higher standard than i was hoping for to be honest
6802557 its been perfect so far the team have surprised me drop ping down two leagues i didnt realise they would be this good
6802558 i think weve got a good chance this year of pushing on
6802559 my speed and my covering are my main strengths but i need to work on my heading
6802560 when i was at millwall it was instilled in us over and over but what you saw today was a lot less than what i used to do im trying to get it out of my game and it has lessened
6802561 im not going to stop it completely because thats the sort of player i am my instinct is to help out at the back but sometimes the manager says im doing it a bit too much at times
6802562 the gaffer has given me the freedom to express myself but ive found myself tracking back when i could say to myself that newts adam newton can do that and i dont really need to be back there
6802563 its a question of getting used to a new way of playing and using my energy going forward rather than back
6802564 i went to yeovil from millwall and had a bad start with injury i needed an ankle operation and was out for three and a half months and i was in and out of the side when i came back
6802565 it was hard being away from home for the first time and at the end of the season i didnt feel the manager was trying his hardest to keep me there
6802566 ive got a little baby on the way too and i felt it wasnt the best to be that far away so when the gaffer came in i didnt think twice about joining
6802567 one of the things that stuck in my head when i met andy scott was that he said he wanted me to go out and express yourself and thats something ive always wanted to do
6802568 to have that feeling on the pitch is something that every player wants i feel im not restricted i think thats helping the team
6802569 i always go out on the pitch wanting to give 110 per cent thats always top of my list and it looks like the fans have seen that and appreciate it
6802570 after disappointing losses at bury and swansea we bounced back well and i hope we can pull out more performances like that
6802571 it gives us great momentum for this weeks game at barnet
6802572 the fact we have someone like alan connell on the bench who scored a dozen goals last season shows the firepower we have in our squad and we feel there are goals in us from midfield too
6802573 we can go into games confident that we have potency going forward
6802574 hes already shown hes got a good relationship with nathan elder
6802575 weve got very good options in the forward department and moses ademola can cover on the right side of midfield
6802576 i think the fans can see weve got a lot more pace and technical ability and a team that enjoys working together
6802577 i thought james wilson was outstanding at the back and alan bennett was excellent hes getting his match fitness and mark phillips has signed
6802578 weve still got a few missing but its going to be a big headache for me when everyones fit
6802579 agree a set of recommendations to shape the health strategy for london for the next 10 years

6802583 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6802584 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6802585 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6802586 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6802587 al pasaje y a la tripulaci n no era una raz n m s que suficiente para hacer algo m s que advertir por carta una y otra vez

6802591 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6802592 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6802593 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6802594 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6802595 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6802596 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6802597 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6802598 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6802599 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6802600 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6802601 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6802602 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6802603 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6802604 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6802605 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6802606 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6802607 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6802608 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6802609 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
6802610 it was a very good win because bishops stortford have beaten some good sides to reach the semis including finchley and ardley green who are the essex premier league champions
6802611 our seamers didnt bowl too well to begin with but our spinners made sure we stayed on top
6802612 playing at home is definitely an advantage and we have to make sure we get 10 points from each of the next two games against two of the weaker teams in the division to maintain or even extend our lead at the top
6802613 we dont really want to go finchley needing a win on the final day
6802614 in the next games we want to show another fulham and im sure the supporters will see another fulham on saturday to the one that played at hull
6802615 its the right time to play arsenal now i like it much more to play against a big team
6802616 im unhappy with the result but its only the first game and we know where we went wrong and its our task to do it better
6802617 in the first half everything was ok and if we had gone home with one point i think that would have been fine but in the second half we gave them too much of the game and allowed them to gain confidence
6802618 i know already absolutely the situation here for the goalkeepers
6802619 its great for me to be here at this great club and i want to be successful but i know mark schwarzer is number one and there is no problem for me
6802620 i want to give my experience to the young players in training thats very important and if the gaffer needs me im sure i will be ready
6802621 he knows me already from years ago with the swiss national team
6802622 after the euros i decided to stop my international career but i felt i could keep going and there were a lot of possibilities to continue in another country and of course after fulham called me it was absolutely fantastic they are a beautiful premier league club
6802623 but im not here to see the nice city of london im here to be successful im professional and want to be always successful whether im playing or not playing
6802624 he wanted to make a new team and it was hard for me that i couldnt show what i could do to the new guy
6802625 to play at home against a big club like that is tough but we can win why not
6802626 they have also a lot of players who are injured and they have a lot of young players who have not played a lot in the last year
6802627 of course ive watched a lot of english football on television and know a lot of arsenal players also from the national team and i know they play good technical football
6802628 i know the gaffer also from arsenal arsene wenger and we know we have to be much more compact than we were against hull in the second half
6802629 if you are not compact enough against arsenal of course you have problems but we have a good spirit on the field
6802630 there is good communication between the players and this is what my work will involve even if i am not playing
6802631 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6802632 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6802633 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6802634 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6802635 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6802636 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6802637 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6802638 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6802639 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6802640 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6802641 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6802642 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6802643 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6802644 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6802645 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6802646 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6802647 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6802648 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6802649 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6802650 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6802651 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6802652 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6802653 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6802654 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6802655 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6802656 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6802657 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6802658 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6802659 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6802660 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6802661 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6802662 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6802663 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6802664 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6802665 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6802666 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6802667 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6802668 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6802669 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6802670 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6802671 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6802675 the country wants a democratic president theyre not sure they want this democrat look whats happened in the last six to eight weeks six to eight weeks ago the question wasnt whether obama would win but by how much
6802676 if he picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty he would have effectively destroyed the republican party and pushed the conservative movement into the bleachers
6802677 lieberman would blow things up that would be like obama picking some right ringer that agrees with him on one thing

6802819 generic host process for win32 services has encountered a problem and needs to close
6802820 we decided to launch negotiations with the current palestinian leadership in ramallah because it is important to reach an agreement with the pragmatic moderates
6802821 a better understanding of the sensitivities and what is important to them and i discovered that they are very suspicious when it comes to israel
6802822 we have started to draft part of the agreement and i also hope they know more about israeli concerns
6802823 a timeline is important but even more important is the content any attempt to bridge the gap between israeli and palestinian negotiators which is premature to bridge or any attempt to avoid the comprehensive agreement we want to reach can lead to clashes misunderstandings and violence
6802824 here i represent not only the israeli government but also the palestinians and if we can reach agreement the international community should respect it we are working on a comprehensive agreement on the core issues which will give answers to the concerns of both sides
6802825 the aspiration of the palestinians is to have a state that includes the gaza strip
6802826 i would be blamed of doing something against the palestinian interest this is what we were accused of before our withdrawal from gaza in 2005
6802827 something that belongs to the past two states is in israel s interest and represents the will not only of the government but of the entire israeli people
6802828 everybody is using the formula and this is the basic understanding between israel and the palestinians two states for two peoples
6802829 this is the raison d etre of the state of israel
6802830 the answer to the palestinian refugee problem is the creation of a palestinian state
6802831 but unfortunately some arab and palestinian leaders are calling for two states but also demanding the right of return to israel which is the jewish state this is not a theoretical question this is the basic understanding between the two negotiating teams and this is one of the two basic pillars the other of course is israels security
6802832 the borders should not be vague or say only 1967 lines plus or minus a percentage no we need outlines on the map so that the day after the agreement there will be no misunderstanding
6802833 it is important to know what will be on the other side of these borders and to know that it s demilitarized
6802834 we have no hidden agenda a future palestinian state includes the west bank and gaza this is the palestinian aspiration but in order to create a state they need to give an answer to the situation on the ground
6802835 the lebanon war could have been ended in a few days if it had just been between states
6802836 the israeli prime minister needs to understand the threats and trends in the region preparation is needed and not only of the army there are different options and the prime minister needs to put on the table what is the goal of israel what are the options and to choose from then then and only then we the political leadership should ask our military experts what is best after already choosing between the options

6802861 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6802862 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6802863 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6802864 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

6802868 appointed by the home office in june 2007 to provide application support for tracking prolific and other priority offenders through the criminal justice system
6802869 data from the police national computer containing personal information about 33 000 individuals with six or more recordable convictions in the last 12 months names addresses and dates of birth data relating to approximately 10 000 prolific and other priority offenders names and dates of birth but not addresses data relating to all 84 000 prisoners in england and wales names dates of birth and in some cases expected prison release date and date of home detention curfew and drug interventions programme data with offenders initials but not full names
6802870 deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6802871 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6802872 it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times

6802905 there is no charge to become a friend of the park but this will greatly assist us in showing the heritage lottery fund and the gannochy trust the level of community support for the project
6802906 we are sure that any funding received will be well spent on a range of improvements that people in strathearn and beyond will benefit from
6802907 instead of a hot meal several days a week recipients will be given two weeks worth of frozen dishes if a recipient isnt able to prepare the dish then someone will be sent along to help if a recipient doesnt have a freezer or microwave these will be provided
6802908 the loss of contact on a daily basis is the real crux of the matter
6802909 the council asked about three months ago if i would be happy to have frozen meals i told them straight if they go frozen forget it for the simple reason i dont have a big enough freezer
6802910 is that i like the company if they drop meals off once a fortnight then thatll be all theyll be doing they wont really be coming to talk to you
6802911 meals delivery can be a vital service for those who want to maintain independence in their homes
6802912 hot or frozen meals or a mixture of the two according to requirements are delivered and we can provide freezers and microwaves if they are needed
6802913 our home meals service provides friendly social contact for those who may be confined to the house and a regular check that they are safe and well
6802914 we are committed to making the new service work for everyone who needs it and so are taking time to examine thoroughly all aspects of how the new service will operate
6802915 our service users will be the first to be informed when we reach the stage of agreeing an implementation date we will ensure that everyone using the service is fully prepared and supported for the introduction of the new service
6802916 apetito already provides a similar meals service in 13 other local authority areas where surveys have been carried out with service users satisfaction levels are extremely high
6802917 we are also in constructive discussions with the wrvs about their continued involvement in supporting people
6802918 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6802919 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6802920 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6802921 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6802922 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6802923 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6802924 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6802925 theres nothing weaker than speaker merkley passing the buck on his fundamental responsibility
6802926 as speaker of the house merkley led the oversight of the capitol redecorating project its bad enough that hes hiding under his desk its worse that hes trying to pull others down there with him
6802927 this renovation may include improving electrical and plumbing systems safeguarding technology cables improving fire suppression systems stabilizing hvac conditions for the current number of wing occupants improving ada accessibility and improving office space and furnishings
6802928 when committee and commission members discussed this recommendation it was stressed that the capitol is the peoples building and that the physical condition of the capitol calls for repairs
6802929 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either
6802930 the bronze medal may not be important from a brazilians point of view but in the future we will be proud
6802931 we deserve respect as a group of players because we took some criticism after the defeat to argentina

6802951 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
6802952 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
6802953 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears
6802954 the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all

6802961 the bankrupt saakashvili regime to the detriment of partnership its not our fault
6802962 the loss of a home community and security during a natural disaster such as katrina only magnifies the loss of a sense of place
6802963 reestablishing a sense of place and subsequently place attachment among both returning and new residents is paramount to the citys future success
6802964 in the aftermath of katrina most of the population that contributed to the citys world class culture remains in diaspora with former residents in nearly every state
6802965 the culture of new orleans is very much at risk when the people who make and preserve it are scattered and living in a sea of uncertainty and when the places where artists and traditional bearers live where they make and practice their art forms are largely destroyed
6802966 that is lacking in other places across the nation recognition that root culture matters
6802967 when you have no one there to make a place in this space whos going to make the gumbo you have to have a cultural sense of place
6802968 because culture will be an economic stimulus and possibly the most relied on sector in the region business and city planners will have to avoid the occurrence of disneyfication of the urban and social environments
6802969 exposed the social issues of segregation poverty and minority marginalization
6802970 the storm has virtually created a blank slate for the city almost as if the city was wiped from the earth and another city was built on its ruins
6802971 the society and culture of new orleans may never be the same again
6802972 as different people bring cultural and ethnic values of the city the cultural landscape will change to be more inclusive
6802973 the physical landscape is the foundation for other landscape development because it presents the natural characteristics that society employs
6802974 we need to take steps to reeducate and rebuild our connection with the natural world as opposed to attempting to conquer it
6802975 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6802976 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6802977 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6802978 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6802979 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6802980 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6802981 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6802982 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6802983 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6802984 as long as the gain outweighs the cost the feature will survive the fruit flys color pattern is a paradigm for understanding how to use the same sets of genes in different sexes to come up with different features

6802991 we must congratulate all the people here in valencia for the job they have done
6802992 they have made a fantastic job here and i think the valencia track will have a big place in the future for formula one
6802993 the track is good its a typical street track in that the rubbered line builds up very quickly but then off line you have much less grip
6802994 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
6802995 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes
6802996 with more attention than ever before being focused on understanding our planets climate weather systems and atmosphere its important that scientists challenge their own assumptions and current theories of how these complex processes work i think our study sheds new light on the driving forces behind the weather in the mid latitudes

6803005 these cases and outbreaks serve as a reminder that measles can and still does occur in the united states
6803006 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief

6803026 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6803027 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6803028 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6803029 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6803030 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6803031 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6803032 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6803033 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6803034 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6803035 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6803036 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6803037 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6803038 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6803039 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
6803040 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
6803041 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
6803042 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
6803043 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen
6803044 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6803045 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
6803046 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6803047 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6803048 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict an example is sudans darfur province where an ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
6803049 although climate change bears a significant conflict potential it can also transform the international system toward more cooperation if it is seen as a common threat that requires joint action
6803050 the bali roadmap has many good ideas but was criticized as being too vague to induce a major policy shift
6803051 nevertheless the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
6803052 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
6803053 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
6803054 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline
6803055 riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
6803056 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
6803057 global warming receives now more public and political attention than a few years ago
6803058 grass roots movements are emerging in the united states for protecting the climate and developing energy alternatives involving not only many local communities and companies but also influential states such as california led by gov arnold schwarzenegger
6803059 congressional and presidential candidates now acknowledge that something has to be done to play a leading role on energy and climate change to not fall behind the rest of the world

6803105 a lot of them have quite a bit of combat experience
6803106 well have been out here for two weeks on saturday
6803107 we just have to take it one day at a time
6803108 em uma cidade segura n o se morre de picada de mosquito

6803111 your own story and the american story are not separate they are shared and they will both be enriched if we stand up together and answer a new call to service to meet the challenges of our new century i wont just ask for your vote as a candidate i will ask for your service and your active citizenship when i am president of the united states this will not be a call issued in one speech or program this will be a cause of my presidency
6803112 our individual stories and the grand american story are not separate they are one and the same this month this principle will be at the heart of the democratic national convention as barack accepts the partys nomination for president of the united states
6803113 last year 60 million americans spent over 8 billion hours volunteering in their communities today one in four americans give their time and their talents to serving others weve seen the power of volunteering firsthand in this campaign millions of people have worked the phones and pounded the pavement to get out the vote for barack
6803114 it is in that spirit of unity that the democratic national convention will launch delegate service day
6803115 weve both seen the impact that only service can achieve whether by working to increase resources for mental health in colorado or preparing young people for careers in public service in chicago weve each witnessed the ripples of change that begin by serving others
6803116 our nation is built on a history of service written by generations of soldiers and sailors suffragists and freedom riders teachers and doctors police officers and firefighters their lesson to us is simple but profound in america each of us is free to seek our own dreams but we must also serve a common and higher purpose
6803117 and she ran past me chasing that rabbit she went through the fence into the thick brush in the park
6803118 manusia hidup bukan untuk makan tapi manusia butuh makan untuk tetap hidup
6803119 given fannie maes and freddie macs importance to the u s mortgage market we believe there is a very high level of support for their debt from the u s treasury
6803120 and given these government sponsored entities more limited ability to raise capital and grow their portfolio to accomplish their public policy role in a time of mortgage market turmoil we believe that theres an increased probability of actual support coming from the u s treasury
6803121 im sorry we need to go in now kegan needs a break
6803122 thats fine as long as youre taking care of them

6803131 the market need for mobile broadband services has increased significantly in recent years
6803132 softbank and other mobile operators who have deployed wcdma networks believe that hspa satisfies these requirements because of its efficient spectrum usage as well as cost effectiveness for capacity expansion
6803133 this is a significant achievement for hspa and clear confirmation that it will be the dominant mobile broadband technology for the foreseeable future
6803134 in addition we anticipate that growth will be driven by the sub 35 age range 15 to 20 year olds now who have been brought up with a mobile for as long as they can remember broadband at home and digital multichannel tv

6803169 global brands want to tap into chinas consumer market so theyll be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the olympics
6803170 that was part of the idea of having the games in china opening new markets for the olympics
6803171 all of our planning has been geared toward the scale of our coverage of the olympics
6803172 weve got programs looking at high tech shoes and swimsuits telling the stories of olympians past and present and a show called rivals which looks at whos the no 1 american no 1 kenyan we want to cover the games from an international perspective not just a chinese perspective
6803173 their revenues look rather small for a company that is a fusion of abc

6803181 when i watched the stv competition advert it was clear they were looking for more edgy artists not your usual sort of thing which attracted me to it and i thought my music could stand a good chance of being considered i was speechless when i got the phone call telling me i had won which was a first for me im so excited to be supporting digitalism itll be the biggest act i have supported to date plus i love their music which makes it even more special when i perform live i lose myself in my music but ill be dripping with sweat at the end

6803190 i love going down there i try to make it a priority and im bummed i cant get there now
6803191 gas prices were definitely a factor in our decision to close as we saw that musicians and patrons alike were scaling back due to those costs
6803192 especially the musicians driving around the state or flying on the beleaguered airlines so patrons wallets were under pressure and our costs were going up not a successful combination of events
6803193 too rich for my blood theyre not coming you get a lot more people asking for guarantees now
6803194 in the midwest or up north you drive in a radius because youve got a lot of cities that are all around other cities
6803195 artists tend to work it out but with stuff going up gas prices cut into your pay bands are gonna be car pooling soon
6803196 people here wont always go see bands they dont know theyre not as adventurous in general and its tough to get peoples attention now they dont have as much money and are less inclined to spend it on something theyre not sure of
6803197 actually quit djing because of the high gas prices i live in jupiter farms and have to travel
6803198 the clubs cant compensate me for the travel and im basically paying for myself to dj
6803199 to drive an hour and a half and not make any money is stupid
6803200 you are just a dreamer the way you talk i dont think you will ever get any were with your life you are supposed to put your family first not poor me
6803201 if i let her shed sit in my lap and have me read books to her all day
6803202 yesterday is history and tomorrow is a mistery so focus on the present
6803203 theres no greater love than the one sheds his blood for his friends
6803204 a hundred times every day i remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men living and dead and that i must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as i have received and am still receiving
6803205 anyone can cath your eye but it takes somone truly special to catch your heart

6803208 we all begin with good intent love was raw and young we believed that we could change ourselves the past could be undone but we carry on our backs the burden time always reveals the lonely light of morning the wound that would not heal its the bitter taste of losing everything that i have held so dear

6803210 if you trust every web site but not a government

6803212 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6803213 pencalonan artis dalam legislator merupakan perwajahan masyarakat indonesia saat ini yang hanya melihat seseorang dari kepopuleran figur
6803214 masyarakat akan semakin tidak percaya terhadap parpol dan proses demokratisasi di negeri ini karena hanya mereka yang populer yang dapat duduk menjadi wakil rakyat padahal kenyataannya tidak mampu bekerja mengemban amanat rakyat
6803215 selain itu yang juga mengkhawatirkan adalah untuk proses pendewasaan demokrasi karena untuk menentukan wakil rakyat tidak mengukur kapasitas dan kredibilitas tetapi hanya berdasarkan popularitas semata
6803216 banyak artis yang masuk dalam daftar caleg dari sejumlah parpol sebelumnya tidak memiliki kepedulian serta kemampuan dalam berorganisasi dan kegiatan sosial lainnya sehingga mereka kurang teruji
6803217 kemudian pada saat terpilih mereka justru tidak dapat berbuat apa apa atau berbuat sesuatu yang berarti bagi rakyat
6803218 kasus ini sedang ditangani oleh provos kami berinisiatif mengusut informasi ini tanpa perlu menunggu laporan dari pihak lain

6803237 the evidence on record are sufficient to support a finding of probable cause for the commission of syndicated estafa and that herein respondents as responsible corporate officers had decided upon carried out and implemented the felonious acts complained of resulting in the misappropriation of funds which had been solicited collected by meralco from members of the general public desiring to engage its services as a distribution utility
6803238 were saddened and surprised by this development the doj decision was issued with undue haste and in violation of the law our executives were denied due process denied the right to file their counteraffidavits
6803239 the investigation was interrupted or suspended by the makati regional trial court tro the respondents were not informed that the case had been submitted for resolution so they were not able to submit their counteraffidavits

6803242 maka dia tersenyum dengan tertawa karena mendengar perkataan semut itu
6803243 ya tuhanku berilah aku ilham untuk tetap mensyukuri nikmat mu yang telah engkau anugerahkan kepadaku dan kepada dua orang ibu bapakku dan untuk mengerjakan amal saleh yang engkau ridhai dan masukkanlah aku dengan rahmat mu ke dalam golongan hamba hamba mu yang saleh
6803244 sejak aku masuk islam rasulullah saw tidak pernah menghindar dariku dan beliau tidak melihatku kecuali beliau pasti tersenyum kepadaku
6803245 wahai muhammad perintahkan sahabatmu memberikan harta dari baitul maal muhammad saw menoleh kepadanya seraya tersenyum kemudian beliau menyuruh sahabatnya memberi harta dari baitul maal kepadanya
6803246 saya mendatangi muhammad saw ketika saya mengucapkan salam kepadanya beliau tersenyum senyuman orang yang marah
6803247 kemari maka saya mendekati beliau dan duduk di depan beliau
6803248 ketika kaum muslimin berada dalam shalat fajar di hari senin sedangkan abu bakar menjadi imam mereka ketika itu mereka dikejutkan oleh muhammad saw yang membuka hijab kamar aisyah beliau melihat kaum muslimin sedang dalam shaf shalat kemudian beliau tersenyum kepada mereka
6803249 wajah merupakan cermin yang tepat bagi perasaan hati seseorang wajah yang ceria penuh senyuman alami senyum tulus adalah sebaik baik sarana memperoleh teman dan kerja sama dengan pihak lain senyum lebih berharga dibanding sebuah pemberian yang dihadiahkan seorang pria dan lebih menarik dari lipstik dan bedak yang menempel di wajah seorang wanita senyum bukti cinta tulus dan persahabatan yang murni
6803250 saya minta setiap mahasiswa saya untuk tersenyum kepada orang tertentu sekali setiap pekannya
6803251 saya pilih tersenyum kepada istriku ia tidak tau sama sekali perihal ini hasilnya adalah saya menemukan kebahagiaan baru yang sebelumnya tidak saya rasakan sepanjang akhir tahun tahun ini yang demikian menjadikan saya senang tersenyum setiap kali bertemu dengan orang setiap orang membalas penghormatan kepada saya dan bersegera melaksanakan khidmat pelayanan terhadap saya karena itu saya merasakan hidup lebih ceria dan lebih mudah
6803252 ingatlah bahwa senyum tidak membutuhkan biaya sedikitpun akan tetapi membawa dampak yang luar biasa tidak akan menjadi miskin orang yang memberinya justeru akan menambah kaya bagi orang yang mendapatkannya senyum juga tidak memerlukan waktu yang bertele tele namun membekas kekal dalam ingatan sampai akhir hayat tidak ada seorang fakir yang tidak memilikinya dan tidak ada seorang kaya pun yang tidak membutuhkannya
6803253 duhai teman teman seperjuanganku yang insya allah terus tetap tegar tegak n pantang menyerah dalam membela kebenaran islam jika hanya dengan senyum kita dapat mempererat kerjasama maka marilah dengan senyum itu pula kita bersama sama untuk tetap berdiri kokoh dalam ajaran isalam yang benar
6803254 dianjurkan bagi setiap orang yang mendapatkan kebaikan dan diangkat dari dirinya keburukan untuk bersujud kepada allah sebagai tanda syukur dan memuji allah dengan pujian yang sesuai dengan keagungannya
6803255 telah datang kepada kalian bulan ramadan bulan yang penuh berkah allah telah mewajibkan kepada kalian untuk berpuasa pada bulan itu allah membuka pintu pintu surga dan menutup pintu pintu neraka
6803256 tetapi jikalau mereka benar terhadap allah niscaya yang demikian itu lebih baik bagi mereka
6803257 tanyakanlah kepada orang orang yang berilmu jika kamu tiada mengetahui
6803258 dan bertaubatlah kamu sekalian kepada allah hai orang orang yang beriman supaya kamu beruntung
6803259 smoga allah senantiasa memberikan kita kekuatan terutama untuk bisa menjalani ibadah
6803260 masing masing mereka merencanakan untuk minun air sebelum tidur dalam jumlah yang banyak agar bisa bangun dan keluar ke wc
6803261 mereka baru masuk islam cinta di hati mereka demikian kuat ada apa gerangan
6803262 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
6803263 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
6803264 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
6803265 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
6803266 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
6803267 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
6803268 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
6803269 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
6803270 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
6803271 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
6803272 hai orang orang yang beriman bertakwalah kepada allah sebenar benar takwa kepada nya dan janganlah sekali kali kamu mati melainkan dalam keadaan beragama islam
6803273 tidak wajar bagi seseorang manusia yang allah berikan kepadanya al kitab hikmah dan kenabian lalu dia berkata kepada manusia
6803274 hendaklah kamu menjadi orang orang rabbani karena kamu selalu mengajarkan al kitab dan disebabkan kamu tetap mempelajarinya
6803275 beliau saw membantu kerjaan keluarganya tetapi jika datang waktu sholat maka bangkit untuk sholat
6803276 kami diutus allah bagi orang orang yang mau untuk membebaskan manusia dari penyembahan pada manusia menuju penyembahan pada rabb manusia dari kezhaliman agama agama menuju keadilan islam dan dari sempitnya dunia menuju luasnya dunia dan akhirat
6803277 hendaklah kamu menjadi orang orang rabbani karena kamu selalu mengajarkan al kitab dan disebabkan kamu mempelajarinya
6803278 ketika pendeta dan rahib dari nashrani dan yahudi najran berkumpul bersama rasulullah saw maka rasul saw mengajak mereka masuk islam
6803279 wahai muhammad apakah engkau menginginkan kami menyembahmu sebagaimana nashrani menyembah isa
6803280 maha suci allah kami menyembah selain allah atau menyuruh menyembah selain allah bukan untuk itu aku diutus dan diperintah
6803281 tidak layak bagi orang beriman memerintahkan manusia menyembah para dai dari orang beriman
6803282 karena dahulu suatu kaum satu sama lain saling menyembah yaitu bahwa ahli kitab menyembah pendeta dan rahib mereka sebagaimana disebutkan dalam
6803283 ya sesungguhnya mereka menghalalkan yang haram dan mengharamkan yang halal dan ahli kitab mengikutinya itulah ibadah ahli kitab kepada pendeta dan rahib
6803284 warna celupan allah siapakah yang paling baik warnanya melebihi warna allah dan kami beribadah kepada nya
6803285 siapa yang tidak memperhatikan urusan umat islam maka bukan golongan mereka
6803286 sesungguhnya tidak ada islam kecuali dengan jamaah tidak ada jamaah kecuali dengan imarah tidak ada imarah kecuali dengan taat dan tidak ada taat kecuali dengan baiat
6803287 islam tanpa ditopang dengan sistem maka akan dikalahkan oleh kebatilan yang ditopang dengan sistem
6803288 kalau rabbmu menghendaki maka dia menjadikan manusia umat yang satu tetapi mereka senantiasa berselisih kecuali yang dirahmati oleh rabbmu
6803289 allah tidak menyatukan umat ini pada kesesatan dan tangan allah bersama jamaah
6803290 dan allahlah yang yang menyatukan hati hati orang beriman jika engkau infakkan seluruh kekayaan yang ada di muka bumi engkau tidak dapat menyatukan hati hati orang beriman tetapi allahlah yang menyatukan hati hati mereka sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa dan bijaksana wahai nabi cukuplah bagimu allah dan orang orang yang mengikuti dari orang beriman
6803291 bahkan mereka tidak mendapatkan perlindungan seperti yang tercantum dalam konvensi jenewa
6803292 lambat laun aku sadar bahwa usahaku untuk memberikan pengajaran tentang toleransi membuat kecurigaan mereka semakin dalam
6803293 mereka tidak peduli pangkatku kapten lulusan west point akademi militer paling bergengsi di amerika serikat mereka tidak peduli agamaku melarang telanjang di hadapan orang mereka tidak peduli belum ada dakwaan resmi terhadapku mereka tidak peduli istri dan anak anakku tidak mengetahui keberadaanku mereka pun jelas tidak peduli kalau aku adalah warga amerika yang setia dan di atas segalanya tidak bersalah
6803294 mereka tidak mempertimbangkan bahwa aku adalah seorang prajurit yang setia

6803307 it s always interesting to see whether books get tucked under the heading of entertainment or life at blogs com the answer is neither while the web is positively awash in book related blogs there s no place to find them at this hot new hub there isn t even a single top 10 list on the subject
6803308 we will definitely feature book blogs and book related top ten lists as soon as possible back when we launched typepad five years ago the built in category list had tv movies and music all in one category and books all by themselves as a company all about helping people share words and with a flagship product that s actually called movable type we d be crazy not to love books

6803369 los resultados no son importantes sino el trabajo t ctico y f sico que se est haciendo quien quiera buscar los resultados en la pretemporada se equivoca
6803370 hemos trabajado aspectos t cnicos y t cticos y se ha visto que el equipo va a m s tiene confianza y sabe a qu juega tenemos ganas de comenzar ya de que empiece lo bueno

6803375 me gusta mucho esta carrera porque soy de madrid y no tengo muchas oportunidades de correr en casa y de subir unos puertos en los que suelo entrenarme me hace una ilusi n enorme

6803384 it doesnt hit you right away that youre off prison ground until youre sitting there at night and you see the stars above you
6803385 it was a shock just leaving the prison uncuffed after being transported from regional to regional shackled and cuffed you know it was kind of a different feeling

6803390 the deer lodge crew is a benefit because its overall cost is less than federal crews
6803391 this crew can very often get to a fire while its still in the initial attack phase and thus have the opportunity to keep it a smaller and less expensive fire in many instances i think the crew is more productive than others
6803392 while some crews will lose their focus and commitment during the later stages of a fire sometimes even requesting release to their home unit the deer lodge crew is more than happy to stay throughout the tedious mop up stages of a fire they continue to work hard dont complain about adverse conditions and remain productive because they are in no hurry to go home and want to do well so they get ordered again for the next fire
6803393 those guys will bend backwards before screwing up ive never had a problem with them

6803409 every mother and father should look in the mirror and ask themselves if they are doing the parenting essential to help their child negotiate the difficult teen years free of tobacco alcohol and drugs
6803410 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation it is inexcusable that so many parents fail to appropriately monitor their children fail to keep dangerous prescription drugs out of the reach of their children and tolerate drug infected schools the parents who smoke marijuana with children should be considered child abusers by identifying the characteristics of problem parents we seek to identify the actions that parents can take and avoid in order to become part of the solution and raise healthy drug free children

6803426 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
6803427 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
6803428 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
6803429 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
6803430 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
6803431 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
6803432 dont interfere with anything in the constitution that must be maintained for it is the only safeguard of our liberties

6803444 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
6803445 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
6803446 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was

6803463 if something occurs in front of us were going to act
6803464 we expect police to abide by this very logical recommendation
6803465 if police expect the taxpayers to cover their 1 2 million in overtime during the dnc it is only fair that they respect the laws adopted by those taxpayers
6803466 there will be plenty for police to do during the dnc aside from arresting or citing adults who are simply making the safer choice to use marijuana instead of alcohol

6803490 on september 11 1857 mormon settlers in southern utah used a false flag of truce to lull a group of california bound emigrants from their circled wagons and then slaughter them when the killing was over more than one hundred butchered bodies lay strewn across a half mile stretch of upland meadow most of the victims were women and children
6803491 blood of the prophets brigham young and the massacre at mountain meadows
6803492 under the banner of heaven a story of violent faith
6803493 this book rests on the most thorough research on the mountain meadows massacre thats ever been conducted
6803494 weve done research from the northeast to southern california from the pacific northwest to the southeast
6803495 there is documentation on top of documentation on top of documentation and that we havent had before
6803496 its probably the most documented work of any in utah history
6803497 the land will be left undeveloped to preserve the sanctity of that hallowed area and out of respect for those who died there
6803498 i always look for the footnotes and the endnotes to see what the sources of information are
6803499 we found sufficient evidence to convince us that the planning took place in the cedar city area
6803500 if you do your job whatever your background whatever your deep feelings and sympathies might be
6803501 who realized that they had to do this that it had to be faced
6803502 there was no one else around my father said nothing i said nothing we simply stood here and thought of what occurred here in 1857 the rock cairn was here weeds rustled in the breeze we walked back to our car without speaking we knew this ground was hallowed and we were reverent and respectful
6803503 all who knew firsthand about what occurred here are long since gone let the book of the past be closed let peace come into our hearts
6803504 the churchs history library and archives as well as the archives of the first presidency the churchs highest governing body church leaders supported our book by providing full and open disclosure
6803505 a small but secure room in the church administration building that housed records of the first presidency as well as a small collection of historical records and artifacts most of which came into the first presidencys possession when joseph fielding smith jr
6803506 we believe it is our obligation to understand and learn from the past
6803507 the book they are writing is nearly complete and will be published in coming months by oxford university press under the title massacre at mountain meadows
6803508 full access to all relevant materials held by the church
6803509 the authors have accurately stated that this is not a formal church account and that they the authors are solely responsible for the content and conclusions in the book
6803510 we had weekly meetings in which we would discuss our interpretation i thought that was one of the strengths of the collaboration that we were able to challenge each other
6803511 you know that two or three witnesses can see things differently
6803512 if you were to try to collect all of the journals of all of the people who saw that game in the stadium
6803513 is that unlike with many other areas of latter day saint history where the historical fabric is very rich here we had this huge tear or hole
6803514 the people who participated in the massacre became ashamed of their participation and destroyed evidence
6803515 we scoured oral histories we tried to find the indian point of view in records from the white mans culture
6803516 the first article i published on joseph smith in a church magazine
6803517 deep suspicion that nothing coming out of the church historians office is trustworthy
6803518 we are encouraged by the response from readers to date and want to assure stores and customers alike that more books are on the way
6803519 the book really is a primer about how men and women might live their lives
6803520 we hope that the story of the massacre will reach right into the essentials of human conduct
6803521 along with enthusiastic sentiments of investors the repo service will undoubtedly help raise the markets liquidity
6803522 we can say the economy has rallied but we cant say it has recovered thus a cautious process is necessary to avoid unexpected losses
6803523 we need longer to offer it to all kinds of customers when the market has truly recovered
6803524 i felt we needed this in our city because the other areas were all getting their own ordinances and these people were going to filter down into the smaller cities
6803525 we were really interested in making sure our children were safe and protecting them and were thinking this would be probably one way we could enhance that
6803526 we thought it would be wise to be on the cutting edge rather than dragging our feet and not protecting our city
6803527 i think our people and our children in this area should have the right to say who lives next door to them and has contact with their children

6803560 from the direction of gori three armored vehicles are moving in our direction plus two trucks loaded with personnel and they passed us and went in the direction of igoeti i asked one of the russian officers at the checkpoint who was wearing a peacekeeping armband and he said they dont intend to stay for long when i asked him to be more concrete he said we are waiting for orders i cant tell you anything my boss is general borisov
6803561 yesterday august 21 general borisov had a fairly heated discussion with gori regional governor vladimer vardzelashvili about the so called buffer zone
6803562 borisov had all kinds of maps out and was referring to the 1992 cease fire agreement which stipulates that the conflict zone included quite a lot of villages north of gori in gori district including two villages that are located along the main east west highway shavshvebi and agara so if we go with that agreement it would mean that the so called peacekeepers who would replace the regular russian troops will have the right to control the main highway and even establish checkpoints
6803563 boyd was there in the squad david clarkson was there stephen fletcher and they are all good young strikers
6803564 boyds record at club record is very good there is a role there but james mcfadden and kenny miller are experienced players and james has an excellent goalscoring ratio and kenny does step up to the plate at internationals and his pace through the middle extends the team gives you depth and links the team
6803565 so he boyd is going to have to go some to get into the team
6803566 kris boyd cannot get fit i thought this summer kris boyd was going to be the new slimmed down kris boyd i mean his scoring record in modern terms is phenomenal its something like 75 in 110 games for rangers and for scotland i think it is something like eight in 14 but the guy cannot get fit
6803567 ive argued the case for kris boyd if youve scored 75 goals in 110 games for rangers then you would argue that your club manager should build your team around that potent weapon
6803568 but paul le guen looked at him and said he cant do it and walter smith has looked at him and to be blunt about it has said no hes not a priority for the team
6803569 now hes got this record why do these managers not use him and hes come back after the summer and he does not look 100 percent fit
6803570 i think at the time i probably knew in my heart of hearts it probably wasnt the right move
6803571 i dont want to disrespect the club ive just left too much but they knew in the first few months i really struggled with it
6803572 they were great with me the staff in the background were great but i think in my heart of hearts i knew it wasnt the club i wanted to play for and now obviously this move has come back and im really happy
6803573 id rather be adding to the squad than subtracting as it were
6803574 shaun i think came down and first of all hes been away from glasgow for about 18 months there was definitely a bit of homesickness early on but i think he got over that
6803575 it is silly shes in no way my muse but she is one of the great american actresses
6803576 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls

6803596 though we do not admit liability we chose to settle this case because we are and have been firmly committed to the well being of our residents
6803597 litigation is a long expensive process that would take our focus away from where it belongs on our residents

6803624 we are replacing our static per keyword quality scores with a system that will evaluate an ads quality each time it matches a search query this way adwords will use the most accurate specific and up to date performance information when determining whether an ad should be displayed
6803625 your ads will be more likely to show when theyre relevant and less likely to show when theyre not this means that google users are apt to see better ads while you as an advertiser should receive leads which are more highly qualified
6803626 were replacing minimum bids with a new more meaningful metric first page bids first page bids are an estimate of the bid it would take for your ad to reach the first page of search results on google web search
6803627 well you know i think its a different time and a different place obviously
6803628 four years ago when i spoke i was speaking as somebody who was in a supportive role to the nominee because i was new i was presenting my version of the american story this time im the nominee so its a different different role
6803629 a pretty good sense of what im going to say
6803630 i suspect that that element of surprise that came about four years ago nobody had heard of me and then i come up and i give a you know a speech that was well received i think that theres a special moment there that were not going to recapture
6803631 at this point people know that i can give a speech and you know theyll see me coming
6803632 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked

6803635 the kinds of meaning and order that we may find in works of art i suspect rarely duplicate those that the artists who made them might find most artists dont concentrate on the past and hope that their work gives us a sense of the present

6803733 completely committed to the traditional distribution model with retail locations staffed by professionals who know their product and know how to service their clients delivering consultative and high touch service
6803734 that is our model and we see online as a marketing tool the web site is for marketing and people are for selling
6803735 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
6803736 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
6803737 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
6803738 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
6803739 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god
6803740 the need to speed up work on the cases followed by olaf and improve communication
6803741 it is hard to compete at an olympic level when you do not get any support from the government
6803742 we need to improve and reform several sectors in cambodias education programs
6803743 part of this improvement should be in sports education which is an important part of the personal development of young people who are the future of our nation people have the tendency to forget cambodia is a nation on the rise and need to give it some time to grow
6803744 if we could get sponsored we could go somewhere with sports in cambodia but the government is not going to support us because they are busy with other things
6803745 i work really hard but do not even have the basic things i need like nutritious food to eat or clothes for training
6803746 the government needs to reform sports and give it a more reliable structure
6803747 from supporting the training and finances of an olympic athlete to building industrial parks and helping cambodia become a leading rice exporter we want to invest in areas that cambodians take pride in
6803748 the next five years will be the time investment takes off in cambodia and the country starts to put itself on the map
6803749 you will see a major change in the country and things like sports which have been overlooked because of the lack of government support may start to receive some funding from the private sector
6803750 i would not have gotten a good education if it had not been for the foreigners who came to my village and started a school
6803751 the days of the khmer rouge are over now and the youth in cambodia face different challenges like how to become socially conscious and have a voice in the development of their country
6803752 cambodia is not competitive in sports education or most jobs right now because we dont have any competition and little opportunity in the country
6803753 but i think with the right support this could change
6803754 i lived in cambodia for five years in the early 90s
6803755 the city has transformed with buildings paved roads and soon skyscrapers but what has not changed that much are the schools i would like to know how much investment is going back in to education
6803756 for example as investors build more hotels in the country others may start to invest in hotel management schools and language schools cambodia will gradually produce more skilled english speaking workers
6803757 being an athlete and just trying to live in cambodia is not easy
6803758 but i think in several years it could get better

6803765 they showed him their warrant cards which caused him to run off and they saw him spit something out of his mouth
6803766 another way to say this is that whenever there is
6803767 remain determined to do their utmost to ensure that justice is rendered to the cambodian people as speedily as possible
6803768 may prevent the trial chamber from fully accounting for duchs criminal responsibility
6803769 for his responsibility as a co perpetrator for a significant number of crimes that occurred as part of a joint criminal enterprise inside
6803770 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6803771 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6803772 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6803773 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6803774 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6803775 this is the weakest quarterly performance since the drop in world trade in the final quarter of 2001
6803776 the only possible system for any city is buses you can have some rail but its impossible for rail to go all over the city even in london which has 8 000 km of rail 50 more people use buses in bogota it was simply the most cost effective scheme
6803777 they take space away from cars and operators like minibus taxis so its easier to put in some rail
6803778 its impossible to solve traffic problems by building more roads you cannot build yourself out of a traffic jam fifty years ago this is what the big cities of the world did they thought they had to build cities for cars not for people now they are realising that it is not the way to go
6803779 by giving priority to public transport over private cars you send out a powerful symbol that public good has priority over private interests

6803785 we are confident that our revised strategy and actions will improve shareholder value in fy09 and beyond
6803786 with fy08 pre announced this result was always about clues that could influence views on managements ability to hit fy09f guidance
6803787 at first glance we cant see any significant developments that should lead to changes in fy09 earnings
6803788 we have known for a long time that he could run
6803789 he was always very quick as a junior and then he dropped away for a couple of years hes back in a big way now
6803790 every once in a while a guy comes along so special i know i have done it clean so why not someone else if i can do it coming from namibia then others can too
6803791 he is just having fun out there hes not talking against anybody or anything
6803792 the jamaicans have one of the best junior programs in the world
6803793 when an infant dies a female will sometimes carry it round for a number of days grooming it and exhibiting stressful behaviour
6803794 i think at the time i probably knew in my heart of hearts it probably wasnt the right move
6803795 i dont want to disrespect the club ive just left too much but they knew in the first few months i really struggled with it
6803796 they were great with me the staff in the background were great but i think in my heart of hearts i knew it wasnt the club i wanted to play for and now obviously this move has come back and im really happy
6803797 id rather be adding to the squad than subtracting as it were
6803798 shaun i think came down and first of all hes been away from glasgow for about 18 months there was definitely a bit of homesickness early on but i think he got over that
6803799 boyd was there in the squad david clarkson was there stephen fletcher and they are all good young strikers
6803800 boyds record at club record is very good there is a role there but james mcfadden and kenny miller are experienced players and james has an excellent goalscoring ratio and kenny does step up to the plate at internationals and his pace through the middle extends the team gives you depth and links the team
6803801 so he boyd is going to have to go some to get into the team
6803802 kris boyd cannot get fit i thought this summer kris boyd was going to be the new slimmed down kris boyd i mean his scoring record in modern terms is phenomenal its something like 75 in 110 games for rangers and for scotland i think it is something like eight in 14 but the guy cannot get fit
6803803 ive argued the case for kris boyd if youve scored 75 goals in 110 games for rangers then you would argue that your club manager should build your team around that potent weapon
6803804 but paul le guen looked at him and said he cant do it and walter smith has looked at him and to be blunt about it has said no hes not a priority for the team
6803805 now hes got this record why do these managers not use him and hes come back after the summer and he does not look 100 percent fit
6803806 samuel peter is an exceptionally dangerous puncher who has already beaten some worthy opponents
6803807 i know that it will be a very tough fight i will reach my dream of winning the world championship for the third time and being champion at the same time with my brother
6803808 for me there is no doubt at all i will defend my title
6803809 i saw the officer running from it i looked to the left and there was a guy standing in the yard and i looked at the officer he was down
6803810 i said im trying to get to you and they were still shooting at him
6803811 he was shot in the lower abdomen that s the first wound i saw then i saw the upper shot
6803812 i was leaning down trying to hold his head up
6803813 i knew if i could keep his head up and keep him talking he would make it the first thing that came to my mind was to keep him talking
6803814 i could have easily turned around and avoided it i could have went the other way i couldve but something made me stop
6803815 i couldnt leave a guy laying over there in the gutter that would really bother me
6803816 i dont think anyone in those houses saw the officer on the ground it was a dark area i dont think he would have made it
6803817 i wanted to make sure he was ok and i wanted to secure him so they wouldnt come over and kill him
6803818 he was someones child or father you know he just wasnt a police officer he could have been anyone i just wanted to help him because he needed help and he was doing his job
6803819 i think i was meant to be there i was right there when it happened and im glad i was there

6803821 ipswich is no exception and we just have to go there and try and play our game
6803822 were not getting carried away with the decent start weve had we just have to go there and be as professional as we can in trying to pick up the three points
6803823 weve got to play our own game whether thats at home or away
6803824 were a team that likes to impose ourselves on the opposition like we did against sheffield wednesday and we need to play at that sort of tempo
6803825 ive chased a few things up in terms of loans and been thwarted in one or two areas but well continue and do our best to get somebody in
6803826 if you go into the premier league in terms of salaries theres only so much you can pay and players have to want to come out of the premier league to play in the championship
6803827 its not as simple as picking the phone up and saying i want him and it happens
6803828 we would be looking for a loan with a view to buy and we have to ensure if it came to buying we have the right funding in place to do that
6803829 i have spoken to gabor a few times and i have said that if he can go and play somewhere then we would look to do that
6803830 he has obviously had a good career and at the age he is he will want to play games
6803831 his agent who i know quite well gave me a call
6803832 he said jimmy had done as much as he could training on his own and was there any chance of him taking part in a group situation
6803833 im learning english to be able to help my children in school
6803834 but also because if you dont know english here youre ignored you cant communicate with the hospitals or teachers in the schools and you cant drive its limiting
6803835 with this fast growing population we really need to do more than what were doing today
6803836 with this information we are now armed to go to the counties state and local organizations to make sure were doing the right thing
6803837 everybody comes here with the hope of a better life and those of us with better lives have a responsibility to make those dreams come true like others did for our families
6803838 were all children of immigrants and we need to remember where we came from
6803839 i think delaware needs to be the first state in the nation in how we deal with diversity and how we capitalize on our diversity
6803840 most dont earn enough to meet their familys basic needs and thats especially true for those who dont speak english
6803841 everyone benefits if immigrants learn english as theyre contributing more in taxes and are more successful so everyone needs to look at this as their responsibility
6803842 its not something you automatically pick up which is why its so critical to have these programs
6803843 if you cant speak english you cant communicate with others or find a good job if you cant speak english youre discriminated against
6803844 sussex has the fastest growing population theyre the youngest with the lowest incomes so the problems there are intensified
6803845 the population there is vastly different than in new castle
6803846 we need an assessment like this so we can know how our resources can be used in a more effective way
6803847 but i also hope that people realize there are a lot of good things latinos bring to this state
6803848 right now we have nine adult dogs five breeding and four in retirement and im down to six puppies from two recent litters that produced 17 puppies
6803849 we keep the older moms and dads the senior citizens who are no longer having puppies as part of our family
6803850 and i was always calling my mom and telling her what happened and shed say are you writing these down
6803851 mom and dad richard and jolan jackson still live in st charles
6803852 i never did write down the stories i told over the years so what is in the book are the ones that stood out in my mind and i remembered
6803853 ill always wonder how many good ones did i forget
6803854 i can still picture that so clear in my mind when he first realized what was up the pure love in this gesture by the wife and how she pulled it off
6803855 there was so much emotion i cried as much as they did
6803856 sure i worry over them wonder how theyve turned out so i welcome this
6803857 i wanted to make it a little educational because sometimes people have no idea about dogs
6803858 im really hoping justice is going to be done for these women

6803894 i think the memo is the primary issue at this point because it appears to be fraudulent and there is in the eyes of the faculty a violation of uca standards of integrity

6803904 but shes got her first olympic games under her belt and it looks good for london shes got such a big engine and so much raw power that if the number of track events increases i can certainly see her doing more than one
6803905 the advice ill be giving her is to have a word with vicky tonight and ask her how she felt she was going to pack it in but she came back and dominated i think shanaze can do the same shes a true warrior but you need experience too and today wasnt her day

6803908 we are pleased that cosla has approached us to reopen talks on this years pay award following the successful strike by members of the three unions on wednesday
6803909 obviously we want a solution to this dispute so we hope that discussions around a new offer more acceptable to our members can start quickly
6803910 members made it very clear on wednesday that they want a settlement that protects them from inflation and does not lock them in to multi year awards
6803911 the talks are welcome but are not in themselves a solution
6803912 we will be talking to our fellow unions to agree future action should it be required and will announce this later
6803913 i made it absolutely clear on wednesday that our door was open and has been since the start of the negotiations
6803914 we then wrote to them yesterday inviting them in for talks and i am pleased they have accepted our invitation
6803915 however the threat of further action is not helpful in the context of a joint attempt to reach a solution to the dispute a solution which is acceptable to both councils and our workforce

6803926 i know i cant solve zimbabwes problems but i think i can make a difference in a few or in many peoples lives through the hospital which is working hard to help people in their community so i made a plan i have started a project to collected donated medical supplies and general goods and raise money to ship it to zimbabwe
6803927 well that little project is suddenly on a whole new scale i have now been given medical goods valued at approximately 50 000 thats fifty thousand dollars in case like me you cant quite believe it these goods are all in perfect usable condition and consist of basic medical items like gauze dressings incontinence pads gloves gowns and drapes they will make an enormous difference for people needing medical care in zimbabwe

6803937 and my butcher block it was left outside in the rain and appears to have been out there all month it had never been cleaned after use and was covered in mold
6803938 the laundry situation was horrendous there were towels everywhere and as i mentioned already they were disgusting i threw out an entire garbage bag full of towels and there was still at least 10 loads of laundry to do after it was all sorted out and for some reason the on off knob to the dryer was pried off it could not even be fixed or replaced by the handyman
6803939 the back deck was terrible as well the bbq had been moved to the opposite side of the deck and the gas tank was not on the stand
6803940 shes lucky she didnt find her butcher block in the rd
6803941 candles were burned without any plates under them there was candle wax all over the table tiles and on the deck under the table a step down to the lower deck was broken and left hanging
6803942 there were also cigarette butts put out on the wood deck and many thrown over the deck onto the gravel path by the outdoor shower what ever happened to using ash trays or how about an empty beer bottle there were plenty of those left around ed note oh snap where did these people come from when i finally went to use the pool the skimmer net was torn

6803950 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6803951 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6803952 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6803953 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
6803954 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate

6803958 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6803959 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6803960 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
6803961 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6803962 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6803963 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6803964 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6803965 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6803966 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6803967 espero que en septiembre se est ejecutando el proyecto de los m dulos
6803968 h bitos de convivencia ciudadana similares a los de cualquier comunidad de vecinos
6803969 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6803970 i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalise with a photo already had a photo set against it
6803971 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6803972 you know i could throw a 10 000 bill out the window right now and make one person very happy
6803973 well i could throw ten 1 000 bills out the window and make 10 people very happy
6803974 of course then i could throw one hundred 100 bills out the window and make a hundred people very happy
6803975 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6803976 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6803977 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6803978 is likely to fall short of potential for a time
6803979 we found that students with high levels of involuntary subordination were more likely to experience recurring episodes of major depression even after controlling for lifetime history of major depression and current depressive status
6803980 this is further evidence that there are adaptive aspects which trigger recurrences of depression
6803981 its similar to the ordering of weakest to strongest that we see in the animal kingdom
6803982 it was crucial to show that involuntary subordination was itself causing depression and not vice versa
6803983 in future research well need to clarify the specific vulnerability to depression that entrapment and social comparison pose
6803984 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6803985 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6803986 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6803987 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6803988 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6803989 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6803990 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6803991 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6803992 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6803993 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6803994 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6803995 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6803996 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6803997 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6803998 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6803999 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6804000 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6804001 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6804002 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6804003 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6804004 the higher your pagerank the more relevant your site is
6804005 black or white as long as you did it right
6804006 everytime you build a link your sites reputation is subject to destruction
6804007 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6804008 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6804009 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6804010 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6804011 too many writers of procedural crime fiction forget to take a break its good to go off and write something else otherwise you can end up past your sell by date
6804012 people ask me where i get my twisted ideas from
6804013 and i always say that its the exact same place that everyone gets them from who hasnt been cut off in traffic and wanted to exact some horrible revenge
6804014 theyre both about entertaining audiences for a kick off you have to engage a crowd at a gig before they start heckling or throwing glasses about the place a writer has to hook in the reader in just as quickly
6804015 i needed to give tom thorne a rest if you ignore that little voice in your head that says do something else then youll start to hear it from critics readers and other writers having a pregnant female cop as a central character felt like a decent departure
6804016 this book is very dark but its also i hope quite funny in places
6804017 its much more of a domestic book i hung out with some gangs and got introduced to some young kids in street crews but most of the research in this book had to do with um pregnancy i tried asking my wife claire a television director but it was all so long ago
6804018 for all the dark horrendous stuff we write we are a really friendly lot we see each other at crime writing conferences and things were quite a close knit gang cause we do feel slightly marginalised by the literary establishment most of whom would kill to have our sales figures
6804019 which is why some write crime fiction under pseudonyms its like people who say oh i dont read crime fiction like theyve never gone into an airport bookshop and bought patricia cornwell or john grisham or me
6804020 i was already doing stand up comedy and writing material for that
6804021 my publisher put my name on the side of buses and gave me tv adverts in the middle of csi
6804022 this will be my third trip to australia australians are pretty good at that
6804023 i cant tell you the last time i wrote anything new
6804024 i do crime writing for the love of it too of course
6804025 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6804026 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6804027 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6804028 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6804029 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6804030 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6804031 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6804032 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6804033 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6804034 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6804035 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6804036 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6804037 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6804038 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6804039 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6804040 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6804041 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6804042 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6804043 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6804044 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6804045 mrs gotbaums death while tragic does not warrant criminal charges against police officers who were simply trying to carry out their duties they committed no crime
6804046 from what we know at this stage they may have been grossly negligent in how they treated her but they certainly were not acting criminally
6804047 yet consumers consistently choose coke in larger numbers an anomaly usually attributed to cokes marketing and packaging but another theory argued by malcolm gladwell in blink is that pepsis sweetness appeals more in a sip than over the course of a whole can
6804048 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6804049 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6804050 we want to share the message of hope and acceptance with students everywhere
6804051 we show individuals how to take a positive step toward recovery and educate families on how they can support their loved ones
6804052 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6804053 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6804054 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6804055 i think were able to compete at the level that this team needs us to compete at
6804056 im not going to say were randy moss or anything like that but were the guys that we are and the guys that were going with and we feel confident and everybody in this locker room feels confident with the guys that we put on the field each and every game
6804057 im kind of one of those guys that just goes into things with an open mind and whatever happens happens
6804058 i know what im capable of doing and all the hard work ive put in i just cant wait to get in there
6804059 i dont see it as we have to make up anything
6804060 last year was last year this is a brand new year nobody has any yards anywhere so if we just come out and do what we need to do i think the offense will continue to flourish as it did were not feeling any pressure we just want to go out and make plays and make the most of each opportunity
6804061 first game starting in the nfl im just hoping to get out there and hopefully make a great impression
6804062 from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds
6804063 a lot of that credit has to go with gene and what he stood for he stood his ground on a lot of key issues with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with the presidents at the time be it troy vincent or trace armstrong they worked to get us in a very good position and hes left us in a very good position
6804064 whether it was as a hall of fame offensive lineman with the oakland raiders or as executive director of the nfl players association gene was a tremendous leader and a wonderful person
6804065 gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans
6804066 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6804067 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

6804070 this album captures my creative mind state and shows more versatility of me as a solo artist that has matured with the god given gift of being poetic spiritual street and political all at the same time while keeping interesting concepts alive i feel like majority of albums have lost that vibe in todays music
6804071 i called it ultra sounds because thats what doctors use to see a baby before its fully developed before its born i sat in the incubator of hip hop waiting for my turn and now its time this will be the beginning of hell razah music as a label as well as a fully developed solo artist now i want my fans to see me not only as a good feature or as a group member but to see i can hold it down alone as well
6804072 this project will be the last time you see the hell side of razah
6804073 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours
6804074 ahhh im not sure i got to concentrate here on my work
6804075 he said all we have to do is find a really rich country like switzerland and marry it
6804076 all of boston is to be placed under house arrest for four days later this month luciannes rhyming readers have responded with their own verses a sample
6804077 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into

6804083 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6804084 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman

6804088 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6804089 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
6804090 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6804091 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6804092 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6804093 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6804094 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6804095 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6804096 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6804097 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6804098 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6804099 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6804100 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6804101 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6804102 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6804103 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6804104 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6804105 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6804106 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6804107 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6804108 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6804109 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6804110 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6804111 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6804112 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6804113 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6804114 everything in my lif is falling apart i need time to figure shit out
6804115 kenyans abroad for kenyas economy there is for example a new generation of internationally educated kenyan entrepreneurs who are working at bringing africa into the global mainstream
6804116 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6804117 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6804118 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6804119 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6804120 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6804121 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6804122 he bolt might have interpreted that his joy in another way but the way it was perceived was
6804123 he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6804124 wyst pi b d ati czy wys a do producenta
6804125 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6804126 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6804127 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6804128 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6804129 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6804130 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6804131 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6804132 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6804133 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6804134 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6804135 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6804136 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6804137 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6804138 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6804139 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6804140 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6804141 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6804142 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6804143 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6804144 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6804145 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6804146 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6804147 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6804148 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6804149 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6804150 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6804151 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6804152 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6804153 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6804154 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6804155 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6804156 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6804157 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6804158 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6804159 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6804160 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6804161 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6804162 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6804163 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6804164 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6804165 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6804166 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6804167 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6804168 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6804169 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6804170 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6804171 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6804172 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6804173 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6804174 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6804175 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6804176 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day
6804177 the general consensus is that we should have the best overall crop production in 30 years we received rain when it was needed
6804178 however we may see improvement in this index in the months ahead
6804179 over 44 percent of the bankers reported that consumers as a result of higher energy prices were encouraged to shop locally slightly less than 12 percent disagreed with this linkage
6804180 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6804181 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6804182 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6804183 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6804184 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6804185 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6804186 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6804187 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6804188 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton

6804190 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6804191 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6804192 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6804193 we would never have put our support behind it and our reputation on the line if we hadnt thought this was one of the great books of this century
6804194 its immensely brave of the childrens book council to award this book the prize because it makes a statement about picture books for young readers
6804195 we have a romanticised view of what a stockmans life is like a man from snowy river view and i wanted to present life in a stock camp as it really is in all its grittiness
6804196 if you dont want young children to be exposed dont give them this book
6804197 part of the problem is a lot of schools buy books sight unseen and thats idiotic
6804198 he has two expressions one with his hat on and one with his hat off
6804199 i dont look back too much i kind of look forward just to what i am doing now i sort of live in the present if i start getting to where i live in the past then it is time for me to sit around and play bacci ball with all the other old folks on the weekends
6804200 it is a full time job just trying to keep up with him
6804201 we thought we were just telling a good police drama about a cop who was sort of renegade
6804202 he had a hard time fathoming that the criminals were allowed certain freedoms that he thought he should have the public thought it was great but not the critics they said oh my god how could you do that but you do it because it is there why did sir edmund hillary go up the mountain maybe it is a sort of contrarian point of view where you figure because it was not so politically correct as people like to have nowadays it makes it more fun to do and i hate trends i think that we have gone too much the other way everybody is all soft now
6804203 boxing is just what is going on but it is a father daughter love story the relationship with the daughter he never had and the father she never had and they reach this great pinnacle of success and it turns tragic
6804204 this romantic stuff is really hard i cant wait to get back to shooting and killing
6804205 a man my age would not be working in the police he would be retired many times over
6804206 i joke i say what do you want me to do you want me to be a fly fisherman and retiree and then all of a sudden somebody does a crime and he gets on his walker
6804207 i consider myself too individualistic to be either left or right
6804208 what the ultra right have done to the republican party is just stupid
6804209 i was catching a ride on a douglas ad navy plane but we didnt quite make it to the end of the trip
6804210 the navy wanted me to stay around for a hearing while everyone else i knew was being shipped to the centre of korea and having a lot of problems the hearing never happened and i got lost in the bureaucracy of the military i ended up spending two years on the monterey peninsula and fell in love with it which is why i live near there now
6804211 i direct the way i would like to be directed as an actor i would rather be sympathetic to people but i try to be spontaneous and catch people at their very best or at their earliest you can over analyse a part and it just gets weighed down i get people when they are just doing it like their brain is in real life if you do 25 takes of every shot pretty soon all you are showing is that the actor has a technique to repeat it over and over again but there is a certain deadness in their eyes and you lose the spirit of the piece to me casting a picture puts you 90 per cent there if you cast a picture well then it is just a question of organising things setting up the composure of the film and the rhythm of it the scenes
6804212 i like casting things in a different kind of order in changeling i cast john malkovich as the reverend because he is probably the least guy like a reverend and i just thought he would bring a different shading to it in mystic river i cast the vulnerable kid not as a small delicate person but a big guy like tim robbins and the small parts are what makes the big parts take care of themselves it is the old thing about managing money if you watch the small coins the big ones take care of themselves i feel that if every small part is good those little cameos just reflect on the overall picture
6804213 he is an adaptable guy he will adapt to the story he is telling sometimes clint likes a little roughness in his movies it makes it more real he doesnt like it to be too polished
6804214 most people close down as they age but clint has opened up in lots of ways intellectually emotionally as a filmmaker in his choice of materials he has become more and more expansive

6804222 i like to ride in them once a day if i can it brings one so in touch with life
6804223 life is going to be true to the end of the play
6804224 only people who disturb peoples mental security could support such a thing
6804225 one of the misunderstandings is that you try and compare the institutions of countries which are not similar to each other
6804226 most of the people i knoware in favour of reform not revolution because people are too tired to experience another revolution
6804227 certain western media best represented by cnn and bbc in the name of press freedom have been unscrupulously slandering and defaming developing nations
6804228 we use the internet mostly for entertainment sharing information earning money or other fun
6804229 bloggers have succeeded in doing something that years of standing on the street corner and shouting no to torture or no to the interior ministry has never managed to accomplish
6804230 fifty years ago saudi bedouins were riding around on camels now theyre using mobile phones and the best technology
6804231 it will take time for society to catch up with this technology
6804232 communications tools such as youtube twitter facebook and blogging dont get socially interesting until they get technologically boring
6804233 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6804234 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6804235 i think there might be some impropriety about what went on here
6804236 looking into an ordinance for the santa clarita valley that would be instituted in times of drought
6804237 there was not a single option that all attendees could agree on
6804238 got into an argument with his wife and adult daughter
6804239 links regional planning for housing and transportation with californias new greenhouse gas reduction goal
6804240 be granted relief from much of the environmental red tape
6804241 be required to expedite zoning and allow the builders to actually build
6804242 its a direct 180 change from where he was when he got elected and thats really frustrating i think for many californians and for those of us in the legislature who supported him
6804243 we dont need a law for everything a driver does the next one is going to be you cant drive while you are eating a hamburger
6804244 fighting relentlessly on behalf of the american people for real energy reform
6804245 let down the students and the taxpayers with their apparent mismanagement of the 2001 bond that raised 158 million
6804246 i am inclined to say not a penny more until the hart school board comes clean
6804247 provide real relief to the supervisors constituents who are at present stuck on the 405
6804248 in the parking lot of a convenience store to waste away their lives
6804249 the suburbs used to be a place to go now they are a place to get away from
6804250 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6804251 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6804252 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6804253 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6804254 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6804255 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6804256 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6804257 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6804258 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6804259 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6804260 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6804261 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6804262 its going to help me out throughout my senior year
6804263 that made me realise what his intentions were in relation to my future with the company
6804264 very strange fiona is a very good singer with a wonderful voice
6804265 i am passionate about it i really care about its future and not just from a singers point of view
6804266 i think i have been overlooked but i can give dozens of singers names who have been overlooked
6804267 is not just for personal reasons its for the benefit of the entire operatic community that they hear australias finest voices and i truly believe they are not hearing them
6804268 id had meetings with fiona to discuss her possible roles with opera australia and at those meetings it was clear she would like to perform regularly with the company
6804269 but the letter that was sent to the board in april was a real bolt from the blue
6804270 to see a colleague and the company youre responsible for have such allegations levelled against them was very dispiriting
6804271 ive had a remarkable response not only from colleagues but from the public people ive never met in my life
6804272 i think it validates something i have felt for a long time and also that i have heard for a long time im not the only one who feels this way
6804273 i read what fiona said and i think shes picked up on what a lot of us feel
6804274 i felt the board gave us incredible respect they listened to everything i had to say they took note of it all and they promised they would get back to me
6804275 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6804276 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6804277 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6804278 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6804279 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6804280 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6804281 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6804282 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension

6804284 bill said this his father was a great friend of my father ill be very frank vietnam divided families divided people it was a terrible time of our country people didnt know one another since then ayers has been in the forefront of a lot of education issues and helping us in public schools and things like that people keep trying to align ayers with barack obama its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community

6804286 there isnt anything that is comprehensive and builds one semester upon another one course upon another
6804287 what this potentially could do is create such a program
6804288 in public education we need to change the way were looking at the world
6804289 we have a trend that is moving in the right direction
6804290 i think well soon become one of the best districts in the county

6804299 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6804300 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging

6804314 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6804315 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6804316 dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee
6804317 instead of invoking paris britney and obscure sixties radicals sen
6804318 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old

6804320 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6804321 politicians are forever trying to cast their candidacies as closely rooted in the communities from which they sprung a purposeful attempt to ensure that voters know that the candidate understands the problems of people like you put simply the worst thing you can call a politician is an elitist
6804322 clinton raised less than 2 5 million last month and at months end still owed nearly 24 million according to the report filed wednesday with the federal election commission she cut her debt by only about 1 2 million
6804323 despite barack obama encouraging his supporters to help her retire her campaign debt theres little sign thats happening
6804324 supporters of sen hillary clinton are more interested in hearing her speak next week at the democratic national convention than hearing sen barack obamas planned acceptance of the nomination for president according to a new study
6804325 56 percent of clinton supporters are very interested in her speech to the delegates while 43 percent show similar interest in obamas speech only 37 percent of obama supporters report high interest in clintons address while 60 percent say they are very interested in hearing the illinois senators speech

6804335 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6804336 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
6804337 has been conditioned on our expectation that the prices of oil and other commodities would ultimately stabilize in part as the result of slowing global growth
6804338 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6804339 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
6804340 a statutory resolution regime for nonbanks besides reducing uncertainty would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails
6804341 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach

6804353 i dont have any problem with women priests or married priests
6804354 lots of other christian religions have that and they seem to be doing that
6804355 when we find that joy we celebrate through prayer and daily contact with people
6804356 we learn this is a wonderful life that way its not easy but i believe if god brings you to it hell bring you through it we have to trust god is there

6804375 she retrieved a heavy glass bottle filled with her pale pink kate perfume which she sprayed on my wrist
6804376 despite or perhaps because of an ensuing cocaine scandal kate has emerged as a more influential fashion icon than ever the paradox being that while moss on the one hand excited condemnation those who disapprove of her still cant help being interested in her or deny her talent with clothes

6804387 we think the flow of news is going to continue to be negative for sterling
6804388 the market will have to price in the risk of a rate cut sooner rather than later and more rate cuts than it has priced in right now our central view is the first cut will occur in november
6804389 we had expected for some time that the boe would cut the bank rate to 4 0 percent by q3 2009 we now add a further cumulative 50 basis points of easing to take rates down to 3 50 percent by end 2009

6804441 mayer informed plaintiff that spielberg could not do the project and suggested that plaintiff consider producer brian grazer
6804442 he recognized the potential for the appearance of impropriety if it came to light that he had selected a client of his girlfriends firm as the first guest editor especially if she would end up profiting personally accordingly plaintiff requested that mullens recuse herself from any involvement in promotion of grazers guest editorship and mullens expressly agreed
6804443 rosenberg determined that the project needed more promotion than the los angeles times was giving it and asked 42west to get involved
6804444 because of her work both ap and reuters had written positive pieces about grazers guest editorship

6804455 last season we were never able to raise our heads whenever we went behind but that is not the case anymore
6804456 now we dont collapse when we concede a goal and we know how to fight back
6804457 our defense had a complicated game against madrid but we knew how to maintain our line and if we continue to work on it we will start to see good results
6804458 the return leg will be difficult but if we play like we did in the first leg and approach the game with a winners mentality then we will not have any problems winning the supercopa
6804459 we must approach the match with the idea that we have a real chance to win the supercopa
6804460 we have to go there and be ambitious and build on our first leg result rather than just depend on it
6804461 they will definitely play better at home than they did at the mestalla they are now a side that focuses on the aspect of team work but they still have a lot of quality individual players who can turn the game around
6804462 it is important to take things slowly one step at a time it is necessary to remember that we are practically starting from scratch right now we have to focus on the possibility of winning an important title and begin the new league campaign with confidence

6804492 t he case raises the broader policy and constitutional considerations that argue against using civil liability to control the behavior of pregnant women
6804493 expanded access to prenatal education and heath care facilities will far more likely serve the very real state interest in preventing increasing numbers of children from being born in to sic lives of pain and despair
6804494 as the president of the law review obama didnt write articles he edited and reviewed them
6804495 they probably dont want to have you reporters going back
6804496 like most second year law students on the harvard law review senator obama wrote an unsigned student case comment that summarized a recent decision by a state or lower federal court the piece analyzed a case in which a mother was sued by her child for injuries caused by the mothers negligent driving during her pregnancy senator obama concluded that in such cases the illinois supreme court was correct not to allow lawsuits by children against their mothers
6804497 he wrote that the best way to protect the health of fetuses was to provide prenatal education and health care to pregnant women issues he remains committed to today and which he has worked to advance as a legislator and in this campaign
6804498 student obama was acutely attuned to the limits of the judiciary and of suits between children and their mother in this sensitive area
6804499 this is a modest and balanced piece that fits easily within the framework of the law at the time
6804500 involving maternal activities that might be considered intentional or reckless infliction of prenatal injuries on the fetus
6804501 imposing civil liability on mothers may be as likely to deter the carrying of pregnancies to term as to deter maternal negligence during pregnancy
6804502 fetal maternal tort suits might entail far more intrusive scrutiny of a womans behavior than the scrutiny involved in the discrete regulation of the abortion decision
6804503 on the other hand the state may also have a more compelling interest in ensuring that fetuses carried to term do not suffer from debilitating injuries than it does in ensuring that any particular fetus is born

6804536 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
6804537 putins role in the blatantly misleading information issued by the government about the chechnya offensive also has been criticized his talent for creating legends has been evident in his explanations about the war for example putin told the writers group that the military had been open with the news media when the military has in fact hidden information about casualties combat events attacks on civilians and its goals and methods

6804853 currently with 35 million families 70 of russias population working 8 million hectares of land and producing more than 40 of russias agricultural output this is in all likelihood the most extensive microscale food production practice in any industrially developed nation

6804857 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
6804858 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
6804859 the igp took much of the time to explain and deny the accusations than listening to our concerns on saturdays elections
6804860 i was really excited to go out there and give usain his third world record

6804866 both in her writing and in her nuanced performance skinner wrenches humor from awkward circumstances and cringe inducing comments you will love her
6804867 she absolutely owns these characters each one is deeply flawed but her performance is polished like a diamond and the scenes are gut bustingly hilarious filled with truly memorable moments
6804868 shameless is not to be missed its hilarious and heartbreaking and youll know that soon you can turn to your friends at a party and say

6804874 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6804875 i suppose if youve got seven maybe eight houses the economy looks fundamentally sound to you
6804876 but if youre having trouble making the mortgage payment then the economy looks awful different
6804877 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6804878 one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion purchasing part of the property he couldnt afford
6804879 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6804880 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
6804881 has been conditioned on our expectation that the prices of oil and other commodities would ultimately stabilize in part as the result of slowing global growth
6804882 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6804883 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
6804884 a statutory resolution regime for nonbanks besides reducing uncertainty would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails
6804885 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
6804886 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
6804887 there are little guys out there who are 5 8 165 or 170 pounds those guys generally dont last too long they might light it up for a while but they cant take the physical beating and then there are these guys who are 5 6 5 7 and weigh 200 pounds they are not little guys they are just short guys its a big difference justin just like jones drew is a short guy
6804888 this is further proof that the wnba is still a long way from being a big time league if this kind of injury happened to kobe bryant or lebron james there would be outrage in l
6804889 since weve started using the spread the ducks have lost a qb to injury nine times at least by my count kc vs sc kc vs ua dd vs ua dd vs asu dd vs ua bl vs ua bl vs ucla ck vs ucla ck vs osu thats nine times in 26 games under the spread the ducks have lost a qb in 35 of their games
6804890 its important that the house conduct its own review to ensure there is a clear understanding of the facts and sensitive and highly classified security information is not potentially compromised in the future
6804891 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6804892 from the great illusions to western civ has got to go
6804893 i would remind senator hillary clinton and other democrats critical of the bush administrations policies that the framework agreement her husbands administration negotiated was a failure
6804894 despite the critical need for fuel in our region the unangan aleut people are americans first and we cannot support the political agenda attached to this donation
6804895 when you look at the desperation in our region especially with the fishing seasons poor and high unemployment i take my hat off
6804896 i have had a professional relationship with him and hes always been a good board member
6804897 we never got the article but she had evidence about these abducted people and there were photographs

6804901 particular importance of the case and wide resonance within society
6804902 and if you cannot take it any more if you are unwilling to risk you have to leave
6804903 its not my kind of humor and it would not have happened if i had been there it must not be repeated
6804904 this is more of the same desperate and petty tactics we have come to expect from the republican party leadership that is absent of any real plan to move ohio forward nothing will come of this
6804905 i am tired of seeing political commercials of ted strickland claiming he lives in lisbon when he actually resides in columbus this is exactly why i filed this challenge against him he doesnt pay taxes here so he shouldnt vote here
6804906 we will for the first time print the full size daily paper in milan and paris during the upcoming collections to make sure you dont miss a beat during this critical season
6804907 it was the only way to get both guys in the lineup

6804912 every time i look around another politician is doing something
6804913 look at george ryan they finally caught up with him
6804914 i dont think this thing is going to stick at all
6804915 to be honest i do not see why all financial disclosure forms of u n officials are not made public it is part of the responsibility we undertake in the u s government as senior officials so anyone can see what our pitiful net worth is
6804916 it is the law in venezuela that all government officials must declare their wealth in the public record before they take office
6804917 drogba is better he has been working every day with the fitness coach i think next sunday it would be difficult for him but maybe against tottenham august 31 he could play 30 to 45 minutes

6804919 a pirate network is believed to stretch from europe to dubai identifying targets and feeding intelligence to the gangs based along somalias long coastline
6804920 somalia has no central government we are worried that more may join the pirates to hijack ships because its very lucrative and there is no deterrent
6804921 the united nations is the only agency that can stop this menace
6804922 the international community has to agree to find ways to solve this worsening problem that is the only way forward
6804923 a idol in my eyes god of the game heart of the city roc a fella chain never be the same never be another number one young hov also my big brother

6804925 i am tired of seeing political commercials of ted strickland claiming he lives in lisbon when he actually resides in columbus
6804926 is the american public to believe that neither of you nor your staffs nor anyone associated with your staffs had prior knowledge or involvement with the release of foleys e mails and or explicit instant messages is the american public to believe that abc news stumbled haphazardly on this story without democratic assistance
6804927 to assure the american people that neither you nor your staffs had prior knowledge or involvement at the strategic or tactical levels with the release of foleys e mails and or instant messages
6804928 republicans just dont get it every mother in america is asking how republicans could choose partisan politics over protecting kids and the republicans are asking who could have blown their cover up
6804929 if we had seen mark foleys horrific e mails or instant messages we would have immediately acted to protect these kids
6804930 of course we did not have the e mails or instant messages give me a break if you recall they also blamed us for indicting former majority leader tom delay r texas speaker hastert and his staff have known about foleys inappropriate behavior for years and their attempt to deflect their responsibility is absurd
6804931 i hate to give up sources but to the extent that i know the political parties of any of the people who helped us it would be the same party
6804932 they were passed to a colleague of mine from a source not someone from a democratic campaign a source on the hill
6804933 north korea must clearly recognize that a nuclear test would not help the north itself in any way
6804934 north korea should be held responsible for any consequences that could be caused by a test
6804935 a grave threat to the peace and security of northeast asia and the world
6804936 if north korea conducts a nuclear weapons test despite the concerns expressed by international society the security council must adopt a resolution outlining severely punitive measures
6804937 based on the development so far it would be best to view that a test is possible this weekend
6804938 north korea has already made a decision to carry out a test
6804939 if the u s removes sanctions then tensions can be eased otherwise launching a nuclear test is unavoidable for north korea
6804940 in spite of economic constraints in some markets like the united states on a worldwide basis servers continued to grow
6804941 the most significant driver in the quarter continued to be an upswing in x86 server replacements that started in the first quarter this coupled with web data centre build outs and growth in emerging markets produced solid q2 results
6804942 i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
6804943 sweetheart appreciate it for all its worth because it all changes when you get into your 30s
6804944 part of the reason for this incomplete analysis is the difficult econometric and data problems involved
6804945 bain stressed advertisings role in creating strong buyer seller attachments or brand loyalty through its ability to differentiate products his basic behavioral postulate was that buyers generally prefer established brands to new brands
6804946 economies of scale in advertising arise if successive advertising messages are either less costly to send pecuniary economies or more effective for the same cost technological economies firms with larger advertising expenditures would then have lower costs per unit of advertising concentration might increase over what it would be in the absence of advertising if market demand were not large enough to accommodate the same number of firms each producing at a higher optimal level of output
6804947 higher capital requirements might benefit existing firms by reducing the number of potential entrants but they would not necessarily change the existing size distribution of firms and thus concentration
6804948 stigler and becker show that when the level of advertising is held constant the firm perceives the elasticity of the demand curve to be the same for product x and commodity z it thus becomes obvious that advertising is more efficient when the firms demand curve is more elastic
6804949 it will also make computers better by taking out some of the inefficiencies of computers it will make them quieter and more reliable
6804950 pcs are fairly complex large machines that are massively underused by the majority

6804954 a great way to make god laugh is to make plans
6804955 it is insane to try and fix a problem with the same mindset that created the problem
6804956 hey dude can you please let me see the truth is this problem and grant me the wisdom to move toward the solution
6804957 from the act of procreation in which the blood of man and woman join so that the blood of both flows in the childs veins john advances to the impulse of nature which lies back of this sexual union
6804958 yet the decisive will in the act of procreation is that of the man not that of the woman hence john adds
6804959 1 paul takes it for granted that the christian home contains children nowhere has he cause to treat the modern crimes of abortion and so called birth control which defeat the divine purpose of marriage as instituted by god gen 1 27 28 and its chief blessing ps 127 3 5 children keep obeying your parents in the lord for this is righteous
6804960 here is sanity whatever is in league today against the christian church anti christian scientific speculation higher criticism the new theology new thought mormonism eddyism materialism sensualism secretism birth control all the forces of sin and carnality which seek to corrupt the church and to slay her inner life are the gog and magog of ezekiel and john but the great day of the lord is even now approaching which will witness their irrevocable doom graebner
6804961 words of my friend connie a blogger whom i love and respect but simply disagree with this time around
6804962 will put a damper on instrument x bonds or eliminate them all together
6804963 my guess is that the audience of people issuing instrument x bonds will shrink if the fasb proposal is approved in its current form

6804975 the democratic party does have a challenge now to show that it wants to make sure the african american leadership is included in decision making
6804976 theres a hue and cry out there of disillusionment based on what happened in the primary
6804977 i feel strongly that we in the democratic party should have had an african american running for one of the statewide positions
6804978 the republican party made the decision at the national level that they wanted michael steele to run for the u s senate
6804979 there is a concern among democrats that steele is gaining momentum

6804984 it was pretty funny because we didnt realize what was gonna come but you almost have to just laugh at it all
6804985 it dawned on me toward the end of the season that the guys never said anything of the travel situation
6804986 the players the other coaches none of them ever said anything about it the guys never blamed a bad performance or a disappointing loss on the fact that we were always traveling
6804987 it feels good obviously any time you can get back to championship weekend
6804988 winning the championship in this league is quite hard but repeating is essentially impossible and trying to do what were trying to do is something most people wouldnt even think is worth talking about
6804989 hes able to cut through to the heart of the matter
6804990 one person cant make a difference theres so much out there that throwing my body into the ring wont make a bit of difference
6804991 creating an atmosphere for boys that will allow them to fantasize over things that women and children are raped and murdered for is wrong dead wrong
6804992 no team can progress from the bottom half of the league when more hard hat players get the ice time at the expense of young raw talents in need of nurturing
6804993 every previous non voter who votes democrat this cycle nets obama one vote but every typical democrat who backs mccain nets the republican two votes
6804994 by the time they foreclosed on the house today shed be dead
6804995 sin duda la causa principal del alza de precios de las materias primas y de la crisis crediticia han sido los bajos tipos de inter s a escala global
6804996 pese a las discrepancias pocos dudan que la econom a mundial atraviesa un momento dif cil entre la espada de la recesi n y la pared del recalentamiento y se requerir una notable coordinaci n de pol ticas globales y una enorme dosis de suerte para evitar cualquiera de ambos riesgos

6805000 wasnt the first communication campaign launched by the foundation but it has been the most fruitful as already more than 840 000 french people joined it and pledged to decrease their carbon dioxide emissions
6805001 total actions by members would account for reduction of 420 000 tonnes of greenhouse gases emissions during last years presidential elections he asked the twelve candidates to sign a pact stating that once they would be elected they would act on environmental issues and climate change mitigation it was a major success as the elected president mr sarkozy included elements of this pact into his own plans indeed the grenelle de lenvironnement

6805253 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
6805254 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ
6805255 wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection
6805256 forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us
6805257 ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
6805258 before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god
6805259 nay but o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor
6805260 ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
6805261 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made through him and without him was not any thing made that was made
6805262 no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him
6805263 so also christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son today have i begotten thee
6805264 but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god
6805265 therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute
6805266 the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men
6805267 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
6805268 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth

6805408 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker

6805443 in this day and age where jobs are hard to come by and production such as the work being done at eagle industries could just as easily be farmed out to companies abroad we take time to thank eagle industries for taking a dark time in our citys history as it relates to the events that surrounded this facility and have in turn provided our people with something positive something very much needed employment
6805444 we are honored to receive this recognition of our hard work in new bedford we take great pride in our employees our company and our important work for our men and women in uniform

6805446 our preliminary financial results for the fiscal year ending may 31 2008 reflect the difficult market conditions that exist in the homebuilding industry today which have continued to deteriorate throughout fiscal 2008 and into fiscal 2009
6805447 we are optimistic of reaching agreement with the lenders under our senior credit facility and finding an acceptable solution for the subordinated notes however terms for such agreement and solution acceptable to the company may not be available and therefore there are no guarantees we will successfully achieve compliance with the senior credit facility or be able to address our future requirements under the subordinated notes notwithstanding the current difficult market conditions the company continues to meet its operational objectives
6805448 extendicare facilities sound warm and fuzzy on paper the type of place that you would want your parents or grandparents to be if they needed care you couldnt provide them yourself
6805449 the reality is that these facilities have a long record of excessive and repeated citations by the washington department of social and health services for providing substandard care and care that violates the rights of residents
6805450 basically we believe that extendicares corporate strategy and policy is to maximize profits at the expense of the elderly and vulnerable people it claims to serve
6805451 we all know that there is a direct correlation between elder abuse and staffing levels in my opinion the extendicare facilities in washington are elder abuse cases waiting to happen its just a matter of whose parents or grandparents are going to be the victims
6805452 our second annual inc 5000 continues the most ambitious project in business journalism
6805453 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth

6805457 the olympic committees decision to create the new sponsorship category of official language training and testing supplier in 2007 and invite aifly to fill this role was one of the most important decisions in ensuring the success of the beijing olympics the training and testing services that aifly provided to olympic volunteers over the years leading up to the games were invaluable to our preparations
6805458 once we were asked to take on this role we determined that considering the limited time scale and complexity of the training program that was needed it would be most effective to focus on training volunteers in language and skills that they would be most likely to encounter and need to use effectively during the olympic and paralympic games
6805459 we use different training methods and focus on different content depending on the role and location that each volunteer will be assigned during the olympics so for example for medical aid volunteers we emphasized role playing and maintained small groups of between 4 and 10 students during training
6805460 last may i participated in the language training for college volunteers
6805461 ive been to six olympic games the beijing olympics is much better than i expected all the volunteers are very kind theyve given me a lot of help most of them can speak english fluently i did not expect their language skills to be so strong or to provide such professional service

6805465 de industrie heeft de afgelopen jaren veel sneller vooruitgang geboekt dan we 40 jaar geleden hadden kunnen denken
6805466 ahora el siguiente paso es crear un nuevo modelo de negocios y buscar inversionistas gracias en gran parte a la red que posee la incubadora
6805467 llega un momento en que como pyme agotas tu clientela la que est dada b sicamente por los contactos personales es entonces cuando llega la hora de buscar un apoyo para lograr contactos a otro nivel
6805468 como pyme hay que buscar qui n nos puede ayudar depende mucho de las ganas del que quiere incubar y de que exista un real apoyo en lo que necesitas
6805469 con la incubadora hemos estado trabajando para buscar nuevas herramientas que nos apoyen en cuanto a inversi n gesti n y an lisis del modelo de negocios a utilizar yo estoy trabajando en las oficinas de la incubadora y eso ya es un gran ahorro de costos de todo tipo creo que la incubaci n en chile es mucho m s dif cil para empresas que est n partiendo de cero que para las que ya tienen un tiempo y experiencia ganados
6805470 una de las cosas que m s le cuesta a un emprendedor es que en ciertos rubros se tiene que trabajar realizando pruebas donde el error es algo recurrente pero si uno cree firmemente en lo que est haciendo estar todo bien en cuanto a las incubadoras uno de sus grandes problemas es que en la mayor a de los casos no tienen dinero inmediato para los proyectos a menos que el interesado compruebe su experiencia
6805471 creo que el valor m s grande de ser incubados fue poder abrir puertas que si hubi ramos golpeado por nuestra cuenta jam s se habr an abierto ahora podemos postular a inversionistas empresas de capitales de riesgo o entidades gubernamentales los empresarios emergentes chilenos pueden ser muy buenos pero creo que les faltan conocimientos en reas como marketing o gesti n y es ah donde entra la incubadora

6805595 history is replete with armed forces having to get bloodied a little bit before they get better
6805596 were not leaving tomorrow but its the beginning of the end
6805597 you have new units fresh from basic training that sometimes desert and then you have older units that have had years of american advising and fight quite well
6805598 theres no doubt theyre a lot better than they used to be but theres still tremendous variation from unit to unit
6805599 i was a military man and i served the nation
6805600 the change since march is that its the iraqi security forces in the lead
6805601 the difference now is that its us supporting them and not the other way around they are not going to let basra slip back
6805602 proyectos como el de los mejores colegios por concesi n instituciones educativas administraban colegios distritales se acabaron simplemente para complacer a los l deres sindicales que no les gustaba este esquema
6805603 el gobierno distrital se est desperdiciando en temas como el metro que hace lo mismo que el transmilenio pero cuesta m s cuando hay graves situaciones como la de seguridad y espacio p blico
6805604 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6805605 it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now but people have got to understand that this will happen
6805606 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6805607 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6805608 we have to manage the business almost on an hour by hour basis
6805609 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6805610 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6805611 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6805612 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6805613 along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own
6805614 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
6805615 definitely off from what the production hoped its hard to know what exactly is to blame
6805616 you cant say its the economy because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter
6805617 i represented young people in foster care and became painfully aware of the lack of supportive services for young people involved in various systems like foster care and juvenile justice
6805618 because they have had these unstable childhoods they havent had the privilege and good fortune of having someone talk to them about how to develop marketable skills and make sure that theyre staying in school
6805619 since i have been with them i have changed a lot my grades in school went up
6805620 this is not rocket science these kids just need somewhere to go in order to keep them out of the court system in order to keep them off the street
6805621 in order to engage them in something positive so they can move on and lead a happy and healthy life
6805622 my hope is that young people can come here take risks learn new skills have a great time meet new friends and find caring compassionate adults who will be there for them
6805623 her head could get chopped off and she wouldnt even care

6805676 i guess michael could no longer use the line that how dpp will always face corruption charges and go to jail while kmts like to run away oversea in the future anymore
6805677 anon you are not even worth responding to i myself wont be doing it in the future as you seem to lack the ability to 1 present information clearly or 2 speak rationally
6805678 dpp clowns cant even acknowledge that kmt did save taiwan from the communist so that they could enjoy the fruits of

6805680 seventh fleet is hereby assigned to operational control cincfe for employment in following task hereby assigned cincfe by naval and air action prevent any attack on formosa or any air or sea offensive from formosa against mainland of china
6805681 lets have some decency and admit that without kmt taiwan would already been taken by china in 1950 and dpp clowns like chen will still be

6805691 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so

6805704 the government is determined to keep our fisheries strong as such various policy amendments and subsidies will be used to help fishermen
6805705 het is een geweldig gevoel om hier op het veld te staan
6805706 ik ben echt heel gelukkig dit is een schitterend stadion en het veld ligt er uitstekend bij
6805707 hier zou iets groots moeten gebeuren en ik hoop dat ik er deel van kan uitmaken ik heb zin om mij te geven voor deze club
6805708 ik sprak al met coach mark hughes uiteraard voor ik tekende was belangrijk te weten dat hij me echt wilde
6805709 hij lijkt me echt een dynamisch persoon er is ambitie hughes wil mij gebruiken als verdedigende middenvelder ik hou van die positie en dus ben ik gelukkig
6805710 maar ook verdedigend kan ik uit de voeten als de nood hoog is kan ik er ook spelen
6805711 ik kon in 2006 al naar engeland komen maar het lot heeft beslist dat ik er nu pas zal spelen ik ben blij met city ik denk dat het de juiste ploeg is op het juiste moment in mijn carri re
6805712 als er te veel en te lang over een transfer wordt gesproken komt er meestal niks van in huis
6805713 na mijn eerste gesprek met city was ik onder de indruk van de ambitie van deze club nadien was het makkelijk om een akkoord te bereiken
6805714 de engelse mentaliteit staat mij aan ook de engelse levensstijl en de manier van spelen hier staat mij aan ik denk niet dat ik veel moeite zal hebben om mij aan te passen
6805715 over de premier league weet ik veel over manchester city als ploeg niet zo heel veel
6805716 maar ik weet dat hier enorm veel ambitie is in de volgende maanden en jaren zullen we alleen sterker worden
6805717 maar de afgelopen jaren kon ik alleen maar aan de premier league denken
6805718 wat mijn sterke punten zijn ik win veel duels en ik ben goed in balrecuperatie maar ik zal nooit roepen dit kan ik heel goed uiteindelijk zal ik alles opnieuw moeten bewijzen
6805719 maar ik ben ervan overtuigd dat ik zal slagen anders zou ik nooit getekend hebben

6805728 and best of all whenever he slips up the media is there to make an exception for him
6805729 this automatically gives a certain credibility to all the other lingering accusations of shadiness against chen
6805730 the same ancestry links our hearts mountains and oceans can never keep us apart
6805731 opposition from you is like a vote of confidence from anyone else
6805732 i posted ages ago on the corruption in the chen administration no one seriously thought he was clean

6805737 europeans and americans me included sometime think way too high of ourselves considering we are only dominating the recent 2 centuries out of the total how many centuries of human civilization as far as my concern my thinking is way too difficult for average people to understand
6805738 im sorry you cant stomach it but theres no getting around the simple fact that shih left the dpp and joined an anti dpp group along with two other equally self centered turncoats hsu hsin liang and sisy chen the purpose of the red ant protests conducted almost entirely by blues was to attack the dpp and smear it as more corrupt than the kmt chen was merely the lever by which that was accomplished i cant understand why you have no trouble understanding chen to be corrupt but balk at including shih in that shih sold out to the other side period that sort of betrayal is quite common nowadays
6805739 one of the saddest aspects of modern taiwan is the poor grip the taiwanese have on their own history
6805740 as for the rest of your claims they are standard misreadings of history
6805741 the kmt did not save taiwan from communism quite the opposite by illegally claiming taiwan had been annexed to china the kmt foreclosed any other possibilities for taiwan including independence or a colonial status like that of namibia in fact it is because of the kmts illegal claim communism in the form of beijing appears likely to end up annexing taiwan in other words the kmt has delivered not saved taiwan into communist hands
6805742 no arguments involving facts of course you actually dont know who or what i used to work for
6805743 concrete accusations require evidence but attempting to pursue moral judgment with name calling cannot even qualify as a valid allegation
6805744 you could be right however i would like you to look up on how many case did switzerland lost in prosecuting money laundry it is the same thing here in the states fed almost never lost a rico case
6805745 taiwans misfortune may be that the kmt sells it down the river

6805791 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
6805792 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
6805793 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
6805794 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future
6805795 the activities of the free clinic and the involvement of the students of the college of osteopathic medicine provide a real life example of the putting patients first philosophy of education embraced by the college in its curriculum and service
6805796 students from the une college of osteopathic medicine who volunteer at the biddeford free clinic are surely among the best and the brightest

6805801 these savings are an essential part of getting new yorks fiscal house in order
6805802 with the state facing growing fiscal challenges i have directed each commissioner to sharply focus their operations on their agencys core mission especially in the current economic environment we have a responsibility to the taxpayers to carefully scrutinize every dollar we spend
6805803 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6805804 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6805805 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6805806 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6805807 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6805851 it s always interesting to see whether books get tucked under the heading of entertainment or life at blogs com the answer is neither while the web is positively awash in book related blogs there s no place to find them at this hot new hub there isn t even a single top 10 list on the subject
6805852 we will definitely feature book blogs and book related top ten lists as soon as possible back when we launched typepad five years ago the built in category list had tv movies and music all in one category and books all by themselves as a company all about helping people share words and with a flagship product that s actually called movable type we d be crazy not to love books

6805859 we konden kim geen mooier afscheidscadeau bezorgen dan een olympische medaille dat is het hoogste wat een atlete kan bereiken iedereen droomt ervan maar wij zitten nu bij het selecte groepje dat er ook eentje heeft onbeschrijflijk
6805860 we hebben ontspannen toegeleefd naar deze finale wat op bed gelegen en op internet gesurft de wedstrijd zelf verliep perfect de wissels waren goed en ik zag uit een uithoek dat jamaica uitviel die jamaicaanse greep maar en greep maar naar die stok en toen niks meer
6805861 toen ik de stok doorgaf aan kim begon het genieten al het was natuurlijk nog even stressen tot ze aan de meet was maar toen ik op het scorebord keek was de ontlading heel groot de ereronde die daarna volgde was ronduit hysterisch ik wist echt niet dat hier zoveel belgen zaten super
6805862 vooraf hadden we zeker gedacht dat een medaille tot de mogelijkheden behoorde en dat gevoel is na de wedstrijd zeker niet verdwenen
6805863 we hebben hier als ploeg een sterke prestatie neergezet we waren de beste ploeg en we hebben de beste kansen gehad helaas voor ons viel de verdiende gelijkmaker niet en moesten we zelfs met een 2 0 achterstand gaan rusten wat de ploeg na de rust heeft laten zien was mooi mijn jongens hebben het hoofd niet laten hangen maar hebben er alles aan gedaan om terug in de wedstrijd te komen dat toont onze mentale sterkte we speelden met veel lef en enthousiasme helaas ontbrak het ons weeral aan effici ntie het verhaal van ons toernooi eigenlijk
6805864 al bij al mogen we over een geslaagde campagne spreken niemand had gedacht dat we hier de halve finale zouden halen dus qua resultaat is het zeker positief ook qua manier van spelen zijn we als technische staf zeer tevreden zowel uit binnen als buitenland kregen we daar positieve kritiek over te horen

6805880 man bemerkt gar nicht dass man auf einer br cke f hrt

6805882 wenn man im auto mit einer bestimmten geschwindigkeit auf die kurve zufliegt ist das immer etwas anderes
6805883 unsere arbeit war ziemlich gut und genau wir hatten von anfang an eine gute balance und mussten nur kleine ver nderungen vornehmen nichts dramatisches
6805884 wenn wir morgen so weitermachen sollten wir in einer guten verfassung f r das qualifying sein
6805885 wir haben an der balance gearbeitet und konnten jedes mal wenn wir auf der strecke waren etwas neues lernen jetzt versuchen wir das puzzle zusammenzusetzen
6805886 trotz der blichen unbekannten am freitag w rde ich sagen dass wir konkurrenzf hig sind
6805887 die strecke ist noch sehr schmutzig und es ist leicht fehler zu machen und wertvolle zehntel zu verlieren
6805888 demnach muss man perfekt fahren um eine gute rundenzeit hinzulegen

6805894 throsby has produced some fine work in the past but this is her best by a long shot
6805895 superb lyricism and subtly rich oaky instrumentation effortlessly veering from bright folk pop to spare almost ambient acoustic laments

6805897 in spite of economic constraints in some markets like the united states on a worldwide basis servers continued to grow
6805898 the most significant driver in the quarter continued to be an upswing in x86 server replacements that started in the first quarter this coupled with web data centre build outs and growth in emerging markets produced solid q2 results
6805899 it is stating the obvious that humans walk upright whilst baboons use all four limbs in addition humans are much larger than even the largest baboon objectively speaking therefore humans can be effortlessly distinguished from baboons
6805900 testified that on the fateful day whilst driving his motor vehicle on the farm and seated behind the steering wheel he had blindly blindelings fired two shots into the bush in an attempt to scare off baboons that had crossed his path according to the appellant the baboons were a nuisance and repeatedly caused damage to structures at the game lodge on the farm he had fired the two shots shortly after sunrise whilst travelling eastwards and the sun had impaired his view

6805916 in this regard the recent decline in commodity prices as well as the increased stability of the dollar has been encouraging
6805917 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year
6805918 as an industry we were playing catch up selling only four and five megapixel camera phones
6805919 but the eight megapixel is a new milestone i think the vast majority of consumers will see it as credible alternative for first time ever you will not need to carry camera as well as a phone on your holidays
6805920 now camera phones are competing head on the entry level digital still cameras
6805921 some claim that the arrival of such high quality camera phones could drive the final nail into the coffin of digital camera seller jessops which last month announced its latest profit warning
6805922 given fannie maes and freddie macs importance to the u s mortgage market we believe there is a very high level of support for their debt from the u s treasury
6805923 and given these government sponsored entities more limited ability to raise capital and grow their portfolio to accomplish their public policy role in a time of mortgage market turmoil we believe that theres an increased probability of actual support coming from the u s treasury

6805944 hate to tell you this but when the secret service agent went into the classroom the president had no recourse other than to sit and wait the secret service is in charge of security for the president they have total control he could not have left the room if he wanted to in the few minutes idiots like yourself say he was doing nothing the secret service was secring a route back to the airport air force one was being readied for flight a pair of fighter jets were being scrambled to escort air force one the choice for a secure destination was being made the officer with the nuclear football

6805959 my readers may not understand where im getting at with this
6805960 tags and separate your posts up and can make it easier for readers and new coming visitors to search through your blog and find what they really want
6805961 argue it until you are blue in the face but this blog band proved that we music blogs actually get it right some times
6805962 i dont really know if ive ever realized that they were blowing up
6805963 just been really busy for the last three years its good to be busy
6805964 heres a charismatic playfully slipshod band unconcerned with making all the loose ends meet up audacious enough to leave the dot connecting to us
6805965 tapes n tapes kneel before pavement wire beach boys and pixies bearing their influences more publicly than notebook logo sketches but facing the task of averting obviousness they play the uncool card
6805966 really didnt have an agenda other than us being happy with how the record turned out and helping us realize what we had in our brains
6805967 wed just play stuff and put mics in the room usually it didnt take too many tries before it was yep thats how we want it to sound
6805968 the sounds he gets hes amazing first and foremost hes just a really amazing engineer
6805969 for some reason there is a misconception that he really has a heavy hand in how things are produced or like really affects how bands operate at least in our experience he just kind of enabled us to get to where we wanted to be
6805970 i really like how things sound on vinyl and really want to hear things the way theyre supposed to sound it was really important how it sounded and the quality of it when it got compressed down to mp3 really didnt represent how we wanted it to sound things got really crunchy in a way that they werent supposed to be the record is pretty overdriven and when you compress it into mp3 format it kind of gets mushy sometimes the idea was when we were mixing it in the studio this is how it sounds and this is how we intended it to sound
6805971 it seems like theres less bands right now that im noticing that are getting a big communal push from blogs
6805972 it was a time when music blogs were this new thing and all of a sudden people were starting to look there for bands
6805973 we were really fortunate to be at the right time for that stuff
6805974 when i go back home its nice to be able to do something thats totally unrelated to the band
6805975 i go in for a couple days a week and do some data analysis
6805976 more than anything if i didnt have any sort of a job when we were home id probably be pretty bored
6805977 i totally understand the allure of quitting the day job it is nice to have health care though
6805978 we lost 20 per cent of our customers in the first week
6805979 so i have this great story about a wireless transmitter that can detect submarines from 300 miles
6805980 er yeah but you know we dont write about those on techcrunch right
6805981 can htc touch pro live up to the hype i think it can it is by far the best phone i have tested i think it is a great size not too big or too small it has all the functionality and speed that i need day to day the price tag well anything worth buying is invariably not cheap and this is no exception it is relatively expensive in the pda world but it is probably the best on the market at this time
6805982 to make sure that a second record is even going to happen this album needs to get off the ground and we need to tour to support it
6805983 we had been talking about recording in the fall probably since april or may
6805984 its hard to say that we knew thats what we needed to do but thats what we felt we should be doing is continuing on sometimes even after that it was hard to know whether we were doing the right thing
6805985 john offered a lot of ideas in terms of melodic ideas or chord structures or lyrics he was a huge part of the songwriting process
6805986 build a library of musical instruments for underprivileged kids or amateurs
6805987 its modeled after what john was like as a person
6805988 sounds a bit more cohesive as a full unit and maybe a little more developed we had a little more time to figure out the sound of the individual instruments or the songs themselves
6805989 we were exploring the spectrum of sonic possibilities and trying to come up with a good balance
6805990 nothing that we were too interested in doing were waiting until the right one comes along
6805991 politicians love to turn their stories into great epics and sometimes they have to embellish to smooth out the story line
6805992 but now there are too many professional and amateur fact checkers
6805993 and there are hundreds if not thousands of bloggers who have detailed knowledge on specialized information so you really cant get away with stretching the truth anymore
6805994 mother teresa convinced cindy to take two babies in need of medical attention to the united states one of those babies is now their adopted daughter 16 year old bridget mccain

6805996 the very hospital and in the very room where her husband was brought after being shot down and then beaten by a mob during the war
6805997 mrs mccain asked to see the operating room and her husbands cell but was turned down she took the rejection philosophically its 27 years later lets go on mrs mccain said
6805998 at some point thereafter she toured the hospital and did coincidentally end up in the senators room
6805999 everybody tells white lies but in the political world its a little different because it raises the question that if people lie about little things are they also going to lie about big stuff that really matters

6806003 right now the situation is still getting worse and i would say that i dont see any early end to that
6806004 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6806005 that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth

6806017 reading some of the entries for this blog a thon i found myself jealous
6806018 i felt a twinge when referring to a line by james deans jim stark jamie
6806019 i realized ive never had that experience ive never had such a direct connection to a movie character
6806020 i dont know the first thing about acting set design costume design and lighting are not things i generally pay attention to my exposure to the classics of cinema is spotty my understanding of the mechanics of cinematography and direction doesnt exist
6806021 i have long called myself a structuralist and i use that term casually and carelessly largely ignorant of its intellectual history
6806022 what i mean by structuralism is an interest above all else in the way a movie is put together not just its linearity or nonlinearity but its component parts their arrangement the emphasis placed on them within the work and how all those elements play off each other
6806023 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next

6806059 we the undersigned urge you to declare a moratorium on immigration raids in the state of rhode island until our nation can implement a comprehensive and just reform of our immigration laws
6806060 it is our hope that such reform will make immigration raids obsolete until then we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counter productive
6806061 as religious leaders we understand and support the need to apprehend and arrest individuals who are responsible for felonies and other serious crimes the enforcement of just laws is necessary for public safety and the common good but the arrest of serious criminals is not what we have observed in the arrest and detention of immigrants that has taken place recently in our state particularly in newport and in providence
6806062 what we have witnessed is that the police action of ice against immigrants has divided the community instilled fear in our streets disrupted the everyday life of good people and separated family members innocent of any crime from one another
6806063 the confusing and secretive detention of those arrested has further complicated the situation as religious leaders concerned for our people we would be negligent of our pastoral duties if we didnt speak out against these unjust government policies and practices
6806064 we encourage the agents and staff of ice to evaluate the morality of their participation in immigration raids in the context of their faith and sanctity of their conscience
6806065 if their discernment leads them to the conclusion that they cannot participate in such raids in good conscience we urge them not to do so if ice agents refuse to participate in immigration raids in conformity with their faith and conscience we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection

6806071 if they dont give us sufficient time to prepare a meaningful and competitive proposal theres a strong likelihood that we would no bid

6806081 today rep hoyer has finally given the american people a glimpse of the majoritys long promised energy plan
6806082 the american people support more american energy to bring down the price at the pump and this latest proposal from the out of touch democratic leadership is just added proof of how far democrats are willing to go to continue defying their will house republicans will continue our nationwide gas prices protest from the house floor to communities across the nation to hold speaker pelosi rep hoyer and their democratic counterparts accountable for their refusal to allow a vote on a meaningful energy plan to lower gas prices its time for democratic leaders to stop offering their hollow no energy proposals and allow a vote on the house republicans all of the above american energy act
6806083 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6806084 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6806085 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6806086 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6806087 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6806111 there was never any real dispute as to what occurred nor that we were investigating alleged criminal conduct this is obviously the conclusion reached by the attorney general
6806112 we continue to believe that the federal case is strong and we intend to proceed to trial on all claims including violation of state privacy law which is certainly not foreclosed simply because the attorney general decided not to indict

6806196 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice
6806197 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6806198 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6806199 now its up to the icc to take a decision which they would take on sunday but i would say that south africas refusal will badly hurt the event we will still do our best to save the event and host it on schedule
6806200 we made the best security arrangements for south africa when they toured us last year and it was only at the end that they did not want to play in karachi so we relocated the match to multan
6806201 the icc has noted csas decision and will not make any further comment until the icc board meeting on sunday

6806253 the tarrant county district attorney has filed hate crimes against ms head so this proves once again that mayor cluck is still in deep denial of what arlington is really like for people of color
6806254 since the debut of televised presidential debates in 1960 the job of questioning candidates and refereeing exchanges has been handled exclusively by figures from the news media
6806255 their professional imperatives are simple be tough break news and do it fast thats an appropriate mission for a 20 inch a1 story or a lead segment on the evening news but in a political forum setting the quest for a scoop and the sloganeering defensiveness it engenders on the part of the candidates has led to gatherings long on cant and short on illumination

6806281 on one occasion when i was in one of the prayer meetings some of the attendees asked if i wanted them to pray for me i told them no because i did not see that god answered their prayers
6806282 on further reading of my bible it struck me that their prayers were not answered because they did not comply with the conditions upon which god had promised to answer prayer they did not pray in faith in the sense of expecting god to give them the thing for which they asked
6806283 there is incredible enthusiasm for barack obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6806284 we can assure our supporters these texts did not come from the campaign and their data is secure everyone can also rest easy that despite their popularity mickey mouse and michael phelps are not on the short list at this time

6806286 we are proud to help cause confusion and excitement during this terrible boring week of no news at all
6806287 but we cant really take too much credit for it apparently one of our readers listens to howard stern which is still on the radio and heard of the veep txt hoax and figured out an easy way to do it through verizons txt website

6806291 the questions that come up every day are not addressed at all by this upgrade
6806292 this is just really more of tinkering around the edges
6806293 this news has come as a great shock to everyone including it seems his own wife and family
6806294 michael has confirmed that he is not suffering with a terminal illness and is seeking professional help in adelaide with the support of his family we are asking our church to pray for the guglielmucci family during this difficult time
6806295 the national executive is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him
6806296 we are very concerned for the many people who have been or will be hurt by michaels actions
6806297 given how hard adults find it to cope with a series like big brother to put children in that environment is asking for trouble theres a danger this could leave children traumatised
6806298 the parents thought it was an incredibly positive experience for their kids to go through we were taking them away for two weeks so they were highly monitored
6806299 we wanted to see what happens if the parents were not there
6806300 you are just left with this positive feeling that these kids are wonderful weve got this generation here of brilliant kids if theyre let loose theyre brilliant
6806301 the safety of the kids was absolutely paramount there were security guards chaperones production staff and cctv for the parents
6806302 if its intended to be educational then its a good thing but i dont think it will be
6806303 im sure the programme will serve no useful purpose and will simply be voyeuristic and low grade entertainment
6806304 when big brother first came on the scene we were told it was an observational documentary and we would obtain psychological data that it would be a step forward in finding out about relationships
6806305 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6806306 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6806307 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6806308 we are currently doing extensive testing with irradiation and it looks to be very promising
6806309 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6806310 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational time tables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6806311 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6806312 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6806313 but people just kept dropping them off and dropping them off

6806320 indians tend to buy the most fancy cell phones and the iphone has a massive fan following everywhere
6806321 it is seen as a status symbol an aspirational product so you can expect to see not just the rich but also tech savvy youngsters and people in small towns buying it
6806322 we cant change phones on a daily basis we have to keep the future in mind and 3g will come to india soon
6806323 i think i just left it all on the curve

6806330 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6806331 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6806332 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6806333 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise

6806348 we need to adjust the car balance so we will have to look into it tonight
6806349 the most important thing is how much the surface will change during the weekend
6806350 the asphalt is quite smooth and while it was predictably slippery today the grip should improve so it will be hard to get the set up right
6806351 the first practice was a bit difficult and the track was very dusty but we expected that
6806352 the afternoon was much better and the car got more and more into the set up window
6806353 i hope we can keep going in this direction because it has been a productive day
6806354 we went out on new tyres fairly early on and the track ramped up a lot towards the end of the session so its difficult to really tell but i think the track is suiting our car
6806355 we will have to wait and see what happens tomorrow and in the race
6806356 in terms of set up we made a considerable improvement today which is good
6806357 the organisers have done a fantastic job valencia is a great track
6806358 it has a pretty smooth surface and its going to be a pleasure to race here
6806359 we lost a set of tyres with nico following his spin and were obviously lucky to get away without any car damage
6806360 otherwise weve run through our programme and have collected good information on tyres while doing long runs so were happy with the work weve done today
6806361 the long runs were good but we need to find a bit more pace when were out on new tyres
6806362 conditions were changing all the time and the track became easier to drive as the sessions progressed
6806363 its not the easiest of circuits so im pleased i did lots of preparation work on the simulator before i arrived
6806364 of course at the start the track was extremely dirty but obviously the conditions are the same for everybody
6806365 we had no technical problems and i was able to do the tyre comparison as planned
6806366 im not happy with the lap times yet so now we shall look into the data and figure out how we can improve
6806367 the surface was still very dirty in the morning so we had to wait until the track picked up some grip
6806368 in the second free practice the conditions were better although it was still quite slippery and our main focus was on tyre evaluation and basic set up work
6806369 because of this it is quite tricky to make a prediction for tomorrow we now have to analyse the data
6806370 although this is a new track there were no surprises for us as regards the cars set up
6806371 the circuit is as we expected and we were well prepared
6806372 because we cannot use any previous information to refer to for this new track we shall now analyse all the data
6806373 we were struggling with very low grip this morning and im sure that was the same for everyone out there
6806374 the track is very dusty and if you go off line your tyres are quickly covered in dirt which makes it difficult to be consistent
6806375 we made a lot of changes to the car this afternoon which have proved positive and provided a great deal of useful information to study this evening
6806376 it was nice to do a quick lap at the end on the option tyre
6806377 hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow
6806378 we had a good morning session and i felt the car was quite well balanced but this afternoon it was almost like i had a completely different car
6806379 we changed some parts for the session and unfortunately they had a real impact on the cars performance which along with some braking concerns meant that we were unable to progress
6806380 im confident that we can resolve these concerns overnight and get back on the pace for qualifying tomorrow
6806381 jenson has obviously done a good job today and is looking extremely competitive
6806382 rubens has some braking problems that we have had to live with during the session because there wasnt sufficient time to fix them
6806383 if we can resolve this issue then there is no reason to think that both cars cant be quite closely matched during the rest of the weekend
6806384 i think we have done a good job here in valencia so far but credit should also go to the rest of the team for all the hard work that was achieved off track during the three week break
6806385 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
6806386 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
6806387 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
6806388 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
6806389 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
6806390 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world
6806391 a copyright bill apple boss steve jobs didnt like calling it
6806392 a draft law passed by frances national assembly would have barred apple or anyone else such as microsoft from trying to force people into buying a particular product through so called digital rights management drm measures
6806393 softens some measures that could have forced apple to open all music sold from its itunes music store to play on portable devices other than the apple ipod
6806394 theres also a provision in the senate version that may allow apple not to share its drm at all it could go to the digital copyright agency and make the case that its technology is not designed to protect apple but rather the musicians whose music it sells the french are extremely protective of the droit dauteur if the agency agrees that apple is simply protecting the rolling stones britney spears and other artists it may not need to turn over the fairplay software code
6806395 any time something like this bill happens any time that we believe that intellectual property rights are being violated we need to speak up and in this case the company is taking the initiative
6806396 under it apple gets into major teaching institutions with apple ipods and itunes which are spuriously presented as important teaching aids and which are promoted and sold on apples behalf by unpaid school staffs
6806397 in the us duke university was to the fore as well with stanford close behind it doesnt stop with ipods in kutztown ny for example students are forced to use apple laptops at school whether they want to or not
6806398 started a collaboration with the first french teaching unit for a similar arrangement
6806399 under the terms of the two year partnership apple will work closely with a business school near versailles on integrating ipods and other digital technology into classrooms and curricula

6806401 but no surprises really stanford one of americas most prestigious universities is after all apple land enjoying a warm and cozy relationship with the company
6806402 it admitted doing a deal which in effect turned the university into an apple itunes promotional outfit
6806403 taking a step that professors may view as a bit counterproductive some universities are doling out apple iphones and internet capable ipods to students
6806404 the always on internet devices raise some novel possibilities like tracking where students congregate with far less controversy colleges could send messages about canceled classes delayed buses campus crises or just the cafeteria menu
6806405 basking in the aura of a cutting edge product could just help a university foster a cutting edge reputation
6806406 apple stands to win as well hooking more young consumers with decades of technology purchases ahead of them the lone losers some fear could be professors
6806407 the newest devices can take class distractions to a new level
6806408 they practically beg a user to ignore the long suffering professor struggling to pass on accumulated wisdom from the front of the room a prospect that teachers find galling and students view as well inevitable
6806409 because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out

6806413 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
6806414 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
6806415 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
6806416 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
6806417 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
6806418 because time consumption is associated with emotional experiences thinking about donating time reminds people of the happiness achieved through helping others
6806419 we argue that thinking about time activates goals of well being and beliefs involving personal happiness in contrast thinking about money suppresses such emotional goals and instead activates goals of economic utility and beliefs about attainment of such goals

6806421 as i said before brandon is not a sociopath this is not some crazy kid
6806422 what i am trying to establish given the mandatory harsh sentencing that goes with trying a 14 year old as an adult is explaining what was going on how this tragedy happened not trying to minimize it or take anything away from the tragedy but at least provide it in the context which we think would provide a partial defense on behalf of brandon

6806439 ncbs sponsorship of al qaeda flowed largely although not exclusively through muwafaq foundation
6806440 plaintiffs offer only speculation and hearsay in their effort to link ncb to al qaeda terrorists who committed the sept 11 attacks
6806441 mr kadis actions and those of his muwafaq foundation and businesses give rise to a reasonable basis to believe that they have facilitated terrorist activities
6806442 there is little doubt that a financial conduit to bin laden was handled through the national commercial bank

6806450 i dont have any personal vendetta or anything i just want to win for my teammates my family and my country
6806451 i have a lot of great friends on the american team and basketballs a sport sports my life definitely and ive put so much time and effort into it
6806452 anyone that we play ive got coaches or friends playing against us so its not personal at all
6806453 but i know they are the no 1 team in the world and weve got to really push it to get through that and were going to give it everything that we have
6806454 i expect it to be even more physical why wouldnt you
6806455 its a gold medal game and were just as physical we give as much as we get and youre playing for a lot all the sacrifices you make throughout your career
6806456 for the last two olympics its been the us against the opals so for us its the third time around the track
6806457 of course were desperate i mean why wouldnt we be desperate
6806458 but the reality is you have to apply process youve got to go out and take care of business on the court so taking emotion into the game is not the right way
6806459 youve got to have a lot of passion about wanting to do the right things but we cant be emotional about it
6806460 im sure they the us are recognising its going to be a fairly serious encounter and hopefully for the public and the game its just a great spectacle of great athletes on court in a great battle
6806461 were going to have to produce our a game of the tournament without question we have to make things happen for us
6806462 the accomplishment of setting goals and achieving or failing to achieve the goals on their own
6806463 less assertive possibly less competent and more eager to conform
6806464 if i try this this might happen but if i do this
6806465 should i walk in with you do you want me to stay
6806466 the wet track is a major concern and i think it will be too short for him
6806467 were just playing it by ear but obviously his performances will improve when he gets over more ground
6806468 obviously weight is the issue and were just going to take it one race at a time and see what happens
6806469 i would certainly say this time last year when master oreilly and douro valley were lining up for the spring i was no more confident with them than i would be with him
6806470 in march there was a big go for him when he won the bunbury cup
6806471 then when he was transferred to danny obriens stable the punters came again
6806472 he is still a juicy price as there are some question marks over whether the horse will qualify
6806473 we were pushing pretty hard to try and maintain our second place there and we actually got called back
6806474 so by the time we got back to the start and then headed back out we were probably half a leg behind most of the other boats so we played catch up for the rest of the race
6806475 it has been really successful for us we go pretty well in all conditions and its been a pretty blowy series and our boat goes well in a blow
6806476 we got a heat win and a bunch of thirds and a second and that was enough to get us second
6806477 ill be directed by the medical staff before making a decision

6806487 door de economische onzekerheid kozen kopers van een woning ervoor om de rente lang vast te zetten en geen gebruik te maken van variabele rente
6806488 je moet dan denken aan hypotheken met een looptijd van tenminste vijf jaar de rente hiervan is hoger maar ze bieden wel meer zekerheid
6806489 de variabele rente is de laatste jaren duidelijk in populariteit gedaald
6806490 huizenkopers legden hun hypotheken voor langdurige periodes vast overigens zie je de laatste maanden weer een lichte kentering op dit gebied en worden de hypotheekperiodes weer wat korter
6806491 er was angst dat partijen uit het midden oosten en azi afhaakten als investeerders in de westerse financi le markten als dat zou gebeuren zou een bank als lehman brothers een serieuze kandidaat zijn om het loodje te leggen dit bericht helpt dus enorm
6806492 het herstel van de afgelopen weken heeft no legs zouden de amerikanen zeggen de belegger moet er rekening mee houden dat er nog slecht nieuws zal komen uit de economie en de financi le sector een stijging van tien punten kan nog best maar een stand van 440 450 punten acht ik niet waarschijnlijk
6806493 het sentiment is vandaag gewoon erg goed maar het is een beetje jantje lach jantje huilt er hoeft maar dit te gebeuren en de koersen gaan weer onderuit

6806497 i usually just come on and do my job i suppose
6806498 i just do whats right for the team whatever the team needs ill do
6806499 theyll be pushing for a top eight spot so itll be tough but we need to put in some good performances
6806500 theyll be tough games for us to get up for especially the teams were playing but ive got no doubt we can
6806501 het is zaak dat we met elkaar in gesprek blijven zodat schiphol goed kan functioneren
6806502 it was a disappointment to lose to scott taylor who is a great player but i didnt think he played as well as mark did in the first game
6806503 ive really got to prove myself and theyre the players that ive got to beat when i go out in those sort of events
6806504 overall ambition i want to play commonwealth games and win a gold medal i wish it was an olympic sport
6806505 i was naturally pleased to get through the first game i bowled all right in the first game
6806506 the white mouse ignatz loves to hate krazy but only as long as he she is black black krazy loves ignatz only as long as hes white
6806507 but im getting closer every day when i get the go ahead i guarantee ill be back in great shape and hopefully in a position to make an immediate impact for
6806508 the longer you are out the more you appreciate what it means to play at the top level and theres no doubt in my mind ill be back bigger and better than ever
6806509 the operation went well but the rehabilitation has taken a little longer than id have liked
6806510 when youre injured you dont really feel a part of things but ive always been a positive person
6806511 when i was a youngster in australia people didnt really rate me but i never took no for an answer ive always liked to prove people wrong
6806512 i was looking for a new challenge and when arsenal came in for me i couldnt refuse it was a very good surprise
6806513 his experience will bring a lot to the squad and he will hopefully add some goals to the side he is known for scoring them as well as creating them
6806514 im really pleased to join a good club with good players
6806515 sunderland is a club i think is going to achieve things they have big ambitions thats why i chose to come here i liked what the club had to say to me
6806516 external review did not support all the interpretations made in the correspondence
6806517 the decision not to publish in this case was made by the editorial executive committee and a full explanation was given to the authors
6806518 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6806519 one of the things i liked most after the game was the team was disappointed with the draw even though we had a spectacular game and we dominated
6806520 that feeling after the game means we are willing to achieve high levels even if we are away we want to win because we have a great group
6806521 that kind of feeling and attitude means the team wants to be better and not satisfied even if we win a game we have to come to practice and work on the things we dont do well on the field thats the kind of attitude that makes a team a champion
6806522 theres friendship but if we want to win and i have to get angry i will
6806523 even if my father doesnt do the things we practice you have to punish him
6806524 die stra en haben einen guten rhythmus und sind so eben dass man sich keine sorgen machen muss das auto oder die reifen an losen steinen zu besch digen
6806525 die berh hten kurven laden zum attackieren ein aber es ist wichtig das auto eingangs der kurven auf der richtigen seite des gef lles zu platzieren wer die neigung der stra e falsch erwischt kommt quer muss einen weiten bogen fahren oder schafft die kurve berhaupt nicht
6806526 das reglement besagt dass wir hier nur einen reifentyp einsetzen d rfen bei k lte und regen wird es schwierig die harten reifen auf die optimale temperatur zu bringen
6806527 falls es so kommt werde ich vermutlich zun chst vorsichtig agieren auf der anderen seite bin ich auf der ersten wp in argentinien bei solchen verh ltnissen viel risiko eingegangen und habe eine top zeit erzielt genauso gut kann man aber auch von der strecke rutschen ermutigend sind die verbesserungen am motor die sich in deutschland definitiv bew hrt haben
6806528 ich mag diese rallye und nach der entt uschung in deutschland tut es gut wieder auf strecken zu fahren die mir liegen

6806532 worth mentioning is that the movie was directed by the limp bizkit frontman fred durst
6806533 unfortunately director fred durst blends all of these time honored components with the same skill level that he brought to the stage with his crappy band limp bizkit
6806534 a surprisingly tepid directorial effort by limp bizkit nu metal rocker fred durst pic seldom deviates from the genre cliche playbook
6806535 in the 90s ice cube and limp bizkit co headlined the family values tour as respectively a rap legend and the nadir of music up to that point cube and bizkit frontman cum filmmaker fred durst reteam for the longshots canceling each other out into total mediocrity
6806536 ive started dating sharon stone and shes pretty good for 50

6806539 after much hard work a little digital elbow grease and in conjunction with our publishing partner meridian4 dialogue design is thrilled to announce that today is the day for the release of our much awaited indie tank blasting title tank universal
6806540 interest has been strong in the lead up to the games release and we would like to thank all those who pre ordered and to wish everyone good luck and good aiming in the virtual tank battles ahead
6806541 as i have stated before we instantly took a liking to tank universal when it was shown to us its unique look its gameplay features and the fun factor were all present now that gamers and the press have a chance to play it i know itll become an instant indie classic
6806542 birth of america was very well received by critics and strategy fans alike the sequel to this fantastic gaming system comes loaded with new features and expanded possibilities making birth of america 2 wars in america a must have for american revolutionary war buffs and turn based grand strategy fans alike
6806543 we hung too many breaking balls and that was our downfall and we couldnt get anything going offensively i thought stephen strasburg was throwing the ball exceptionally well but he had 75 pitches after four innings hes got too good a future ahead of him i didnt want him to go out there and labor at all in the fifth we were in good position we just didnt hold them we made too many mistakes
6806544 we put up two runs early and really didnt get anything going as a hitter i take the blame for how the game went along stephen strasburg pitched a pretty solid game the few mistakes that we had you cant make those in these big games you have to come out and pretty much be perfect and today we werent
6806545 yo get her outta here big said they led kim out of the room and she screamed and cursed the whole way
6806546 i feel that all the good work ive done out here has gone down the pan
6806547 he caught me cold in the first round we thought hed box off the backfoot but he came out and surprised me
6806548 i dont know what happened in there i expected to go in and dominate
6806549 im so disappointed but no one can take my bronze medal away from me and it has been a fantastic journey
6806550 to try and make london 2012 as a synchro swimmer after that performance actually i just fancy a haircut and a chinese
6806551 im devastated i feel ive let the whole of sunderland down
6806552 i cannot take anything away from kenny he beat me fair and square and on the day boxed brilliantly i had a miracle performance in the quarters and i just wish i could have had another miracle performance here tonight
6806553 with three of us about to box in the semi finals
6806554 yes hes lost twice to the cuban but those fights were preparation for these olympics
6806555 james has fought four times here and each time hes just got better and better hes a bundle of fun to be around and a real class act
6806556 ive so much respect for him and if hes not around no more you wont see me fighting in london 2012
6806557 obviously his strategists met on the portico of the mccain estate in sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses and decided what line of attack they were going to use
6806558 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6806559 in addition to notions of social equality there was much emphasis on the role of elites and of heroes within them

6806594 we have many outstanding faculty scholars and we want to showcase the books resulting from their research and creative work
6806595 our fall campaign is to contact all who have donated books to president watson for display in his office and request they also participate in the library web site
6806596 individual authors may add their own information or contact me for more information
6806597 if a book is available in the msu libraries a link from the authors web site to the catalog entry in the librarys automated system will allow easy access to the requested publication
6806598 for me its an honor to display this tangible evidence of scholarly output across a range of disciplines and decades
6806599 im hopeful both the faculty authors web site the library maintains and the collection in my office will provide an enduring record of faculty contributions

6806603 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6806604 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6806605 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6806606 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor

6806608 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6806609 oh i have a product you just have to try
6806610 you have to come in here and look at this sweater it would look great on you
6806611 the first factor people notice about the car is the styling its a refreshing and innovative design that is unlike anything else on the market so its totally unique the styling also serves a real technical purpose as its aerodynamic features were designed to aid road holding in terms of driving experience we wanted to ensure no stone was left unturned and we feel the result will appeal to drivers who really want to feel part of the car whether on track or on the road
6806612 weve developed a strong team from design through to production our laminating department for instance consists of craftsmen who honed their skills as part of the luxury yacht building industry for which the local area is famous so the care and exacting standards they integrate into their work and the quality they produce is second to none additionally we plan to bring in local apprentices via an agreement with cornwall college to the automotive engineering industry which brings in fresh thinking which will aid future projects
6806613 i was able to take advantage of the three hours of practice today to complete plenty of laps and gather lots of interesting data which will be useful for the rest of my weekend i really like the track and its a lot of fun in the car the level of grip was poor but we are used to this sort of thing on street circuits i will now work with my engineers to optimise the setup of the car so that we can have a good final free practice session tomorrow morning and approach qualifying in good shape
6806614 it has been interesting learning and adapting to this new circuit during todays practice sessions we completed our programme of learning the circuit the car and the tyres as expected the grip level was very low to begin with and developed through both sessions it is difficult to understand too much about our situation relative to the others but we had no significant problems which is encouraging for the rest of the weekend

6806636 we need to adjust the car balance so we will have to look into it tonight the track is good though and i like it
6806637 you need to find a compromise on setup because there is a mix of slow corners and higher speed sections with long straights the most important thing is how much the surface will change during the weekend
6806638 the asphalt is quite smooth and while it was predictably slippery today the grip should improve so it will be hard to get the setup right
6806639 its always enjoyable to come to a new venue and im impressed
6806640 it was pretty hot out there but the track is good fun and the layout is interesting
6806641 i like street circuits because i raced on so many of them during my time racing champ car in america but apart from the harbour and the buildings this doesnt really look like a street circuit because it has long straights
6806642 the first practice was a bit difficult and the track was very dusty but we expected that
6806643 its always enjoyable to come to a new venue and im impressed it was pretty hot out there but the track is good fun and the layout is interesting i like street circuits because i raced on so many of them during my time racing champ car in america but apart from the harbour and the buildings this doesnt really look like a street circuit because it has long straights we had a good day the first practice was a bit difficult and the track was very dusty but we expected that the afternoon was much better and the car got more and more into the setup window i hope we can keep going in this direction because it has been a productive day
6806644 that was not a particularly good day for me we need to adjust the car balance so we will have to look into it tonight the track is good though and i like it in karting we used to race on a lot of street circuits so learning it doesnt take long but you need to find a compromise on setup because there is a mix of slow corners and higher speed sections with long straights the most important thing is how much the surface will change during the weekend the asphalt is quite smooth and while it was predictably slippery today the grip should improve so it will be hard to get the setup right
6806645 you have to say on the right side of the white line and today i was not one time it was my mistake
6806646 from the outside it is more difficult to see who is going into the pits than it is on the inside but when a car goes in front of you into the pits you see he brakes a little bit later and when you go to the pits you brake late
6806647 de olympische droom is voorbij we hebben gefaald nu een dag na de race heb ik het nog moeilijk om het een plaats te geven en het zal nog wel een tijdje duren als je 4 jaren naar zon moment toeleeft komen er best wel wat emoties naar boven en ik heb dan ook nu al spijt voor enkele van mijn reacties van boosheid die in de media werden uitvergroot ik had beter moeten weten mijn excuses daarvoor
6806648 ik vind ook dat iedereen mag weten dat ik ontzettend dankbaar ben voor de steun van ontzettend veel mensen mijn coach carlos met zijn doorgedreven motivatie en kennis om het beste in me boven te halen mijn krachttrainer marc en de medische begeleiding mijn mental coach rudy en nog vele anderen die ik hier vergeten ben professioneel nooit eerder voelde ik me op een enorme professionele manier ondersteund en zowel bloso als het boic de vlaamse overheid en enkele belangrijke sponsoren hebben ervoor gezorgd dat alle middelen en mogelijkheden voor een ideale opbouw hiernaartoe werden gegarandeerd ik kan enkel voor mezelf spreken als ik zeg dat mijn omkadering en de instanties al het mogelijke hebben gedaan om hier optimaal te presteren
6806649 maar het is niet gelukt en ik neem mijn verantwoordelijkheid op ik heb gefaald om een succesvol team te vormen met kevin ik vind het dan ook vreselijk dat ik niets heb kunnen terugdoen aan iedereen die zoveel energie en moeite in ons hebben gestoken buiten mijn ouders familie en vrienden wil ik iedereen graag bedanken voor alle berichtjes die ik van velen onder jullie kreeg ik voelde me ontzettend gesteund in de aanloop naar mijn olympische race
6806650 its my first time on a street circuit so im really pleased to finish the day quickest
6806651 its great fun you get really close to the walls and i think i managed to find the limit in the second session
6806652 i think theres a little more to come well look to see if we can make any improvements before qualifying tomorrow but its a good start to the weekend
6806653 the trend in naming pets is going toward more human names
6806654 they can really pick up on them it gets too complicated with more than that but give a name with a punch to it
6806655 any pet as soon as they can id their name that is the first step in training
6806656 she is a husky i wanted something to do with nature but as she was a member of my family too i just wanted her to have a name that a person could have too
6806657 ella is a name i have always liked and in my job as a name expert compiling data and giving advice about baby names to people all the time it is one that i had seen that i really liked
6806658 it is a very popular name though and one that i wouldnt use for a child of my own only because i see so many little ellas and bellas being named every day
6806659 dogs before were used for work on the farm and different occupations people would keep them outside in a dog house
6806660 nowadays they are in the house even sleeping in the bed sometimes
6806661 also think about that you will be calling it this all the time so you dont want it to be some long crazy name
6806662 i just got a new rabbit what should i call him
6806663 sie ist anders als andere stra en kurse die wir kennen als ich gestern die strecke ablief da dachte ich mir schon dass sie spa machen k nnte und heute hat sich dieser eindruck best tigt es gibt ein paar sehr schnelle stellen und fast berall gibt es eine menge raum vielleicht hnlich einiger der nordamerikanischen strecken die in der vergangenheit verwendet wurden sie haben wirklich gute arbeit geleistet
6806664 heute erwischten wir einen guten start in das wochenende aber nat rlich ist es noch viel zu fr h um zu sagen wo wir im vergleich zu den gegnern stehen berholen das wird wie immer schwierig sein ich hoffe dass ich dies nicht tun muss indem ich im qualifying die beste position erziele das setup das wir heute gefunden haben ist nicht schlecht aber es gibt noch jede menge raum f r verbesserungen
6806665 es gab zwei genussvoller einheiten in denen die rundenzeiten st ck f r st ck sanken w hrend die fahrer ihre runden drehten und zuversicht in das layout der strecke fassten
6806666 der asphalt ist immer noch sehr schmutzig und es f llt leicht fehler zu machen bei denen man wertvolle zehntelsekunden verlieren kann man muss perfekt sein um eine gute rundenzeiten erzielen
6806667 ich mag die strecke es herrscht eine nette atmosph re und ich muss sagen dass die organisatoren gute arbeit geleistet haben heute war es wichtig sofort ein gutes basis setup zu finden das haben wir geschafft
6806668 alles in allem war dies ein guter start in der valencia wochenende
6806669 es war wichtig mit dem richtigen fu aufzustehen das haben wir geschafft wir haben ein basis setup f r den f2008 entwickelt und dies scheint richtig zu sein was bedeutete dass wir uns schon vom morgen an verbessern konnten beide fahrer sind mit dem verhalten des autos ganz zufrieden
6806670 nun m ssen wir alle daten analysieren die wir gesammelt haben um herauszuarbeiten wie wir fortschritte erzielen k nnen um die beste leistung herauszuholen heute war die strecke sehr schmutzig was jedoch vorherzusagen war die beiden bridgestone reifen typen zeigten in bezug auf ihre leistung keinen gro artigen unterschied
6806671 wir arbeiteten gut und sammelten ber diese strecke eine menge daten die wir nun w hrend der kommenden paar stunden verwenden werden um uns so gut wie m glich auf dieses wochenende vorzubereiten
6806672 auf basis dessen was wir sehen konnten und auf basis der blichen ungewissheit eines freitags k nnen wir sagen dass wir konkurrenzf hig sind ob wir konkurrenzf hig genug sein werden um unser ziel zu erreichen wird erst mit beginn des morgigen qualifyings enth llt

6806683 theres no doubt that the enthusiasm and grass roots energy we built carries with it its own dangers

6806686 and if they have confidence that im going to make their lives better their childrens lives better i dont think they care whether im green or blue or polka dot
6806687 nobodys going to take the guns of law abiding virginians away from them
6806688 the fact that were tied i think that sends a good signal about what were doing
6806689 such a wonderful car always spurs us to create something really special
6806690 i think it would have been difficult for him with his disease to be in prison he wouldnt have received the treatment he needs and without that he would have been victimized

6806697 sex based pay discrimination means much more than 23 cents on the dollar it can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars over a womans lifetime that are lost to her and her family these lost wages can mean the family is unable to afford college tuition or health insurance and the lowered pensions and social security payments associated with lower income can lead to poverty for elderly women who were not able to save and invest for retirement

6806710 bevor rubens zu uns gekommen ist haben sie mich gefragt wen ich als konkurrenzf hig einsch tze und wer ein guter teamkollege w re dann habe ich ein paar fahrer genannt rubens war einer davon nat rlich interessiert sich das team f r meine meinung denn sie wollen den besten den sie kriegen k nnen das ist ganz nat rlich
6806711 rubens hat einen wirklich guten job gemacht speziell dieses jahr da waren einige fantastische leistungen dabei
6806712 ich denke jeder w re ersch ttert wenn er gehen m sste rubens selbst nat rlich am allermeisten er ist ein toller teamkollege und hoffentlich bleibt er das auch er gibt alles f r die verbesserung des autos und auch ross sagt dass er besser denn je f hrt er macht einen wirklich guten job

6806757 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes

6806762 i want them to make the statement once they all muslim student associations have refused continually over the course of a year to say i condemn hamas as a genocidal terrorist organization or they could simply say i condemn hamas as a terrorist organization in the same way i would like to hear riz khan and other people on this network criticize their network for having a birthday celebration for a monster named samir quntar who murdered a father in front of his four year old and then smashed the childs brains out why is al jazeera supporting this muslim terrorist
6806763 i would like to hear tolerance for other groups concern when there is a concerted effort by your own community to destroy for example the jewish state
6806764 arabs do nothing on impulse muslims have no allegiance to their country their only allegiance is to islam thats what theyve taught since birth thats all they know muslims have no borders now im sure you would you agree with me that that is the international jew the old anti semitic stereotype reworded and turned into the international muslim thats from your own website why would you publish that explain it to me like im a three year old
6806765 these articles that you publish on your website they dont really promote the idea of tolerance
6806766 i think youre wrong ive always promoted tolerance and ecumenicism i invite people to come on to my platforms and debate them and i do show respect for them what i dont have respect for is when there is a concerted effort to destroy the jewish state and to kill the jews
6806767 do you support the creation of a palestinian state in jordan which is 70 palestinian
6806768 jordan is a palestinian state but it doesnt have a palestinian government
6806769 no i just said i want jordan to be a palestinian state
6806770 thats exactly right you dont want a palestinian state in palestine
6806771 i do want a palestinian state in jordan and they can annex the west bank
6806772 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong

6806775 we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
6806776 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle

6806778 from new york to los angeles and seattle and miami central city leadership is focused on improving the attractiveness and quality of their downtown areas as residential communities
6806779 changing demographic conditions as well as the importance of educated human capital for economic expansion has made downtown life a policy issue for governments businesses and nonprofit organizations there is growing acceptance of the view that sustaining economic growth will require attention to the development and redevelopment of downtown areas

6806791 we havent yet got the figures for the number of eastern europeans returning home but i suspect there will have been a big increase
6806792 if we get into a serious recession immigration will become negative as it has before
6806793 i hope that all those people who have been running scare stories about the impact of immigration from eastern europe on jobs and housing will now eat a little humble pie they should acknowledge that immigration flows are very sensitive to the state of the economy

6806833 die strecke gef llt mir sehr gut zum einen mag ich stra enkurse zum anderen alles was neu ist
6806834 es ist sehr gut was hier in der k rze der zeit errichtet wurde ich f hlte mich auf der strecke auf anhieb ausgesprochen wohl es ist komplett anders als monaco aber trotzdem prima
6806835 ich hatte keine technischen probleme mit den zeiten bin ich aber noch nicht zufrieden
6806836 ich erwarte dass das auto hier anders f hrt als in budapest
6806837 das ist in der formel 1 sehr kompliziert ein unterschied von zwei zehntel bar an einem reifen kann ein auto nahezu unfahrbar machen
6806838 ich bin sehr angetan diese strecke ist nicht nur die gegenwart sondern auch die zukunft und es ist toll so die anlage vom americas cup noch mal zu verwenden
6806839 das sollte man aber nicht berbewerten da war ich einer der ganz wenigen der am ende mit neuen reifen unterwegs war
6806840 am nachmittag war es nicht mehr ganz so gut aber wir haben herausgefunden was wir herausfinden wollten ich denke wir werden ganz gut aussehen die strecke macht fast noch mehr spa als gedacht

6806850 certo quando eravamo in c questo torneo ci dava lillusione di giocare per una volta nel grande calcio il moretti ha una sua collocazione nel tempo adesso siamo nelle sfere che contano ed abbiamo altri obiettivi prioritari ai quali pensare per questo il test di stasera va preso per quello che ovvio che in palio non c nulla e sono serate di amicizia che molto bello godersi

6806855 per cui la debolezza economica peggiora lo stress finanziario che a sua volta danneggia ulteriormente le prospettive economiche
6806856 la recente diminuzione dei prezzi delle commodities cosi come la crescente stabilita del dollaro e stata incoraggiante se la situazione non dovesse cambiare questi ultimi sviluppi insieme ad un ritmo di crescita delleconomia che sara probabilmente inferiore al potenziale ancora per un po di tempo permetterebbe allinflazione di tornare su livelli piu moderati tra la fine del 2008 e il 2009

6806868 if you are bored and disgusted by politics and dont bother to vote you are in effect voting for the entrenched establishments of the two major parties who are not dumb and are keenly aware that its in their interests to keep you disgusted and bored and cynical and to give you every possible psychological reason to stay at home on primary day by all means stay home if you want but dont bullshit yourself that youre not voting in reality there is no such thing as not voting you either vote by voting or you vote by staying home and tacitly doubling the value of some diehards vote
6806869 we are particularly concerned that the draft guidelines might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6806870 we understand that you intend to finalize and sign next week the draft attorney general guidelines intended to govern fbi criminal national security and foreign intelligence investigations
6806871 we have a number of questions and concerns about the guidelines and urge you not to sign them until members of congress experts in the relevant fields and affected communities have had a full opportunity to provide detailed input
6806872 to congressional staff for only a few hours at a time over the course of a week and a half during the august recess when many staff and members are out of town
6806873 permit the fbi to use a variety of intrusive investigative techniques to conduct assessments of possible criminal activity national security threats or foreign intelligence collection without any initial factual predication
6806874 we are concerned about the extent to which such authority might for example permit the fbi to conduct long term physical surveillance of an innocent american citizen interview such an individuals neighbors and professional colleagues including based on a pretext or misrepresentation all without any basis for suspicion
6806875 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6806876 no as only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6806877 it was not possible initially to reproduce the capacitive coupling effect in the car as the problem was caused by a sporadic error in the control unit due to the extremely high frequency of the voltage in the steering wheel the safety mechanisms and data recordings did not pick up on the error in the absence of data all the theoretical possibilities had to be systematically investigated and analysed in tests furthermore the capacitive coupling effect only occurs under certain conditions without the option of driving the kers test car used in jerez again we had to reconstruct these conditions we also had to develop a model to be installed between the steering wheel and sidepod which replicated the characteristics of the human body as an electric transfer element
6806878 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6806879 we have already handed over this safety analysis complete with measures and recommendations to the fia and will also make our findings available to the other teams at the next meeting of the technical working group
6806880 it is supposed to be a very highly protected area because of its sensitive nature so i dont know what happened
6806881 external review did not support all the interpretations made in the correspondence
6806882 the decision not to publish in this case was made by the editorial executive committee and a full explanation was given to the authors

6806889 originally if i was going to come back i was going to come back on november 2 im not coming back for financial reasons
6806890 i retired from one day cricket for cricketing reasons and im coming back for cricketing reasons
6806891 i had a meeting with the coach and the captain on wednesday to talk about the winter and where we were going to go to get me right for the test matches
6806892 the one dayers were mentioned south africa was mentioned where i went last year and i said id go away and think about it i was putting the kids to bed yesterday afternoon and the coach rang to say ryan was injured and asked me if i fancied it
6806893 i said id go away and think about it and an hour later i said id come back i had to speak to durham because they were in my mind after being so good to me since i came back from new zealand to where i am now
6806894 that was in the thought process but im just chuffed to bits that they wanted me to come back and im just pleased to be back on the international scene again
6806895 id been told by so many people to try to get steve harmison so i thought id give it a final go
6806896 i met up with steve at the hotel the other day after his game against notts and he was pretty positive about things
6806897 the good thing is that hes helping us out of a situation with ryan being injured yesterday so we rang him up and asked him whether he fancied it
6806898 hes as keen as anything he said before he played that test the other day that it felt like christmas eve so lets hope he delivers the same performance here as he did at the oval
6806899 ich will madrid verlassen und in der premier league spielen chelsea ist eine gro e mannschaft sie haben ein gutes angebot abgegeben sowohl f r mich als auch f r real
6806900 ich habe real viel zu verdanken aber ich will hier raus mein pers nliches ziel ist es der beste spieler der welt zu werden und das ist bei real madrid nicht m glich ich hoffe dass bald alles erledigt ist
6806901 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6806902 as we know in australia new zealand and england their players associations have all indicated they would not like to travel to pakistan
6806903 however the boards have not yet committed themselves and maybe now you are going to see the boards taking a stand either way
6806904 theyve had security briefings from three different companies theyve had the government give an independent security report on whether we should travel or not
6806905 when you take all that into consideration the reason they are not sending a team is for security reasons
6806906 this was our boards decision and our board met today so it doesnt make sense to wait until sunday to make a decision if theyve reached a consensus today
6806907 i just feel sometimes we could have made these decisions earlier on rather than wait until the last minute because if the tournament needed to be rescheduled it could be done easier
6806908 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6806909 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pakistan cricket board the pakistan authorities and the security consultants
6806910 the players are naturally disappointed for their fans and the people of pakistan that they will not have a chance to see them in action in that country in september
6806911 they csa should have waited until sunday when a final decision on the future of the tournament was to be announced
6806912 it will badly hurt the possibilities of the tournament going ahead now
6806913 i think it all depends on pakistan and what they have to say on the security issue
6806914 if pakistan says the country is safe to play in and the tournament can be held on schedule they have our support
6806915 i cant say what the bcci stance would be should the tournament be cancelled or moved from pakistan
6806916 in any case it is not possible for us to play in another series in pakistan because india has a full series in pakistan later in the year

6806923 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6806924 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6806925 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6806926 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6806927 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6806928 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6806929 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6806930 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6806931 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6806932 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6806942 among the thousands of palestinians arrested after 27 february 2002 some hundreds were transferred to full scale interrogation by the gss israel security agency in centers amnesty international has received reports that some of the detainees interrogated by the gss were subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation shabeh prolonged standing or sitting in a painful position and being violently shaken

6806946 the new traffic law is an example of the rise of extortion in egypt w ith some effort and sensitivity the authorities could have presented legislation that improves the situation on the roads instead of one which seeks to extort money and spread corruption
6806947 the fines are now so high it will no longer be enough to pay off a traffic policeman with e 5 or e 10 1 90 1 30 1

6806954 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6806955 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6806956 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6806957 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6806958 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6806959 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6806960 all of his sentences contain a noun a verb and 9 11
6806961 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good

6806983 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6806984 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6806985 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6806986 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6806987 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6806988 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6806989 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6806990 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6806991 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6806992 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6806993 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6806994 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6806995 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6806996 who are open to doing something on the production side
6806997 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6806998 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6806999 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

6807002 ich habe bereits in gladbach gesp rt dass mich die leute euphorischer empfangen das hat sicher auch was mit der wm 2006 zu tun
6807003 es gibt hier alle voraussetzungen f r eine erfolgreiche zukunft
6807004 ich wei dass ich von der fitness und vom k rpergef hl her noch l nger spielen k nnte aber ob ich nach der saison noch lust habe das werde ich mal sehen und nach dem ende der saison entscheiden
6807005 nur so viel es gibt unter den kandidaten jemanden bei dem ich denken w rde der hat das zeug dazu
6807006 ich habe respekt vor ihm weil er in seiner karriere nicht den einfachsten weg gegangen ist das bef higt ihn resistent gegen ber kleinen negativerlebnissen zu sein
6807007 im not so bad after all just look at what these guys believe and in whom they believe
6807008 in 2007 clark went from an assignment in alaska to the deserts of iraq from familiar shipmates to the military branch perhaps least like his own the army but not only did clark survive his hitch as a sand coastie he thrived by the time he left iraq for his current job as an inspector with coast guard sector charleston s c clark was the most sought after expert in iraq on hazardous materials his commander said
6807009 you had people here who didnt want to leave but after a few days of being stranded they were saying ok its time to go
6807010 is repeated time and time again does it mean that by u
6807011 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6807012 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6807013 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6807014 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6807015 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6807016 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6807017 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6807018 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6807019 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6807020 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6807021 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6807022 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6807023 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6807024 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6807025 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6807026 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6807027 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6807028 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6807029 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6807030 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6807031 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6807032 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6807033 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6807034 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6807035 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6807036 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6807037 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6807038 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6807039 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6807040 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6807041 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6807042 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6807043 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6807044 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6807045 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6807046 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6807047 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6807048 we consider this an extremely important non violent action taken by tibetans under the leadership of the dalai lama in a very critical period for tibet particularly the post olympic period
6807049 it will be one of the most important non violent campaigns to get support from the world community for world peace and fight against oppression in the world in general and particularly in tibet
6807050 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6807051 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6807052 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6807053 and the democrats smell blood in the water and theyre using the quote to paint mccain as out of touch
6807054 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6807055 seven houses and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6807056 housing advantage could complicate attempts to cast obama who owns one million dollar home in chicago himself as an out of touch arugula eating elitist
6807057 this is one of those metaphorical moments in the campaign remember back in 1992 when it seemed like president bush didnt know what a supermarket scanner was they said that was metaphoric for him being out of touch the mccain team says no way the john mccain brand is too well established no one will see him as an elitist
6807058 launched a national tv ad and a series of campaign stops aimed at portraying mccain as wealthy and out of touch
6807059 does a guy who made more than 4million last year
6807060 provoked a furious response by mccain campaign and republican national committee aides who charged hypocrisy and argued that the senator from illinois had received help purchasing his south side chicago mansion from
6807061 the mccain campaign is not disclosing how much money it is planning to put behind its rezko ad but vows that it will air on broadcast television in key states
6807062 owns at least eight properties not the seven democrats are alleging or the four mccains staff identified according to a politico analysis of property and tax records as well as interviews
6807063 may have some wiggle room in explaining why he couldnt immediately provide an answer when asked by politico how many houses he and his wife cindy own sen mccain himself does not own any of the properties theyre all owned by cindy mccain her dependent children and the trusts and companies they control
6807064 seemed to relish the frustrations of scores of reporters following him this week in anticipation of the announcement
6807065 even after they met thursday according to two people close to the governor
6807066 said it was her impression that the vice presidential nomination wasnt discussed their session wasnt any more meaningful than the 10 to 15 minutes they have spent together before other joint appearances skinner said in a telephone interview
6807067 call it the biden buzz part of the noise comes from the reporters swarming around sen joe biden yet all the speculation about the delaware lawmaker as a leading candidate for vice presidential running mate may be saying a lot about what barack obamas campaign lacks
6807068 staff in chicago and party activists see biden as addressing two of obamas biggest weaknesses his lack of experience especially on world affairs and his reluctance to attack his opponent
6807069 relationship to a founder of the 1960s radical group weather underground
6807070 focuses on william ayers whose weatherman organization took credit for a series of bombings including nonfatal explosions at the pentagon and u s capitol four decades ago
6807071 were not announcing exactly what the plan is i think its safe to assume there will be more ads
6807072 said obama has been surrounding himself with people who hate america
6807073 is active in an iowa group opposed to abortion rights he is also a leader of iowans for tax relief which lobbies in des moines and has a political action committee involved in iowa state campaigns failor donated 1 250 to mccain last year and was paid at least 50 000 by mccain in the months leading up to the iowa caucuses
6807074 threatening letter containing an unidentified white powder was sent to
6807075 at least 19 people were examined at hospitals or were quarantined outside the colorado office while authorities tried to determine whether the powder was hazardous
6807076 announced that the powder was phony and that the writer appeared to be marc harold ramsey the 39 year old has been in jail since last september unable to post the 350 000 bond on charges of felony charges of menacing harassment and assault on a peace officer according to the arapahoe county sheriffs office he is a prolific writer of threatening letters said u s secret service agent malcolm wiley
6807077 youll be paying ballpark prices to eat ballpark food and ballpark prices to drink bottled water during the potentially sunbaked stretch between the time the gates open at 1 p m and when obama takes the stage seven hours later
6807078 said the food prices thursday night would be consistent with those charged at broncos games but could not give specifics
6807079 few years ago executives at the prestigious university of chicago medical center were concerned that an increasing number of patients were arriving at their emergency room with what the executives considered to be non urgent complaints the visits were costly to the hospital and many of the patients coming from the surrounding south side neighborhood were poor and uninsured
6807080 an executive at the medical center launched an innovative program to steer the patients to existing neighborhood clinics to deal with their health needs
6807081 and others in late 2006 recommended that the hospital hire the firm of david axelrod who a few months later became the chief strategist for barack obamas presidential campaign
6807082 provides a window into the close relationship between the obamas their associates at the university of chicago and axelrod the strategist most central to barack obamas rise
6807083 is especially aided by a 39 point bulge among voters in wayne county including detroit
6807084 iraqi officials who have pushed for an even tighter target date for the united states to end its military operations could also end up rejecting the draft agreement
6807085 approved in its current form the accord seems likely to take center stage in the presidential race
6807086 calls for us troops to pull out of iraqi cities and villages and withdraw to their bases by june 30 said iraqi government spokesman ali al dabbagh and ali adeeb a close aide to prime minister nouri al maliki
6807087 under the draft agreement a us troop withdrawal from iraqi cities could be as early as june conditions permitting
6807088 private us contractors would be subject to iraqi law unlike at present but the american side held firm in its insistence that us troops would remain subject exclusively to us legal jurisdiction officials said
6807089 legislators party leaders and government officials can now try to make their own revisions
6807090 originally planned to stay in baghdad just four hours but lengthened her meetings with mr maliki and others as they wrestled with the sensitive issues of whether us personnel will be immune from iraqi legal action and when us forces will begin a significant withdrawal from the country
6807091 there is no final agreement but we are very close everything has been addressed tomorrow is a very important day
6807092 appeared headed for a diplomatic showdown as prospects for united nations action on the georgia conflict dimmed under a cloud of veto threats
6807093 if russias invasion of georgia ushers in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west washington fears that a newly emboldened but estranged moscow could use its influence money energy resources united nations security council veto and yes its arms industry to undermine american interests around the world
6807094 while russias action has been termed a new cold war that concept doesnt capture the dramatic global changes since mikhail gorbachev disbanded the soviet union in 1991 say diplomats and russian area specialists in a more globalized world russia is at once a competitor a partner and an opponent
6807095 russian forces lingered deep in georgia on thursday digging trenches and setting up mortars a day before kremlin officials promised to complete a troop withdrawal from this former soviet republic
6807096 a top russian general said it could be 10 days before the bulk of the troops left and the mixed signals from moscow left georgians guessing about its intentions nearly a week after a cease fire deal
6807097 about whether it would withdraw its troops from georgia by its self imposed deadline of friday while georgias president said he saw very little if any movement of russian troops from occupied areas
6807098 faced dismemberment thursday as moscow backed separatists hardened independence demands and russia retained an iron grip on the eve of a promised troop withdrawal
6807099 its clear that tempers are rising and nerves are fraying in gori
6807100 a small group of fellow georgians will confront the russian army today about 30 miles west of the nations capital as they have each day since tuesday
6807101 planned to yell at the soldiers demand they go home and sing georgias national anthem
6807102 as moscow moves closer to recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia
6807103 it looks increasingly as though georgias internal refugees may never go home georgias government says this is a creeping ethnic cleansing sponsored by russia
6807104 the kremlins tight grip on the media in recent years has been readily evident during the conflict in georgia right down to the way the television news has presented the georgian leaders speeches
6807105 for all the governments success at managing the news in russia it has seemed ill prepared to press its case internationally
6807106 failed to grasp that the same figure it was mocking on its channels president mikheil saakashvili of georgia was using his fluency in english to dominate coverage in the rest of the world
6807107 investors pulled their money out of russia in the wake of the georgia conflict at the fastest rate since the 1998 rouble crisis
6807108 russian debt and equity markets have also suffered sharp falls since the conflict began on august 8
6807109 the bush administration on thursday proposed stronger job protections for doctors and other health care workers who refuse to participate in abortions because of religious or moral objections
6807110 would require as many as 584 000 employers ranging from major hospitals to doctors offices and nursing homes to certify in writing that they are complying with several federal laws that protect the conscience rights of health care workers
6807111 could go into effect after a 30 day comment period
6807112 was welcomed by conservative groups abortion opponents and others as necessary to safeguard workers from being fired disciplined or penalized in other ways
6807113 does not include a controversial proposal that critics said would define some forms of birth control as abortions
6807114 says costs 7 billion to 10 billion in lost productivity every year

6807117 oil futures charged up 5 62 or 4 9 to 121 18 a barrel in new york thursday marking their first close above 120 since aug 7 and completing three straight days of gains the longest such streak since mid july
6807118 weakening dollar as well as worsening relations between the us and russia the worlds no 2 oil exporter were cited as factors behind the gains
6807119 the growing number of americans who are declaring bankruptcy to get out from under their debt in july alone there were 96 000 new bankruptcy filings

6807124 we respect the california commission and the job they do we always enjoy working with them and work very well together the illegal use of steroids is a problem in all major sports including mixed martial arts we certainly do not condone the use of steroids
6807125 but we also support trust and have confidence in our fighter antonio silva who has denied ever taken any illegal substance including steroids and is prepared to challenge the results of the california commission
6807126 so until all the facts are known and a final decision is rendered elitexc will reserve making any further comments at this time

6807133 it is a very popular name though and one that i wouldnt use for a child of my own only because i see so many little ellas and bellas being named every day
6807134 dogs before were used for work on the farm and different occupations people would keep them outside in a dog house

6807141 many of the problems we have seen involving mortgage brokers in california are not because there has been a failure in law rather its a failure of enforcement
6807142 californias real estate law is one of the toughest in the nation sb 1240 will transform our regulator from one that relies on consumer complaints to identify fraud to one that is a proactive protector of borrowers rights

6807144 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6807145 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6807146 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6807147 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field

6807174 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6807175 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

6807196 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
6807197 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
6807198 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

6807220 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6807221 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6807222 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6807223 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6807224 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6807225 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

6807232 given how hard adults find it to cope with a series like big brother to put children in that environment is asking for trouble theres a danger this could leave children traumatised
6807233 the parents thought it was an incredibly positive experience for their kids to go through we were taking them away for two weeks so they were highly monitored
6807234 we wanted to see what happens if the parents were not there
6807235 you are just left with this positive feeling that these kids are wonderful weve got this generation here of brilliant kids if theyre let loose theyre brilliant
6807236 the safety of the kids was absolutely paramount there were security guards chaperones production staff and cctv for the parents
6807237 if its intended to be educational then its a good thing but i dont think it will be
6807238 im sure the programme will serve no useful purpose and will simply be voyeuristic and low grade entertainment
6807239 when big brother first came on the scene we were told it was an observational documentary and we would obtain psychological data that it would be a step forward in finding out about relationships
6807240 one needs to work towards attaining the objectives of his life in all conditions if one only strives hard when the circumstances are suitable then this is a reflection that he is not really striving to achieve his target
6807241 todays data increases the chance of a recession in the uk so thats why sterling is under considerable pressure and thats why we think sterling will remain under pressure
6807242 we share the same values about liberty about democracy about the need for social cohesion and for people to work together co operatively
6807243 think anybody knows actually what britishness is including the people who want to tell us what they think britishness is

6807246 i dont mind hard work especially digging line it passes the time and youre doing something
6807247 it doesnt hit you right away that youre off prison ground until youre sitting there at night and you see the stars above you
6807248 it was a shock just leaving the prison uncuffed after being transported from regional to regional shackled and cuffed you know it was kind of a different feeling
6807249 i get a lot of peace and freedom out in the wilderness its nice its just nice to be away from it all theres a lot of negativity when youre in prison and when youre out there youre away from all that so its a big freedom out there
6807250 when i first got here i could give a shit about getting out
6807251 i will complete all assignments pledging to do my best from time of departure until the time of return to the institution and will perform in a manner to bring credit to the program and myself i understand that there is a zero tolerance for any substance abuse any usage of drugs alcohol or tobacco will result in my removal from the program i pledge that i will not have any one on one conversations or contact with any female on any fire or project
6807252 i have my own line i work pretty friendly with the inmates i know the inmates pretty well but they know they have this line and if they cross it theres no going back
6807253 the deer lodge crew is a benefit because its overall cost is less than federal crews
6807254 this crew can very often get to a fire while its still in the initial attack phase and thus have the opportunity to keep it a smaller and less expensive fire in many instances i think the crew is more productive than others
6807255 while some crews will lose their focus and commitment during the later stages of a fire sometimes even requesting release to their home unit the deer lodge crew is more than happy to stay throughout the tedious mop up stages of a fire they continue to work hard dont complain about adverse conditions and remain productive because they are in no hurry to go home and want to do well so they get ordered again for the next fire
6807256 those guys will bend backwards before screwing up ive never had a problem with them

6807293 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6807294 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
6807295 has been conditioned on our expectation that the prices of oil and other commodities would ultimately stabilize in part as the result of slowing global growth
6807296 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6807297 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
6807298 a statutory resolution regime for nonbanks besides reducing uncertainty would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails
6807299 a more fully integrated overview of the entire financial system
6807300 i think that offer has nothing to do with the case itself
6807301 at this point now were preparing for trial we have rejected the offer now
6807302 a confusing tangle consisting of local and regional crises large and small are heating up across the muslim world from algeria to pakistan
6807303 hes been doing jogging all week only jogging nothing serious were quite pleased with that
6807304 the government left us here and hasnt brought us any food
6807305 they tried to steal a local priests car when we were in gori
6807306 this is really good for your book this is confirmation of every argument you make this means you have a real chance of being published
6807307 what can we do with this can this help us
6807308 the knives and the heat and padma shes so out of control have you read her cookbook its ridiculous like this fake nigella lawson supermodel vibe
6807309 i love to go and pamper myself silly and eat so much korean barbecue
6807310 when you listen to the child ballads its some crazy old man in scotland and you know hes not smiling because the songs are all so horrible theyre so vicious and pagan even the ones that arent pagan im way more interested in these heavily stylized things like english countertenor alfred deller singing elizabethan minstrel songs its like butoh but way more text appropriate
6807311 im like i cant believe youre singing this like its nothing this is infanticide theres this texture of chilled out ness in folk music so i was trying to do a piece to insist on how nasty it is i want to own the murder jerry garcia made a recording of it its so dopey it plods along i mean they push her in and make a fiddle
6807312 someone took a girls body and made a violin like thats amazing it requires some focus were going to have bone were going to have flesh were going to have hair making that cut was the most fun thing ever it was crazy to do and it felt so delicious
6807313 when you think about classical composers you think about the composer being isolated
6807314 but with nico theres a social element thats really important
6807315 there was no score until the piece was done and its very harmonically complex i would mess something up and he clearly was so open to the moment that he would keep my accident laden version
6807316 you can get away with a breadth of influence there
6807317 people here there is no end to asking how do you reconcile this plus this its really boring people asking how do you bridge the two different worlds what worlds are you talking about
6807318 hides the source of the identity and so heightens emotion and undercuts rationality
6807319 im sure all their weapons were plastic and can be found at your local toys r us
6807320 online learning through virtual schools is one of the most important advancements in attempting to rethink the effectiveness of education in the united states the virtual school provides access to online collaborative and self paced learning environments settings that can facilitate 21st century skills todays students must be able to combine these skills with the effective use of technology to succeed in current and future jobs
6807321 i highly respect the club the players and especially the fans whove always treated me well but thats not my objective
6807322 i have an offer from chelsea which is good for me and the club i dream of playing in the english league
6807323 chelsea have a great squad and a great team my objective is to play there ive got nothing against real madrid but i hope to resolve this situation as soon as possible
6807324 its not about money i simply want to leave i want to be the best player in the world and that isnt possible at real madrid
6807325 ive come to an end of a cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid ive given my all ive scored goals ive won two leagues and thats not easy
6807326 there is no way we will be able to survive at our current level if it continues like this
6807327 it will be impossible to have any improvement this season if we do not improve the numbers greatly
6807328 we cannot sustain what we did last season finishing fifth and having a good european run we could not really sustain it when we were short of players from january onwards last season
6807329 now we are more players short than then so if we are in a worse position there is no way we can achieve again what we did last season
6807330 this is probably the toughest period i have had as everton manager mainly because a lot of my concentration at the moment is not with the players i have here but with trying to bring new players in
6807331 there is no doubt that a lot of our energy is being spent on players we want to sign and that is not helpful for the team
6807332 ashley is now worth three times what we paid for him i am inclined to exaggerate but he is priceless he is absolutely outstanding
6807333 actually i had better not shout out how much i think he is worth because we are in the throes of doing a new contract with him
6807334 i actually think he is worth 4million his value has plummeted until we have got the contract sorted
6807335 as a blackburn fan it would be a tragedy if they left
6807336 roque is a tremendous player as is benni and were a club thats trying to achieve things ourselves
6807337 you could bid 30million for roque and im sure they still wouldnt let him go in my opinion
6807338 you couldnt let brad friedel david bentley and santa cruz go in the same season
6807339 i am being made to look as if i broke a promise
6807340 hamburg have been in the bundesliga for nearly 50 years and played bayern nearly 100 times and they will play bayern another 100 times but for belgium it was the first time ever at the olympic games
6807341 but nobody seems to have any understanding for me when i consider whether or not it would interest me to play in the quarter finals with belgium i am being punished for trying to find a compromise
6807342 i think the smarter marketers and advertisers would find a way to make better use of their budgets i tend to view the economy as an opportunity and a challenge at the end of the day people still need to sell and buy stuff
6807343 a convenience store is a convenient target for the bad guys
6807344 theres cash handy its open late its easy to get in and out so we have to make it difficult
6807345 the ultimate goal of this ordinance is to make the convenience stores safe for the employees that work there and safe for the communities that shop there
6807346 everybody thinks outside this country that america is a very rich place
6807347 my one cousin came here very new from pakistan and one day i brought him here
6807348 you feel secure behind the glass but then you wonder why do you need all this
6807349 its the land of opportunity and the first thing you have to be in a cage
6807350 if the robber kills this one guy then its like killing the whole family
6807351 the lad has got two tremendous clubs to pick from then if his dad is right
6807352 we are looking for three more players to come in before the deadline but they have got to be the right players
6807353 we need definitely one more defender theres no doubt about that
6807354 we are looking for a defender a midfielder and possibly one more forward
6807355 i can surprise you sometimes as i got one who you did not expect and there still might be one more player coming in
6807356 you know the position but i cannot tell you much more than that there is always interest in barry i cannot tell you much more hes one of the players we follow
6807357 i find barry a good player the problem with players who are 27 or 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
6807358 we are not in a desperate situation because we have alex song back from the olympics abou diaby does not look too far away and hopefully we can have good news from tomas rosicky in the next two weeks
6807359 from a footballing point of view he possesses many of the attributes i like in a player
6807360 he has got great technical ability and weight of pass has an excellent work rate and an eye for a goal
6807361 borja can link up the play from back to front and he will enhance the excellent midfield options we already possess

6807397 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market
6807398 during the fall of 2007 many americans faced a hazard in their products that had been banned for 30 years lead as millions of childrens toys coated with lead paint were recalled it became clear that government oversight had failed and that the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
6807399 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing
6807400 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too
6807401 although there is a small minority of parents who object to the vaccine because of their beliefs about sexuality and the fact that it prevents a sexually transmitted infection to most parents the mode of transmission is not whats important
6807402 the families who are struggling with what to do about this vaccine are focused on issues like safety
6807403 they want us to have more experience with it and have it used by more people
6807404 we tend to overrate the power of conservative forces in our society on the everyday lives of people for example roman catholics use contraception and have abortions at about the same rates as other women in this country

6807426 the opportunity to improve pricing is the low hanging fruit that can help mortgage lenders deliver improved results quickly
6807427 the mortgage industry is undergoing a period of transition that is going to require lenders to challenge past practices and identify new opportunities pricing optimization can help mortgage lenders quantify how prices impact customers enabling them to increase both profits and market share

6807433 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6807434 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
6807435 has been conditioned on our expectation that the prices of oil and other commodities would ultimately stabilize in part as the result of slowing global growth
6807436 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6807437 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
6807438 a statutory resolution regime for nonbanks besides reducing uncertainty would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails

6807461 the inaugural mayors cup challenge match was a resounding success regardless of the final score of the match we had a fabulous experience in our sister city of dundee and a very successful trip on behalf of both alexandrias rugby team and its business community we feel that remploy frontlines support of alexandria rugby and the twinned cities programme will prove to be just as beneficial to our hometown as it is for dundee we look forward to building on what weve started over the years to come
6807462 remploy frontline is very proud to have been a part of this unique twinned city event we hope that our involvement in this programme encourages more businesses and organisations in both cities to look more closely at ways they can support the business and cultural exchanges based on remploy frontlines mission it would be great if alexandria and dundee can create more opportunities for otherwise disabled people and help further enrich their lives

6807474 two major factors were apparent to us when chris and the journeymaker 5 team approached us for support
6807475 first remploy frontline develops and manufactures world class flotation jackets ideally suited for champions like the journeymaker 5 and the waters in which they were racing second chris and his team are helping the uks many disabled children through enriching life experiences one of remploys precepts for helping disabled adults via employment opportunities
6807476 we were confident in our skills as experienced sailors and competitors but we knew we would need some excellent kit on board to help give us a leading edge

6807498 according to the classical model there ought not to be these differences
6807499 according to this both brown dwarfs and stars ought to emerge from interstellar clouds of gas which become concentrated because of the attraction of their mass but if this was the case these celestial bodies should behave in similar ways
6807500 for this we analysed the masses of newly born stars

6807508 this convention our largest ever demonstrated that young people care passionately about and propose solutions to the issues that ultimately affect us all education fair pay and climate change
6807509 we call on the government to introduce legislation to reduce the voting age to 16 and allow thousands more young people who want to exercise a right to vote to do so
6807510 the convention delegates were enthusiastic passionate and inspiring and the decision by the council to prioritise votes at 16 is a major boost to the campaign and to the coalition of other key organisations and political parties who already support it
6807511 the british youth council is an organisation led and run by young people elected to a board of trustees we support young people to have a voice and be heard
6807512 i believe the votes at 16 campaign is what byc is fundamentally about as were a youth organisation committed to giving more young people a voice
6807513 i recently spent three hours on the streets of london talking to the public about this issue and i collected 90 postcards to send to gordon brown calling for a reduction in the voting age so im personally aware of growing support for votes at 16 amongst the general public
6807514 whilst the deadline has passed for miners to lodge claims there are still many claims awaiting settlement some of which may take up to two years before a successful conclusion is reached therefore the site is still critical for solicitors to continue to track the progress of any outstanding claims it is now updated by capita who administer the services for berr providing information such as requests for more health information for each miner progress on claims and the details of the claims settlements
6807515 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget
6807516 working with the top banks and finance companies around the world we have discovered that the pricing process is one of the most undervalued processes in the industry and better understanding customer response presents significant opportunity for profit and volume improvement in the order of 10 20 especially in todays funding constrained environment having the right pricing strategy to generate retail funding and then leverage that funding across mortgage acquisition and retention is critical to sound balance sheet and income management
6807517 to really benefit from price optimisation mortgage lenders need to pay particular attention to how their customers respond to current pricing practices to make more informed product pricing decisions the first step towards a more insight driven retention strategy is to understand at a detailed level the types of customer segments within your current portfolio and how they are likely to react when their rate resets customer segmentation needs to be continually updated to ensure that it is consistent with the most recent market conditions
6807518 the next few years are going to be critical ones for british mortgage lenders in terms of profitability there is going to be continued focus on retention of good customers the need to manage impairment risk tightly meanwhile customers will continue to be shopping for the best rates in a difficult mortgage market the mortgage lenders who will thrive in this environment will be those who understand how their different customers will respond to their offers and how to use that information to determine the best action and offer for each customer segment
6807519 empirical surveys on the international egrc market are rare so this report is welcome and timely the market knows the quality of gartners work across different technology sectors and the magic quadrant has become a de facto guide as to where individual vendors stand naturally therefore we are delighted that we have come out as the only european headquartered challenger to the current international status quo we are confident with the recent rapid growth of sword achievers representation across the globe that our position will improve further by the time the next review of the market is conducted

6807603 pour la russie il est actuellement tr s avantageux de reconna tre ces r publiques il sagirait certainement de la plus grande victoire du pays en politique trang re ces derni res ann es mais il ne faut pas oublier que cette reconnaissance frapperait s v rement les int r ts commerciaux de notre lite politique en occident ces gens se prononcent activement contre la reconnaissance cest pourquoi elle prendra s rement plusieurs ann es
6807604 si loccident continue soutenir mikha l saakachvili ce qui sest pass en oss tie du sud se r p tera probablement dans ce cas la pr paration dune nouvelle agression nous placera devant la n cessit daccorder une aide et de d fendre la reconnaissance de lind pendance nous permettra dy introduire nos forces

6807606 its valid it was unfair because it was a production sharing contract we have negotiated with them for a year it was turned from a sharing contract into a service contract
6807607 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
6807608 but i think that some of the companies are open to continued discussions even on relationship grounds and some of the companies dont think its worth their time

6807621 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think
6807622 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6807623 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6807624 now its up to the icc to take a decision which they would take on sunday but i would say that south africas refusal will badly hurt the event we will still do our best to save the event and host it on schedule
6807625 we made the best security arrangements for south africa when they toured us last year and it was only at the end that they did not want to play in karachi so we relocated the match to multan
6807626 the icc has noted csas decision and will not make any further comment until the icc board meeting on sunday
6807627 hemos empezado el partido muy tarde no hemos estado a nuestro nivel ni a la altura del partido siempre hemos ido a remolque y no podemos hacer una valoraci n positiva del partido en ninguna faceta del juego
6807628 queda el partido del domingo y hay que luchar a muerte porque lo que hay en juego es una medalla
6807629 lo m s escandaloso es que no es la primera vez que el gobierno demuestra ser completamente incapaz de proteger la integridad de informaci n altamente sensible lo que le incapacita para encomendarle la protecci n de nuestra seguridad

6807654 no s por qu es tan irregular este equipo nos ha faltado la contundencia que tuvimos contra corea
6807655 ellos han jugado demasiado libre ahora hay que intentar superarlo para la final
6807656 hemos vuelto a estar mal en defensa y lo del otro d a fue un espejismo la victoria contra corea del sur en cuartos de final con 35 goles en contra es imposible pasar a una final si queremos ganar el bronce no podemos estar como hoy
6807657 el d a que estamos bien nos venimos arriba y el d a que estamos mal vamos para abajo en picado no sabemos poner freno a las situaciones y no podemos recibir 36 goles
6807658 cuando hemos ido mas al contacto no nos han dejado los rbitros algo que es incomprensible viendo c mo estaban jugando ellos
6807659 han jugado a su manera r pido al contraataque bien y duro en defensa y han tenido al rubio este que ha empezado a enchufar que creo que ha hecho el mejor partido de su vida
6807660 hemos estado todo el partido a remolque aunque la diferencia era poca ellos estaban llevando el partido y no hemos dado la sensaci n de poder engancharlo

6807679 the trend in naming pets is going toward more human names
6807680 they can really pick up on them it gets too complicated with more than that but give a name with a punch to it
6807681 any pet as soon as they can id their name that is the first step in training
6807682 she is a husky i wanted something to do with nature but as she was a member of my family too i just wanted her to have a name that a person could have too
6807683 ella is a name i have always liked and in my job as a name expert compiling data and giving advice about baby names to people all the time it is one that i had seen that i really liked
6807684 it is a very popular name though and one that i wouldnt use for a child of my own only because i see so many little ellas and bellas being named every day
6807685 dogs before were used for work on the farm and different occupations people would keep them outside in a dog house
6807686 nowadays they are in the house even sleeping in the bed sometimes
6807687 also think about that you will be calling it this all the time so you dont want it to be some long crazy name
6807688 i just got a new rabbit what should i call him
6807689 managing an endangered species and seeing it recover its so rare that were able to do that
6807690 by the time somethings listed as endangered theyre in such dire straits its so hard to bring them back at that point getting to that point unfortunately is a death sentence for many species
6807691 our goal is not to have them downlisted to threatened
6807692 its to have them off the list and in addition to having them delisted altogether its to repopulate their historic range
6807693 non voleva cedere al flusso di ricordi ed emozioni forse provava un senso di lealt verso la propria storia una cosa accennare a unesperienza usarla come riferimento e analogia ma descrivere il fatto orrendo nei dettagli a estranei che annuiranno e dimenticheranno doveva sembrargli un tradimento del proprio dolore

6807710 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them
6807711 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6807712 i dont think that area would have been calmed without those guys
6807713 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
6807714 they committed crimes and attacked the iraqi army and the american army and there is no way to rehabilitate them
6807715 we dont want this to be a dead end kick them to the curb kind of thing
6807716 our men worked hard and deserve appreciation and not punishment from the government
6807717 america is the only one asking us not to fight the maliki government

6807798 bayangkanlah kalau kau jatuh cinta pada seorang pria kenapa kau merasa gelisah sekali dengan mencintai seorang wanita apakah ia wanita yang nggak beres
6807799 oh tidak dia wanita baik baik baiiik sekali dia menjalankan agamanya dengan sepenuh hati dia cukup membatasi pergaulannya dengan setiap lelaki yah itulah yang mungkin menjadi masalah padaku coba kalau dia itu wanita yang nggak beres tentu masalahnya tak serumit ini
6807800 kau bodoh seharusnya kau bahagia mencintai wanita seperti itu coba bayangkan kalau kau mencintai wanita slebor hatimu akan terus sibuk memikirkan setiap tingkah lakunya kau akan merasakan cemburu sakit hati membenci dendam bisa bisa kau gila pikiranmu akan terus tersita dengan wanita seperti itu kapan lagi kau mau ingat allah bukankah mencintai wanita yang sholeh membuatmu sadar untuk bertindak seperti orang yang kau cintai
6807801 benar pak lalu apakah aku boleh berpacaran dengannya aku merasa tidak puas hanya dengan berteman dengannya perlu pak kiai ketahui bahwa banyak orang mengatakan bahwa pacaran itu haram karena dengan pacaran hati kita akan sibuk mengingat kekasih kita sehingga kita lalai dari mengingat allah bagaimana pula kalau dengan pacaran malah membuat kita semakin ingat dengan allah
6807802 maaf nak aku sudah tua banyak sekali hal hal yang sudah aku lupakan tolong kau jelaskan kepadaku apa yang kau maksud dengan pacaran setahuku kata itu belum pernah aku jumpai di kitab fikih manapun sehingga dapat ditentukan halal haramnya sudah kuingat ingat pula segala ilmu tasawuf juga kata itu tak kutemukan di sana berikanlah gambaran kepadaku tentang pacaran agar aku dapat menentukan hukumnya
6807803 banyak pak ada yang ngobrol ngobrol kadang tak tentu arah sering sering menelpon pacarnya ada yang suka pergi berdua duaan dan yah begitulah pak kiai saya kira juga tahu tapi tunggu dulu pak kiai yang akan kulakukan bukan seperti itu aku akan membicarakan dengannya masalah agama saling menjaga diri dengan saling mengingatkan bila berbuat khilaf pokoknya yang islami lah pak
6807804 ooh begitu lalu apa bedanya dengan berteman kau kira kau tidak punya kewajiban seperti itu terhadap seorang teman kau kira kepada teman kau boleh berlaku tak islami coba aku tanyakan kepadamu apakah kekuatan perjanjian itu sehingga tak dapat memisahkan pemilikan satu dengan lainnya apakah kau mengatasnamakan allah dalam perjanjian tadi mengapa tak sekalian nikah saja khan dengan nikah kau bahkan lebih leluasa lagi tak seorang laki laki pun berhak memiliki seorang wanita tanpa melalui nikah bahkan ayahnya sendiri yang membesarkan dan memberi makan serta pendidikan kepadanya sampai sampai si ayah pun tak berhak memaksa anak wanitanya menikahi pria yang bukan pilihan sang anak itulah yang islami
6807805 lalu apa yang sudah kau berikan padanya sampai sampai kau ingin memilikinya lebih baik kau tunjukkan rasa cintamu dengan tanggung jawab sebagai seorang sahabat yang islami biarkan cinta bersemi dalam hatimu karena itu anugerah allah yang harus kau syukuri bukan ingkari cinta itu amanat allah maka jangan kau khianati pacaran yang kau maksud sebenarnya hanya kata tanpa makna yang akan menjerumuskan orang pada penghalalan zina dalam dirinya kau mungkin sakit hati mendengar perkataanku ini tapi apa artinya menyenangkan hatimu kalau yang kusampaikan itu akan menjerumuskanmu dan membuatmu menyesal kelak
6807806 sudahlah kalau kau ingin pacaran juga silakan saja aku tak berhak memaksa aku hanya ingin kau berpikiran dewasa dan tidak menghabiskan waktumu untuk sesuatu yang kau sendiri tak tahu manfaatnya

6807854 i knew you were anyway but ive just been watching the footage from the gig and i had to tell you that you are just one fucking amazing drummer not only the execution but the attention to detail is absolutely blinding
6807855 liam has been helping out as our drummer has gone on holiday i can honestly say he is a fantastic funny and enjoyable person to work with he is also a fine drummist and we wouldnt hesitate to employ his services in the future anyone who can pull the gigs off with no rehearsal and play to such a high standard as liam did deserves recognition well done mate

6807863 everyday there should be new vision new revelation new understanding new passion new purpose
6807864 i am truly sorry about all your troubles but i know that god is working on your behalf remember that god loves you and therefore he does not spare you he lays on you the cross of jesus christ whatever revelations you receive or whatever emotional experiences you have are worthless unless they lead you to the very real and constant practice of dying to your self nature unfortunately you cannot die without suffering nor can you be said to be fully dead while part of you still lives the death that god brings you will pierce deep within soul and spirit will be divided he sees in you all that you cannot see he knows exactly where the fatal blows should fall he heads straight for that which you are most reluctant to give up pain is only felt where there is life and in this situation life is precisly the place where death is needed your father wastes no time by cutting into that which is already dead if he wanted to let you remain as you are he would certainly do so h e can only accomplish this by cutting into that which is alive do not expect him to attack only those obviouslly wicked desires which you renounced forever when you gave yourself to him rather he may test you by taking away the wonderful sense of freedom you feel or by taking from you all that now brings you spiritual comfort will you resist no allow everything volunteer for your own death for god will only accomplish his work to the extent that you let him do not push away the progress that god wants to make in your life c heerfully give up everything you now rely on to gods good pleasure give up spiritual things too whenever he wants to take them from you are you afraid that he may not be able to give you his strength when he takes away yours why does he take it away only so that he might be your supply the lesson may be painful but he wishes to purify you i see that every natural means of help is shut off god intends to accomplish his work in you by cutting off every human resource he is a jealous god he wants you to see that what he is going to do within you can only be done by himself alone surrender to his plans allow yourself to be led where he wants to take you be careful when you seek help from people when god is not wanting you to remember that they can only give you what he gives to them to give you why should it bother you that you can no longer drink from the faucet you are now being led to drink from the ever flowing spring

6807869 because time consumption is associated with emotional experiences thinking about donating time reminds people of the happiness achieved through helping others
6807870 we argue that thinking about time activates goals of well being and beliefs involving personal happiness in contrast thinking about money suppresses such emotional goals and instead activates goals of economic utility and beliefs about attainment of such goals

6807892 using proteopedia anyone can easily create descriptions of biomacromolecules linked to their 3d structure
6807893 we are presenting proteopedia to the scientific community to judge its usefulness and merit and we truly hope that it will offer an effective and appealing way to convey the link between 3d structure and function
6807894 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6807895 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6807896 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6807897 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6807898 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6807899 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6807900 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6807901 the ark of god whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts who dwells between the cherubim
6807902 appoint the levites over the tabernacle of the testimony and over all things that belong to it they shall carry the tabernacle
6807903 to the sons of kohath one of three divisions of levi were assigned the care of the sanctuary which had to be carried on their shoulders
6807904 the sons of kohath shall carry the ark but they shall not touch the holy things lest they die
6807905 only they the levites shall not come near the sacred vessels of the sanctuary that they die not
6807906 the priests must instruct the people and admonish them concerning the due distance they were to keep and not allow them to break the boundaries set before them
6807907 david disregarded gods specific instructions and however pious his intention disaster followed his disobedience
6807908 then david said none should carry the ark of god but the levites for the lord chose them to carry the ark of god and to minister to him for ever
6807909 the levites carried the ark of god on their shoulders with the poles as moses commanded by the word of the lord
6807910 for because you bore it not as god directed at the first the lord our god broke forth upon us because we did not seek him in the way he ordained
6807911 come il frugare nel buio di un occhio spirituale il quale cerca di mettere a fuoco la sua visione nel momento che questo fuoco raggiunto ecco loggetto epifanizzato e appunto con lepifania che si tocca il terzo il supremo stadio della bellezza l anima lidentit di un oggetto balzano verso di noi fuori dai veli dellapparenza lanima delloggetto pi comune la struttura del quale ha preso cos forma stata cos calettata ci appare radiante loggetto compie la sua epifania

6807913 and whatever lies were told the fact that i desired you was never one of them

6807915 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6807916 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6807917 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
6807918 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
6807919 over the last three years online content of all types has exploded part of this is driven by file sharing and video and audio downloading digital fingerprinting is a way to protect property and get payment from expired contracts or non compliant users it is a way to enforce the terms and conditions of royalty agreements
6807920 we use our proprietary algorithms some of the key features we look at are texture color sharpness and arrangement of elements we look at about 12 characteristics in all this gives us an image dna we then build a profile to score the image
6807921 it is not always foolproof there can be problems with its reliability because of work arounds people can apply to make it more difficult to make a match against a database
6807922 with watermarking the image is altered by embedding a hidden identifier in the image the scanning or reading software finds this hidden copyright label it matches up on this image
6807923 it is not a question of what technology is available it is more an issue of how determined you are to catch violators
6807924 widevine believes that the best solution to fight piracy is content protection applied in ways that make a business model work for both the content owners and consumers using content protection for protection of copyrights ad based revenues and other pay media revenue streams while offering flexibility to consumers to use the device of their choice is a much more affordable for all parties involved
6807925 while watermarking does not identify the content like fingerprinting it does provide a nice theft deterrent for potential pirates if they know the content they stole can be tracked back to them
6807926 one of the most popular content is pornography typically we see a lot of homegrown porn this is more easily recognized by low resolution and poor lighting done by amateurs

6807928 we dont figure out how things work we muddle through
6807929 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
6807930 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
6807931 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
6807932 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
6807933 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
6807934 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
6807935 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

6807968 but coming out of this summers tennis activity our feeling is it was time for nike to take that approach and make it a little broader
6807969 we may be seeing two of the best players ever go at it in a way that tennis hasnt seen in a while and its time to see how that transcends from the most loyal tennis fan to all other sports fans or anyone who follows pop culture the underlying idea is that we make sure all of new york knows about this we are asking them to pick a side and hopefully people will get engaged and start talking about it
6807970 we worked with wieden to develop the don king idea and when we brought don in we restructured our original idea around some of his insights

6807972 and nike has always been about collaboration with its athletes so we brought in a promotional expert to help promote the us open and this rivalry in a way that maybe we havent done in a very long time
6807973 well also use the viral video space to make sure that for the next two weeks we continue to push messages celebrating roger rafa the us open and new york city
6807974 capturing the excitement of tennis in new york for the next two weeks
6807975 were keeping our fingers crossed that they do meet thats the whole point and we honestly think that they will especially the way they have been playing lately
6807976 but even if they dont it will be a great moment for nike tennis and these two players and the city of new york

6807995 we may not have much but we have heart and thats what counts
6807996 it should be remembered that international students contribute about 900 million to our economy each year have restrictions placed on how much work they can undertake and pay very high fees to attend educational institutions in this country
6807997 these new rules and fees come on line at a time when ireland is trying to compete with other countries as a destination for international students and when we as a country are trying to double the number of students who come here
6807998 the international student market to ireland is now worth 900 million to the irish economy and this new measure will send shockwaves through the sector and has the potential of putting irish jobs at risk said adrian cummins chief executive of mei relsa
6807999 it is completely unacceptable and unjust to generate revenue on the back of non eu workers and students many of whom are struggling to support themselves and their families
6808000 the costs of providing this system and the administrative costs associated with running it are substantial and this is reflected in the increased fee an element is also included related to inflation since the fee was introduced over two years ago
6808001 i would tell him to come on board and visit the people of gaza as he should have done many many times by now and see the situation himself then act upon what he sees

6808005 you manage to escape from azula but you know its only a matter of time before she finds you again
6808006 in fact we have actually seen selling pressure increase in the face of new demand this worries us because most bull markets usually start from the opposite situation
6808007 we anticipate that the buyers will eventually wear out and the remaining strength in selling will drive the market lower
6808008 as far as we can tell the current market upturn looks like a typical temporary buying episode in a bear market so do not be misled we have not yet had the cathartic selling episode that normally signals a bottom
6808009 it is an incredible honor to be named to the cover of nhl 09
6808010 ive been a really big fan of the franchise for as long as i can remember and am looking forward to being the face of the game this year particularly because of the significant improvements that have been made to the defensive game and the new checking engine

6808015 its just fun what can i say its just as big of a coincidence and chance as if you get a hermaphrodite child what can you do you just need to smile at the little monster
6808016 its interesting to see how a band that made a name for themselves hating napster and downloading practically downloads ideas from a younger and sexier band but think positively maybe metallica does something that we can steal later
6808017 itll just continue with the deathglam that we play in terms of this new albums style i think its more
6808018 it also allowed us to connect to their networks of non best buy people
6808019 figuring these extended networks have similar interests to those working for us already this seemed an easy way to use the dynamic of how information spreads through facebook to a recruiting and employment branding end we also wanted a place to post why youd want to work here kind of stuff like photos discussions and articles we felt this would allow people interested in potentially working for best buy to get a better feel for the real culture and what the actual employees were talking about far beyond what could be communicated via a job posting or banner ad
6808020 they were trying to come up with a way to get real time front line feedback on varioius promotions that were being developed at corporate and run in the stores
6808021 they shopped the idea for an internal social network around corporate but couldnt get sponsorship for it so they just did it themselves neither of them were programmers or developers just creative and smart they started it using
6808022 es muy dif cil en unos juegos hay muchos problemas que hay que ir superando creo que lo hemos hecho suficientemente bien como para estar en una final ol mpica por segunda vez en la historia como representantes del baloncesto espa ol es un orgullo haber llegado a la final una vez m s se demuestra el buen nivel del baloncesto espa ol no s lo de ahora sino desde hace unos a os esto una recompensa para el baloncesto espa ol
6808023 ten amos previsto un tipo de defensa pero nos han batido con un gran porcentaje de tiros hemos hecho un esfuerzo muy grande para derrotar a una gran lituania el equipo ha jugado con ganas de llegar a la final ol mpica y estoy satusfecho porque a pesar de que lituania nos ha jugado muy bien no hemos perdido las ganas de ganar hasta el final del partido eso es muy importante
6808024 es muy dif cil estar siempre bien mentalizado porque el nico premio que hay es pasar a los cuartos de final
6808025 pero con grecia croacia o lituania la mentalidad ha sido muy buena y estoy convencido de que tambi n lo ser en la final la final pase lo que pase vamos a tener oportunidades en la final no s si el dos el 11 el 50 o el 90 por ciento lo que s es seguro es no vamos a repetir el partido contra estados unidos ellos no saben jugar relajados en alg n torneo han tenido alg n problema de estilo de equipo pero s lo saben jugar fuerte
6808026 ves pasar a lebron james y juega de t a t con l y cuando viene t te quedas ah vamos a ver si a estados unidos les pitan los pasos que hacen las faltas y as son capaces de ganar arrasando en cada partido alguna vez esos pasos en el medio campo que no tienen importancia pero otras toman una carrera es imposible pararlos eso hay que pitarlo
6808027 por lo menos un porcentaje alto no se puede poner la lupa diciendo no hay que hacer simulaciones y a se le digo que aguante a james y no se caiga cuando viene hacia ti el trabajo no est hecho pero tenenmos que apurar las posibilidades aunque sea un porcanteje m nimo

6808036 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6808037 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6808038 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6808039 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6808040 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6808041 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6808042 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6808043 i may have been nancy funny but i was not french speaking nancy funny
6808044 we think well have far better oversight and tend to catch these types of things in a proactive way as opposed to being forced to react like we are today

6808073 its going to be really difficult for me to come on set and not get involved
6808074 a big part of america s problem with gun violence stems from young guys walking or driving around with guns and then doing stupid things with them
6808075 flashing a gun at a party might still score points but it would now massively increase your legal risk
6808076 if parents knew that they would could do time for their children s behavior perhaps they would stay more involved in their lives
6808077 the elevation of the gun to sacred political status explains in part why 30 000 annual gun deaths have not given rise to anything like the complex regulation of for example the automobile or pharmaceuticals
6808078 it s time to take some of the politics out of firearm safety
6808079 we believe hanafi did this because he wanted her to give him all of her assets and a divorce outside of the courts so he would not have to pay her alimony or split their assets

6808090 we have planned a number of things in the research and development area
6808091 for instance we intend to engage intensively with the optimization of polysilicon production in the case of crystallization processes among other things we are working particularly on the option of mixing metallurgical silicon with pure silicon
6808092 we are extremely pleased to have such a well known expert as dr albrecht mozer on board this means that along with chief technology officer dr peter fath we have now also secured the engagement of the second company founder of solmic and an expert in the solar silicon area this allows us to safeguard valuable knowhow for the entire group
6808093 as part of our consistent pursuit of our strategy we together with the supervisory board are currently examining the option of integrating sister company thermal solutions gmbh amp co
6808094 mit dieser strategischen akquisition vergr ern wir unseren anteil an dieser wichtigen stufe der solaren wertsch pfungskette

6808100 the environment agency has no staff to oversee those who knowingly flout the weee directive he said
6808101 the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
6808102 it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6808103 we can protect and manage that information as it flows inside and outside of an organisation so that risks are stopped before they have a chance to happen
6808104 had the data on the memory stick been encrypted its loss would have posed no risk
6808105 confident that over time we will start to get sufficient volume to meet demand
6808106 the meeting was positive many delegates raised some questions and the us is pleased with that i remain optimistic and we will continue to make progress
6808107 the nsg will meet again in the near future to work on these constructive discussions
6808108 so far conclusive evidence has not been obtained but in any terrorism case the turning points in investigations always come only after the confessional statements of the accused

6808110 these are committed people imrans old father was medically treated in the civil hospital recently he stayed with him there but the same man was a part of conspiracy that planted a bomb in the civil hospital they have no remorse they dispute the idea of nationalism
6808111 zahid and others think that at last now they are on the right track in life as guided by islam
6808112 sirf aap ko hi jana hai only you want to go to heaven
6808113 we believe in a borderless world nationalism breaks the universe islam unites you should convert to islam
6808114 there will be peace in india if everyone converts to islam
6808115 none of them thought the police will ever catch them even if they are caught they thought it will be for political reasons blasts after blasts took place in india and nobody was arrested so they became brazen

6808125 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
6808126 as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
6808127 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote
6808128 if you look around the south for example youll see that most if not practically all of the blacks elected to state house and senate seats have been elected from majority black districts
6808129 its really very unusual for a black candidate who runs at the statewide level in any jurisdiction at large to get nominated or elected
6808130 one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6808131 those are clearly heights to which you would not have seen african americans move at the time of the i have a dream speech
6808132 they still cant get access to real capital secondly you need business to business sales to grow and the amount of discrimination in the business to business market is very high
6808133 the african american community has traditionally been involved in service type businesses that are not necessarily going to attract equity capital
6808134 whites have not only inherited wealth from their ancestors for a longer period of time they inherit an understanding of our financial system
6808135 the people who still call the shots are of one race
6808136 in fact my best caucasian friend often says ill handle this so we can all be equal now we should probably handle these things together
6808137 whites talk like well the playing field is even now but the playing field in terms of legacy is not
6808138 transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood
6808139 as long as the negros basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one
6808140 is declining very slowly and indeed increasing in some areas
6808141 as long as we live in racially and ethnically separated communities were never going to reach the dream
6808142 for most types of subprime home loans african american and latino borrowers are at greater risk of receiving higher rate loans than white borrowers
6808143 its tough to claim that there is no discrimination in the criminal justice system but a 6 to 1 ratio is far too great a variation to be attributable only to discrimination
6808144 to which stricter sentencing policies unquestionably contributed has freed thousands of law abiding inner city residents from the bondage of fear
6808145 i think martin would be very proud of the progress weve made in some areas like politics
6808146 para el cargo que hizo campa a para la elecci n general
6808147 los abogados replicar n la semana que viene para que el juez resuelva

6808150 this was a hugely enjoyable show that defied my preconceptions massively
6808151 it wasnt the sneering hoot at young single mums but rather a rather enjoyable social experiment how often do you get to say that so with that theres a new series afoot and this time its involving the dads
6808152 young mums mansion really resonated with our viewers and challenged peoples perceptions of single mums
6808153 im delighted the series is returning to the channel and it will be fascinating to see what impact involving single dads will have
6808154 es war sch n nach den simulatortests nun endlich in valencia auf die neue strecke gehen zu k nnen
6808155 wir hatten am morgen noch etwas m he mit dem wenigen grip aber das ging wohl allen so die strecke ist sehr staubig und wenn man von der linie abkommt sind die reifen schnell schmutzig das macht es schwierig konstant unterwegs zu sein wir haben am nachmittag viel am auto ge ndert das war gut und wir konnten viele informationen sammeln die wir nun sichten es war sch n am ende auf den weichen reifen noch eine schnelle runde zu drehen hoffentlich k nnen wir das auto ber nacht noch verbessern und dann im qualifying ordentlich unterwegs sein
6808156 der neue kurs in valencia ist beeindruckend und das gripniveau wurde im laufe des tages besser also wurden auch die rundenzeiten aussagekr ftiger
6808157 wir hatten einen guten morgen und das auto war gut ausbalanciert aber am nachmittag war es fast so als h tte ich ein komplett anderes auto wir haben einige teile f r das training ge ndert die einen gro en einfluss auf die leistung hatten das und einige bremsprobleme bedeuteten dass wir keine fortschritte machen konnten ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir das ber nacht l sen k nnten und im qualifying wieder auf kurs sind
6808158 die strecke ist noch sehr schmutzig und es ist schnell passiert dass man die entwicklungsrichtung verliert wenn sich die strecke verbessert
6808159 die balance des autos ndert sich und die reifen verhalten sich dann anders es gibt auch andere unbekannte wie das optimale abtriebsniveau und die beste rennlinie zudem gibt es die herausforderung die bremsen optimal zum funktionieren zu bringen es gibt viel zu tun und das m glichst schnell wir haben zum gl ck zwei erfahrene piloten was es einfacher macht
6808160 rubens aber hatte bremsprobleme mit denen er leben musste da nicht genug zeit war diese zu l sen
6808161 wenn wir das problem l sen dann sehe ich keinen grund warum nicht beide autos am restlichen wochenende eng zusammenliegen sollten bisher haben wir uns in valencia gut geschlagen aber der lohn geb hrt auch dem restlichen team das in der pause gut gearbeitet hat die fortschritte unserer j ngsten entwicklungen scheinen sich positiv auszuwirken
6808162 before the movie started a debt clock marked the ever increasing 55 trillion debt figure calculated by mr

6808166 u s sees much to fear in a hostile russia
6808167 the cylons were created by man they rebelled they evolved they look and feel human some are programmed to think they are human there are many copies and they have a plan
6808168 washington fears that a newly emboldened but estranged moscow could use its influence money energy resources united nations security counsel veto and yes its arms industry to undermine american interests around the world
6808169 the list of ways a more hostile russia could cause problems for the united states extends far beyond syria and the mountains of georgia in addition to escalated arms sales to other anti american states like iran and venezuela policy makers and specialists in washington envision a freeze on counterterrorism and nuclear nonproliferation cooperation manipulation of oil and natural gas supplies pressure against united states military bases in central asia and the collapse of efforts to extend cold war era arms control treaties

6808194 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
6808195 when i did my first album i said that when i did a second i wanted gary to write for me i think he is a great songwriter one of britains best songwriters i love take that so it was always a dream of mine that hed write for me
6808196 he said it was fantastic i hope in future gary will play when i sing
6808197 when i was contacted by bryn about performing at the festival i said i would like whoever won the nancy role to sing in concert with me
6808198 i think its important that we help promote the people we choose to win i backed jodie really quietly for the whole time as i really believed in her when people see her do other things they will realise what a star she really is
6808199 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
6808200 but this year i hadnt finalised my schedule for torchwood so i told them to make sure i could have time off to do it
6808201 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
6808202 we moved from cardiff bay to the beach i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here
6808203 i love the people and the place we decided to have our civil partnership in cardiff and the response we got from people was unbelievable our neighbours in sully are wonderful i feel at home here
6808204 we have a house in london because we still work in london but our main house is in wales
6808205 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
6808206 ooh i dont know you will have to watch they are talking about it i would like to see a year hiatus before theres another one you need to put a pause on something when you have such a good thing going rather than flog it like a dead horse
6808207 it was the highest rated show on the bbc that evening ive had a huge response to people saying theyre more open minded now
6808208 teenagers have written to me and said theyre more comfortable with coming out now some were on the brink of suicide but changed their minds im really pleased with that
6808209 theres nothing wrong with who i am or being gay and i wanted people to see that there are always people who wont like me but all i ask is people respect me
6808210 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming
6808211 it was a fantastic race probably the most enjoyable race i have ever had and i am really pleased not just for me but for my coach friends and family who have given me so much support
6808212 mum took me down to the local canoe club when i was 10 and i loved it so much i never looked back
6808213 she supported me all the way and it was a huge regret that she didnt live long enough to see me win the world championships last year
6808214 i went to her grave and left the flowers they gave me for winning it was an emotional moment for me now the focus is on getting that prized gold medal im determined to do it and it will be dedicated to her

6808218 one thing this is a reminder of is the audacity of the roveian up is downism the mccain team is now resorting to

6808220 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6808221 he had by his own shortcomings driven this poor lady to distraction when all she wished was for him to make the best of his life he should have been deeply grateful to her

6808252 una referencia visual ara todas las personas que llegan al centro urbano de sant josep
6808253 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6808254 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6808255 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6808256 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6808257 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6808258 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6808259 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement

6808267 one of my first parts in television was on the bill and its good to be back playing a completely different character this time around
6808268 at first you may think that rob is just a straight forward bad guy but there is more to him than that and his relationship with stevie shows his vulnerable side
6808269 his history with stevie goes back a long way and as the relationship is revisited it is a question of whether their conflicting priorities will drive them apart or not it is a choice between duty or love
6808270 our major concern is theres too much traffic and we believe theres drugs and whatever there
6808271 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6808272 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6808273 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further

6808276 its pretty sad three years into it a coach has to talk a really good player into being aggressive playing the game of basketball if that sounds like im pleased with him offensively or displeased you guys can read into that however you want to because a coach should never have to tell his leading scorer to be aggressive
6808277 there are elections in america now along came a black citizen of kenyan african origins a muslim who had studied in an islamic school in indonesia his name is obama all the people in the arab and islamic world and in africa applauded this man they welcomed him and prayed for him and for his success and they may have even been involved in legitimate contribution campaigns to enable him to win the american presidency
6808278 i hope that the new presidency in the united states i pray for the safety of barack obama and i pray that he can shift the united states attitude to this question but as you know palestine cannot free itself it is a small country against a huge superpower the real problem is not in palestine its not even in london or washington the real problem is in the arab world from marrakesh to bahrain 300 million arabs oil at 136 dollars per barrel if the arabs wanted to solve this palestine problem they could do so in six days

6808291 los organizadores han sido muy valientes se merecen todas las alabanzas que puedan recibir porque han hecho un trabajo estupendo
6808292 creo que este circuito es el mejor del mundo entre todos los trazados urbanos pero obviamente es completamente diferente a alguno de los otros circuitos
6808293 si se tienen en cuenta sus caracter sticas las instalaciones son fant sticas ha sido incre ble la velocidad con la que se ha ejecutado el proyecto y he de reconocer que nunca tuve ninguna preocupaci n sobre los plazos del mismo
6808294 est teniendo sensaciones nuevas y emocionantes diferentes a las de cualquier otro circuito
6808295 me gusta el ltimo sector hay varias frenadas con inercia lateral en las que te mueves del asiento dentro del habit culo son sensaciones que no se dan en ning n otro sitio
6808296 el coche cambia por completo con o sin gasolina factores decisivos como la adherencia o la estabilidad en las frenadas se modifican enormemente la confianza en los frenos ser fundamental ma ana en la clasificaci n es muy dif cil hacer una vuelta perfecta
6808297 cada vez que hemos entrado en pista hab a m s goma en el asfalto y m s grip adherencia que en la anterior
6808298 estos primeros d as de competici n en un circuito nuevo son complicados para todos la pista es buena aunque hay que encontrar los puntos clave cuanto antes hay sectores en los que hay que estar muy concentrado este no es un circuito urbano al uso sino que tiene algo m s
6808299 estamos evolucionando carrera tras carrera creo que actualmente estamos en disposici n de estar entre los seis primeros en la clasificaci n y mantenernos en los puntos en la carrera la victoria creo que es imposible pero espero que este fin de semana suponga un paso adelante para nosotros
6808300 no podemos olvidar que cuando empec a ganar carreras ninguna televisi n nacional daba en directo las carreras mientras que ahora incluso se retransmiten los test de invierno ha habido un gran cambio en todo el pa s yo estoy en medio de todo esto y estoy feliz
6808301 no creo que sea una zona conflictiva ni peligrosa porque si te mantienes a la derecha hay buen acceso al pit lane adem s los veh culos que vayan por delante de ti tienen espacio para frenar un poco m s tarde de modo que no molestan hoy he pisado la l nea y he cometido un error

6808316 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
6808317 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
6808318 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
6808319 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
6808320 trichoplax is an ancient lineage a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
6808321 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
6808322 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
6808323 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
6808324 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
6808325 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity

6808411 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6808412 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6808413 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused

6808421 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause

6808618 i didnt realise what was going on with the left list and by the time i did my name was on the form and i couldnt back out
6808619 i dont know if they will pick me or if i meet their requirements
6808620 it was a shame that mukul wasnt a lib dem
6808621 with labour imploding and the conservatives exiting camden with increasing frequency it isnt surprising that mukul has chosen to join the liberal democrats the political party on the up across north london mukuls commitment to social justice civil liberties and strong communities means he will find a warm welcome in the liberal democrats
6808622 i think there has been a lot of misinformation and maybe that was a part of that
6808623 if you look at academies these were brought in by the new labour government it wasnt the lib dems who brought them in
6808624 we would never accept somebody like that he has shown he is has no principles he has already been in four parties he supported labour then respect then left list and then the lib dems
6808625 you know which party you should be in because of the principles a party has he has shown he hasnt got any he is just going where he thinks the power is he has seen the lib dems are in and has gone there
6808626 i have tried to bring the snp into the mainstream of scotland
6808627 we have a very competitive economic agenda many business people have warmed towards the snp we need a competitive edge a competitive advantage get on with it get things done speed up decision making reduce bureaucracy
6808628 the snp has a strong social conscience which is very scottish in itself one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that we didnt mind the economic side so much we didnt like the social side at all
6808629 any scot old enough remembers that thatchers economics had at their core the belief that mass unemployment was not just a price worth paying but necessary in a modern economy
6808630 far from not minding these economics scotlands communities were devastated by them i remember being a teacher in the early 1980s and seeing the hope of a generation crushed by thatcher and her economics
6808631 the social consequences of thatcherism were disastrous which is why they were resisted so strongly in scotland
6808632 thats why the first minister would never invite margaret thatcher to bute house
6808633 a rather brash young man ive often reflected that there was a considerable amount of fault on my side
6808634 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6808635 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6808636 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
6808637 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
6808638 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet under water
6808639 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6808640 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6808641 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6808642 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6808643 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6808644 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6808645 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6808646 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6808647 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6808648 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6808649 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6808650 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6808651 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6808652 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it

6808655 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker

6808665 the airlines should have broadcast the latest typhoon news in the airport and made arrangements for us to stay somewhere its the first time ive come to hong kong and now i have no idea what to do here

6808708 spa culture has moved from basic treatments such as uncomplicated facials and massages to a growth industry where it seems anything goes from a cornmeal scrub to products with unexpected ingredients such as maple syrup
6808709 the sky is the limit as to what spa goers will pay for a trendy treatment
6808710 ask the therapist about the ingredients and find out if any studies are available to deny or confirm what the treatment promises to accomplish
6808711 depending on where you are in the world the spa menu will often reflect indigenous ingredients but if they seem too exotic for your taste try a patch test first to make sure you will not have an adverse reaction

6808751 while im not familiar with him at all ill be excited if hes the choice
6808752 a candidate can very easily determine who is audience is and say what they want to hear thats one of the reasons i want to know who these people are based on what theyve done in the past
6808753 i like that hes a governor because i think you get that executive experience there i really like his sort of down to earth blue collar style and background
6808754 the party of sams club not just the country club
6808755 between the two of them id rather have governor pawlenty before romney only because romney has been very wishy washy on key issues abortion marriage especially i fear that because hes been wishy washy on them he wont stand as strong as he could when we need him to
6808756 theyre all worried about the vote but i really think that its going to be those people that are on the ground making the phone calls and talking about the issues because i think thats really where its won
6808757 so i think he pawlenty should talk to the social conservatives and reassure them that he shares their values and whats important to them hes going to back up
6808758 with all due respect it is very easy for ceos executives and politicians who all have paid sick days themselves to oppose them for everyone else

6808766 no one has the right to demand a nonemergency medical procedure from someone who finds that procedure morally unacceptable or religiously objectionable
6808767 this case did not involve a life and death situation but only a possible inconvenience one which required the patient to walk across the office
6808768 to even suggest that a physicians religious and moral conscience must yield to the directives of a patient regarding a nonemergency procedure is so clearly contrary to traditional notions of individual liberty and religious freedom that there should have been no question that the court would defer to the constitutional rights of the involved doctors

6808775 faith that my republican colleagues will step up to the challenge and transfer the funds necessary to remain competitive with the democrats i have informed my colleagues that it is now up to them

6808788 youve got your connexions and your drug service you have to travel round the whole of birmingham just to access these services what if you had one that was all together in one house so that young people can get everything from one service
6808789 if youre on benefits you havent got the money to keep paying 3 to go here and there
6808790 there isnt a lot of information out there for us to access and if there is its all in company jargon we dont know that you need to talk to us on our level people should work with us
6808791 i personally think that the options for young people are very limited its all very well going into shared accommodation and shared housing but the options after moving on are very very limited i think if there are more options it means you dont have to depend on supported housing
6808792 supported housing is secure and people are there to listen but once you move on youre by yourself and there are not enough options for young people to choose from
6808793 ive worked with a lot of young people and theyre not ready to have their own accommodation but they have no choice but to get their own accommodation because of that a lot of them lose their tenancy
6808794 a better support structure for vulnerable young people would be great
6808795 not that many people have life skills to cope on their own there are quite a few young people who think its cool to not get an education but it doesnt lead you anywhere in the long run
6808796 they need more life skills and budgeting skills to come off benefits or after living with their parents
6808797 when youve got your own place you feel more confident you feel youve achieved something now im in my own place i feel more confident to go out there and re do my gcses and try to get on a course that will lead me to counselling
6808798 the forthcoming housing reform green paper gives a real opportunity to change the way we deliver housing options to young people so that housing and associated services give them the best possible start to their adult life
6808799 these videos illustrate clearly some of the challenges faced by young people today as well as their hopes for the future its essential that government and the housing sector hear and respond to what young people themselves want and aspire to when considering how the housing system could be changed for the better

6808804 on bank holiday there could be a band of rain in northern areas which will move south for southern areas it will be mainly dry
6808805 i am delighted to announce the launch of kingfisher airlines maiden international service between bangalore and londons heathrow airport we will set new standards in international travel with the unique kingfisher experience that has earned us a 5 star rating from skytrax our customers are our guests not passengers and this is reflected in the unique levels of comfort and entertainment including live television and fine dining options on board together with the warmest indian hospitality offered by a hand picked and extensively trained crew
6808806 at a time when many airlines are rolling back on their network i feel that the carefully selected routes that kingfisher airlines will serve have great growth potential international traffic demand in and out of india remains robust and the unique ties between britain and india generate attractive additional opportunities i believe that the bangalore london route is under served and the launch of kingfishers daily non stop service will exploit the latent potential that exists
6808807 the technical textile industry is at a nascent stage in india and is expected to grow in the coming years which will ensure further development of the country as a powerhouse for technical textiles and expanding market share worldwide
6808808 two of the key application areas in technical textiles geo textiles and build tech could play critical role to improve the overall performance of roads bridges and buildings
6808809 the rising standards of living triggered by nine percent economic growth rate have thrown open new vistas for application of technology in areas of technical textiles
6808810 the application is spread across various sectors like infrastructure health agriculture packaging and consumer safety in many industrial countries value added technical textiles accounts for more than 40 per cent of total textile manufacturing activity
6808811 the world market for technical textiles is estimated to be around 23 77 million tones with a value of us 127 billion by 2010 and the indian market of technical textiles growing at a healthy pace of 13 3 percent could grow fourfold to become 37 billion industry by 2020
6808812 however the contribution of the indian textiles industry towards technical textiles has been restricted to low technology and less sophisticated manufacturing

6808816 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking

6808989 salimos agarrotados en el primer set y cuando quisimos reaccionar italia ya hab a conseguido una importante ventaja que nos fue imposible neutralizar
6808990 italia es un gran equipo acostumbrado como nosotros a las grandes competiciones y a los grandes partidos su entrenador andrea anastasi es un gran t cnico y nos cerr muy bien nuestros canales habituales de ataque
6808991 tardamos un poco pero ya en el segundo set comenzamos a variar nuestro ataque y tuvimos menos problemas hemos sabido atacar distinto ha sido un buen partido por parte de ambos equipos
6808992 es una final ol mpica y con eso queda dicho casi todo estados unidos ha demostrado que merece estar en ella y nosotros tambi n ellos ya ganaron la liga mundial este a o y est n en un gran momento de forma

6809059 this is something that we have been working on for about a month or so
6809060 they came out here and practiced and we got a chance to watch them go through their drills and daily habits
6809061 we were able to watch how their coaches approached their players and how their players approached their coaches thats really valuable to a young team which we are we only have five seniors to see that was really important for them
6809062 it was good for our kids to see a national championship program that is doing everything right and they come out and practice just the same as we do
6809063 they run the same drills they talk the same talk and walk the same walk to see that on their own home ground that it doesnt matter who you are it doesnt matter where you come from thats the way you should do it
6809064 coach tressel is a great man and a great coach
6809065 he talked to our team for about 30 or 40 minutes he talked about life lessons that football teaches you certainly our kids arent going to be going to the nfl this is not going to be their job he was really able to relate his experiences to their experiences
6809066 the things that he believes in and preaches weve been preaching
6809067 for him to come in and tell that to our team reinforces the ideas and what we have been teaching our team today was a neat day for the guys they got a chance to see to see a great program and maybe see some role models
6809068 this was awesome you are looking at the best right there watching james laurenitis who won the butkus trophy last year you learn from the best
6809069 i am playing linebacker and i was able to watch the best in the country its probably one of the greatest experiences of my life just watching them practice is going to bring a lot of intensity and focus to us
6809070 i am a huge ohio state fan so this was awesome to see those guys and how they work
6809071 the level of confidence each guy has is huge each one goes hard to the whistle its like a machine almost this really helps our team to see how hard they work and how focused they are i thought todays practice we finally got into it you could feel the intensity pick up everyone wants to get after it thats what we saw this morning
6809072 we are working hard they work hard we run around and they run around its football it should all be the same we are all football players no matter what level you play at we are all playing the same game i really looked at it as a learning experience and tried not to be so much in awe of them
6809073 it was exciting to see all the guys you see on tv but at the same time they are going to school like us and are our age
6809074 they are doing the same things we are they just might be bigger and faster watching the offensive line and understanding how they operate as one cohesive unit helped a lot we have set the bar very high the past few seasons we want to continue to have the kenyon offensive line be the best in the conference
6809075 weve bought some t shirts and i suspect well get some yard signs
6809076 thats one of the advantages of being in the business for awhile you gain a little more experience and you become a little more comfortable with the whole process
6809077 i plan on doing newspaper advertising and id like to get some road signs up
6809078 in the primary i spent probably 700 or 800 out of pocket and im not spending any more out of pocket im just going to have to get money through fundraisers or donations because im not going into debt to try to win this
6809079 i think after the democratic convention is over people are going to be thinking more about the election therefore were going to start working on it harder then
6809080 i wont talk specifics because im not sure if anybody wants to do that when they have opponents
6809081 when you go into a campaign you look at a budget and you look at what you think you might need to raise and once youve done that you look to stay within the budget
6809082 i would certainly expect to spend that much and then after that a lot depends on your fundraising
6809083 when christmas and new years create a full two week vacation that impacts when school can start and end personally i like being able to give two full weeks for christmas students need a break it also has health benefits by allowing for kids to get healthy and buildings to be properly cleaned
6809084 i know parents appreciate common calendars because it facilitates work schedules transportation and even program coordination between schools collaborating on different initiatives is facilitated by common calendars
6809085 its really advanced its more of a hands on learning experience
6809086 i can do it safely for instance we have a fume hood we have showers we have running sinks
6809087 i was really blown away by the support that the community gave
6809088 we didnt really have a goal when we started the fund drive we would have been happy with anything we received when we received the final amount of almost 68 000 that was amazing that was used almost entirely for technology and educational materials

6809090 ive been telling people that im in the best shape of my life i really am ive been training incredibly hard trainings been going really well you might not be able to tell by some of the results but when you take into account everything weve had to go through the last two days i think i did well im very pleased with my score of course im pleased with the medal and the title that comes with the medal i cant tell you how happy i am to have worked for something for so long and finally accomplish it and have my dreams come true im hoping to continue to do this through 2012 i hopefully can get another medal i dont know if anybodys got three medals at the olympic games thats maybe another goal
6809091 im a little bit upset but im also happy i had the chance to come here right after the second jump i knew it wasnt going to be my day
6809092 i was having a hard time with the board but even those jumps didnt feel really good i was trying hard to feel as good as i possible could today it just wasnt there for me i got a bug right after prelims so i dont know if that zapped my energy a little bit i tried to do everything i possibly could to get as healthy as possible but sometimes your energy is not where it needs to be
6809093 i have a lot of work to do the pace was slow but theyre amazing athletes i maintained my composure i know this sounds crazy but i think i could have won that on the right night i still have so much improvement left
6809094 the ethiopians and kenyans like to play around with the pace i just had to deal with it but my legs were tired and it was hard to change gears and just drop it like that i tried to ease into every move because i knew that lactic acid was going to kick in if i went too hard so when they made a move with three laps to go i couldnt get there fast enough and i think it cost me two or three spots
6809095 there was nothing i could do out there i hurt my foot on tuesday ive been getting treatment and our medical staff has been taking great care of me i couldnt run normally from the first move i saw it but i couldnt go its been my goal since the last olympics to come in and run in a final i accomplished that everything was perfect except for hurting my foot
6809096 we got the baton around the track safely there always are good situations that come out of every circle the important thing tomorrow is to run the best we can and win a gold medal we missed out on a couple of gold medals its up to both the men and women to get the baton around the track
6809097 it felt good i didnt get out as well as i could have but i finished strong
6809098 i felt good it was a pretty good race we were pretty even with jamaica the goal was to get around the track and get into tomorrows final hopefully we can just get out there tomorrow and be focused we want to run a good clean race
6809099 this is my first time on the track in the two and a half weeks ive been here we had china in our heat so we had a little extra cheering even though it wasnt really for us it was a great feeling ive never been to a track meet of this magnitude so its been an awesome experience for me
6809100 i found out in the last five minutes that i was going to run at the last minute our coach called me over and asked if i was ready to go i said absolutely i didnt want to take chances i ran conservatively and made sure we qualified
6809101 i was put on the leadoff leg i knew that i had a job which was to get the stick around and put us in a good position to qualify for the final i was able to come out and do my job in the 400 now i have the relay and i was just coming out to have fun i dont have as much pressure as for an individual medal i have teammates and we all come together and were here to do our best and take home the gold
6809102 our main focus was to take care of the baton we cant hang our heads our coach said to run safely and easily and get to the next round i never had run in front of a crowd this big everyone ran comfortably the goal was to get to the next round
6809103 it went really well i was very relaxed we focused on good safe baton passes today we want to redeem ourselves
6809104 where i dont see anything theres nothing on oh my god what the hell is that
6809105 damn that was the biggest bug ive ever seen in my life
6809106 youve been told over and over again the way to get connections in the profession drum up business is network network network you know im right and you know for some people it is just so easy they jump out there do it as naturally as breathing yet you are more introverted less comfortable in group situations dont know how to break the ice or get with the in crowd honestly dont worry but the question remains how do you work with what you are to be successful as a solo practitioner first before you go labeling yourself introvert and extravert yes that is the correct spelling understand the difference and then realize you are what you are and youre not going to change
6809107 i do feel good i think fundamentally we got better
6809108 i feel like we got better as a team in a whole lot of aspects we got through a lot of situations to prepare us for the year now its time to hunker down into one week seasons all year

6809120 the producer packer and consumer all benefit when better quality cattle leave the farm and reach the marketplace
6809121 over time implementation of a bqa program is expected to improve producer profits by emphasizing good recordkeeping practices and protecting herd health through the prevention containment and control of disease
6809122 the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
6809123 this new test will eliminate a lot of the guesswork
6809124 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism
6809125 under that scenario every minute counts in providing treatment or preventing disease spread

6809142 what i also like about xero is that it looks good not something that you immediately think of as necessary when doing your accounts but for me its so obvious the designers have thought about how people work and what they want to be able to look at all the headline data is there for me to see easily which is quite often all i want to know
6809143 the best way i can think to describe how happy i am with xero is i use it all the time from not even looking at the accounts side of the business i am now using xero all the time to run invoices look at the bank statements and all sorts of accounting things i never wanted to know about before and i am enjoying it

6809150 if you were to compare the value of the players of brazil and belgium you have a big difference but on the field today you didnt see this big difference

6809185 we have continued to invest sensibly and appropriately into future proofing auckland airport over the last four years we have invested nearly 500 million in significantly upgrading and expanding all of the key facilities at auckland airport we are now well on the road to delivering on our vision of becoming new zealands airport with the investment we have made we are now coming to the end of this increased capital expenditure phase and looking to the future the airport is in excellent shape to meet the anticipated demand and challenges over the next five years we have a solid balance sheet and strong operating cash flows we have a clear vision and strategy for delivering on our growth opportunities as a business while the current macro economic conditions both globally and locally signal potentially tougher times ahead for new zealand and other economies in the short term auckland airport has planned its long term financial and strategic development programmes well and has the strength and capability to weather inclement conditions
6809186 while the airport is very well positioned to take advantage of long term passenger growth conditions easing global macro economic conditions in the short term the high cost of debt and a slowing domestic economy are together expected to moderate the rate of passenger growth and related business activity although growth in domestic passenger volumes has been pleasing we expect that international passenger growth will remain below the long term average over the next 12 months as market and economic cycles inevitably recover growth opportunities can be expected in coming years masterplan execution progressing well our masterplan charts the aeronautical commercial and land use developments required to meet expected growth in demand for the next 50 years and beyond its ongoing execution has progressed smoothly with several large project milestones reached during the year these milestones include the opening of a new international arrivals area completion of the domestic terminal renovation the commencement of major earthworks on our second runway and the near completion of stage 1 of pier b at the international terminal this new pier which is due to open in october 2008 will increase international aircraft and passenger handling capacity with two gates each with twin aerobridges it will handle the new generation a380 aircraft which we expect to arrive in february next year
6809187 the company is now coming to an end of its four year investment programme which has touched almost every aspect of the airport the company invested 142 9 million this year primarily in expanding and upgrading the international and domestic terminals we currently expect capital expenditure to reduce significantly in the 2009 financial year to around 75 million to 85 million this includes the completion of stage 1 of pier b total of 49 5 million with 9 1 million to be invested in 2009 the ongoing construction of the second runway and property development projects
6809188 i wish to acknowledge the significant contribution made to auckland airport over the last five years by our outgoing chief executive don huse don leaves the airport in a very healthy situation and departs with the boards best wishes and thanks the board also wishes to thank our chief financial officer robert sinclair for his service and dedication over the last three and a half years the board welcomes the arrival of simon moutter as the incoming chief executive simon has joined auckland airport at a time of great organisational opportunity as we look to the future he will guide the airport through the demanding environment currently faced by the aviation transport and travel industries the board is especially pleased with simons appointment which followed a worldwide search for the right combination of skills and experience his attributes include proven leadership abilities infrastructural management and shareholder value creation

6809217 this is a new phase in the navy marine corps relationship particularly with the amphibious navy
6809218 it was well thought out operationally and in its ability to transport marines to places where were going to find ourselves doing missions i think youll find it can do a lot more even than they realize right now
6809219 this ship will enable a meu to perform faster and with greater precision
6809220 it will give the meu commander even more speed and flexibility to meet his objectives
6809221 our approach to the certification piece of comptuex was simple
6809222 our primary focus is on improving ourselves at every opportunity if you do that right an evaluation takes care of itself we continuously seek opportunities to train aggressively with leaders controlling the pace and complexity of how we train so that we dont get people hurt or equipment needlessly damaged along the way
6809223 i would hope to have two or three new players in by the weekend

6809225 his agent who i know quite well gave me a call
6809226 he said jimmy had done as much as he could training on his own and was there any chance of him taking part in a group situation
6809227 ipswich is no exception and we just have to go there and try and play our game
6809228 were not getting carried away with the decent start weve had we just have to go there and be as professional as we can in trying to pick up the three points
6809229 weve got to play our own game whether thats at home or away
6809230 were a team that likes to impose ourselves on the opposition like we did against sheffield wednesday and we need to play at that sort of tempo
6809231 right now weve sent reconnaissance teams to 10 different counties and have additional forces standing by in north florida
6809232 there are another 14 or so counties that may need assistance as this storm passes westward across the state we are well prepared to assist in any high water vehicle missions especially search and rescue and area assistance survey work we work well with our local county and municipal partners and are ready to help them in any way we can
6809233 were maintaining the whole warehouse and just pretty much waiting for the storm
6809234 we have all the trucks stocked and are making sure everything is ready to go
6809235 the rern system gives the state the ability to rapidly deploy a communications network anywhere if the comms have been lost
6809236 and this gives the commanders on the ground the ability to run their operations and get assets out to the people who need them quickly
6809237 this is a very odd storm in the sense that it is moving so slowly and it has zigzagged across the state
6809238 this is a storm that has the unique potential to make landfall five times thats not happened before
6809239 science education caught in the middle in the war between science and religion

6809245 its not as simple as picking the phone up and saying i want him and it happens
6809246 we would be looking for a loan with a view to buy and we have to ensure if it came to buying we have the right funding in place to do that
6809247 i have spoken to gabor a few times and i have said that if he can go and play somewhere then we would look to do that
6809248 he has obviously had a good career and at the age he is he will want to play games
6809249 i have been offended and so i am going to just walk away

6809324 the pa consulting contract involves work on the design feasibility testing business case and procurement elements of the identity cards programme
6809325 the nature of the contract for this service is such that an outturn value is not defined packages of work are agreed monthly the home office has made no commitment to any contract value
6809326 although the total value of the contract will not be known until the contract is concluded i can tell you that the estimated prices given in the successful tender by the contractor were 9 87m for the development phase of the programme and 8 87m for the subsequent procurement phase
6809327 the question is not why was this data lost it was lost because they had it but why anyone got hold of individually identifiable mass data from the supposedly secure police national computer at all no more excuses no more buck passing when is this going to stop
6809328 the home offices policy of casual data trafficking and the ministry of justices stated goal to remove barriers to data sharing are arrogant beyond belief if they did this with pnc data what will they do with your personal identity details
6809329 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco at a cost of millions of pounds to the uk taxpayer

6809352 its the not knowing its alarming not being able to have contact with her its worrying
6809353 its a cause she is passionate about and she has been for some time it was important for her to be involved in this and she was aware that she might be arrested
6809354 aware and thinking that shes held and asking appropriate questions

6809359 it really comes down to the amount of work that has to be done the material things arent easy and everybody has to write checks but the difficult part is the amount of time and effort that goes into the customization of the race cars and the trailer and the pit equipment and that type of thing thats where the biggest loss really is its time from a financial perspective its never easy and never fun but you run a similar risk every weekend when you crash a racecar
6809360 the transporter is about 350 000 or 400 000 along with the contents obviously you have two race cars at the end of the day you can say theyre 400 000 you can say theyre 600 000 but who knows there are certain parts of the car that are going to be salvageable and certain parts that arent total estimate is probably more than one million dollars and less than three million dollars
6809361 what we brought here today are very small things very unique tools things you cant buy ill put it that way customization type things things that will come tomorrow on the straight truck are basically the things that we see are somewhat unscathed and easily utilized
6809362 im confident that with the quality of our people anytime we bring a backup car to the racetrack that backup car should be prepared as if its going to become a race car otherwise we shouldnt really have it here at the level we participate at the question will really be if we need to go to a back up car at what state the back up car is going to be in for the weekend
6809363 its our goal to be sure that theyre not but that chance is probably more so than what it would be on a different given weekend
6809364 roger goes right into the technical whys and wherefores of how does that happen what happened whats the extent of the damage the first question he asked was if everybody is ok but beyond that it becomes more of a methodical process with roger theres usually not a lot of emotions on anything rogers pretty much to the point with what the process is going to be and how are we going to be sure that this doesnt affect the outcome of sundays race thats the game

6809369 the city trees as well as your own newly planted trees may require six to eight gallons of water every 10 days
6809370 let those who have eyes to see and ears to hear
6809371 i never heard from her i still havent to this day
6809372 id like to think forgiveness is possible but when her name comes up in conversation i have a tendency to spit out of the side of my mouth
6809373 i realized that i didnt need her drama in my life
6809374 what we found is that when men recalled their own offenses they were more likely to empathize and then forgive but they had to do that emotional work first
6809375 when the women started thinking about their own offenses they tended to feel defensive and guilty and that made it harder for them to forgive
6809376 my father was physically abusive but the most intense hurt was his refusal to talk to me after i hit him
6809377 i just didnt know how to start the process of forgiving
6809378 it wasnt until i was in my forties when i was able to empathize with my fathers situation that he had learned ineffective parenting from his parents and that he was short tempered because he was physically ill that i was able to forgive him
6809379 this was the 60s and early 70s and there were not resources that we knew of to help us
6809380 forgiving my father and my mother for staying helped me learn to trust my instincts and myself be more present in relationships and build loving honest bonds with others
6809381 forgive for love the missing ingredient for a healthy and lasting relationship
6809382 now i can remember good things about him he was an incredibly effective childrens advocate and community organizer in harlem for example
6809383 the things he passed on to me my sense of justice fairness political sensitivity history and my power as a voting consumer are greater gifts than the scars he left behind
6809384 we are fairly confident that he is despondent from the information we have received from his family
6809385 para lan ar um hellfire tenho que dar 17 cliques em v rios menus diferentes na minha mente de piloto isso n o faz sentido eu estico o bra o seleciono a arma e atiro

6809391 in the americas it spending was soft the it industry grows at 4 to 6 percent historically i dont think its growing at 4 to 6 percent right now every slice of the pie becomes more competitive
6809392 the competition wanted the business more than we did they took it at a rock bottom price that made no sense for tech data
6809393 youve got to be responsible in terms of which business we take were really focused on responsible growth for our shareholders
6809394 our revenue in the americas declined some but our profitability grew more than some of our competitors
6809395 this runs in cycles if we stay focused on responsible growth theres an opportunity to act rationally in the marketplace we will stay focused on market segments where theres opportunity for a good return the
6809396 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
6809397 as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities
6809398 we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote
6809399 if you look around the south for example youll see that most if not practically all of the blacks elected to state house and senate seats have been elected from majority black districts
6809400 its really very unusual for a black candidate who runs at the statewide level in any jurisdiction at large to get nominated or elected
6809401 one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6809402 those are clearly heights to which you would not have seen african americans move at the time of the i have a dream speech
6809403 they still cant get access to real capital secondly you need business to business sales to grow and the amount of discrimination in the business to business market is very high
6809404 the african american community has traditionally been involved in service type businesses that are not necessarily going to attract equity capital
6809405 whites have not only inherited wealth from their ancestors for a longer period of time they inherit an understanding of our financial system
6809406 the people who still call the shots are of one race
6809407 in fact my best caucasian friend often says ill handle this so we can all be equal now we should probably handle these things together
6809408 whites talk like well the playing field is even now but the playing field in terms of legacy is not
6809409 transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood
6809410 as long as the negros basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one
6809411 is declining very slowly and indeed increasing in some areas
6809412 as long as we live in racially and ethnically separated communities were never going to reach the dream
6809413 for most types of subprime home loans african american and latino borrowers are at greater risk of receiving higher rate loans than white borrowers
6809414 its tough to claim that there is no discrimination in the criminal justice system but a 6 to 1 ratio is far too great a variation to be attributable only to discrimination
6809415 to which stricter sentencing policies unquestionably contributed has freed thousands of law abiding inner city residents from the bondage of fear
6809416 i think martin would be very proud of the progress weve made in some areas like politics
6809417 my life was sad before because i had to crawl on the ground
6809418 when someone loses a limb they immediately know what theyve lost
6809419 the goal is to restore the healthy self image again so that that person can see themselves whole
6809420 when i finally got into the field of orthotics and prosthetics i said ah ha
6809421 to deliver an artificial limb or brace without follow up doesnt help that person in the long run
6809422 we need to make sure that they have what they need to continue living successfully for years to come
6809423 someone might say i wanna bring 10 people with me next time you come the mixed blessing is theyll bring 50 or 100 people that have physical needs
6809424 the difficulty for me is how do i say no
6809425 it opens a whole other door for many of these folks to experience the world in a way in which theyve never even dreamt of

6809469 almost all provinces have universities but young people cannot accept their quality
6809470 the educational institutes in the provinces are not yet international standard they are low quality thats why the number of students coming from provinces to study in phnom penh is increasing
6809471 young people have the freedom to decide they dont want to study in the provinces and some universities in the provinces do not offer the majors that they want to study
6809472 most parents send their children to study at university in phnom penh even if their provinces have universities
6809473 they think that universities in phnom penh are better quality have more experienced professors and they will have a better chance of getting a job at the end of their course
6809474 the downside is that they have to spend more money than in provinces on transportation food and accommodation
6809475 the quality of the universities in phnom penh are better than in the provinces and they have more choice
6809476 and also i have a much better chance of getting a job because employers prefer qualifications from phnom penh universities
6809477 i didnt want to continue my study at a university in the provinces because there were no good professors and the curriculum wasnt so interesting
6809478 but i also moved to phnom penh as i wanted to see a new environment make new friends
6809479 also i need a job when i finish and if i apply for a job in the city with a degree from the provinces i dont think ill get picked

6809495 you just manage because you need to normally the work takes your mind off the cycling and youre just concentrating on getting the package delivered
6809496 the cycling is hard work but its also an ideal job to do if you enjoy being out in the open and keeping fit ive had days where ive travelled 80 miles or so and it keeps me feeling fresh and energetic
6809497 eva has been with us for eight years now and shes one of the most experienced cycle couriers in edinburgh there are a lot of men employed in this profession so its really good to see that shes showing them all that women can be just as good at the job
6809498 i did my degree in edinburgh and a few years after graduating i studied for a phd in german cinema
6809499 but i was disillusioned and bored so when a friend of mine told me about a summer shed spent as a courier in berlin i just thought it sounded fantastic
6809500 originally id only planned to do the courier job for the summer months and then find another job but its now been eight years and i still love it its not the best paid job in the world which means that i teach german part time and do personal training and sports massage for extra wages but its far better than working in an office all day
6809501 its nice that even though were sending so much information electronically through e mails these days there are still couriers on bikes being used to deliver letters and important documents
6809502 i dont need any model here if youre standing there doing nothing your in charge will have to ask you to leave

6809505 whilst were not suggesting that everything can be inferred from a name at a basic level this research does show some interesting trends over the last 10 years you could argue that the city is becoming ever more meritocratic and that londons financial services sector is now drawing workers from social classes formerly excluded by its elitist image although the countrys top public schools do still contribute a significant number of workers to the city
6809506 after the enlargement of the eu in 2004 the number of eastern european workers in the uk turned from a trickle into a gush since then 580 000 people from poland lithuania and slovakia have registered to work in the uk its clear theyre not all plumbers the number of polish accountants registering for for instance had risen sixfold since 2003 to almost 3 500 last year
6809507 with the citys current emphasis on dubai mumbai and shanghai its all too easy to forget the massive number of well to do french expats working in the square mile there are 300 000 french citizens living in britain today with the majority living here in london unbelievably our capital is now the seventh largest french city in the world in terms of the resident french population we think there are now about 65 000 french people working in financial services in london

6809524 lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed
6809525 and the scribes and pharisees began to think saying who is this who speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
6809526 i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
6809527 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
6809528 the lords words to the apostle peter in matthew 16 19 as to binding and to all the disciples in 18 18 signify in the former case that the apostle by his ministry of the word of life would keep unbelievers outside the kingdom of god and admit those who believed
6809529 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
6809530 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3 000 souls
6809531 to him christ give all the prophets witness that through his christs name whosoever believeth in him christ shall receive remission of sins
6809532 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
6809533 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels

6809538 the secret teaching is not secret in the sense that something has been held back from non initiates rather it is secret because it cannot be transmitted by words or letters it is an inner realization which must be experienced by the disciple

6809542 time magazine has once again placed the obamessiah on its cover
6809543 the practice among editors of putting only barack obama on the cover of their magazines
6809544 survey data is beginning to identify what some people are calling obama fatigue
6809545 he may have predicated too much of his campaign on biography
6809546 that only takes you so far in a general election the coverage may be too much about obama and not enough for obamas cause about his ideas
6809547 the culmination of the story line about obama getting all the media coverage
6809548 theres an undeniable sense among a lot of regular americans that the press has a perspective on political campaigns
6809549 we frankly think its more about senator obamas global celebrity than anything else

6809558 it s still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west

6809578 we dont believe she was taken by another animal so she is out there
6809579 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
6809580 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
6809581 if they cant they should resign but they should not keep occupying government offices and getting paid to do nothing
6809582 a spiderweb of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6809583 now operate in drug trafficking kidnapping and money laundering among other things with no central control or any one gang dominating any of the criminal activities
6809584 that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance
6809585 it is clear that the public is indignant is angry and it has a right to be
6809586 government has fired most of the 862 private contractors from dozens of companies working on the railhead project and only a skeleton crew remains
6809587 rice smiled and if i remember correctly said she had had a chance to deal with georgia and its politicians but had not tasted its wine
6809588 but there will have to be lots of consumer education before they will accept it
6809589 maybe the science community has not spoken enough about this
6809590 but they will be doing it more and more now
6809591 it gives the industry another tool to increase food safety
6809592 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food
6809593 with all the scares that there have been involving spinach this is a good step forward
6809594 why arent they looking at the source of what causes these problems
6809595 the growers and shippers of spinach and iceberg lettuce will conduct assessments to see how effectively this can be accomplished with produce and what investment will be needed
6809596 i think there is a long way to go before irradiation is implemented
6809597 in a way its like erasing your mistakes and saying something is safe that is not produced in a safe manner
6809598 the treatment of food with ionizing radiation can produce a variety of beneficial effects
6809599 however it should be clear that irradiation is not a remedy for unsatisfactory production practices
6809600 it is unlikely that irradiation will have significant nutritional impact on a balanced diet of raw canned and ready to eat fruits and vegetables
6809601 we dont have much concern about the safety of irradiated foods
6809602 ashin gambira said the authorities under buddhist rules had no right to disrobe him or to charge him with criminal offenses

6809608 it is in chinas interest it would be a very important gesture to the rest of the world if they were to say that these restrictions could be permanently removed
6809609 i think there is more common ground between the chinese authorities and tibet than is sometimes realised
6809610 i worked on them overseas it helped to have another landscape to refract them through
6809611 he liked them and made some good suggestions and so i went ahead and found a publisher
6809612 rice smiled and if i remember correctly said she had had a chance to deal with georgia and its politicians but had not tasted its wine
6809613 they have towed him behind the boat scenes reminiscent of what weve seen the japanese fishing trawlers do
6809614 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
6809615 that was the best way it could have been done you put the animal out of its misery
6809616 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
6809617 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6809627 it will do us little good if when the next democrat moves into the white house wall street takes command of our countrys economic policy
6809628 hard to tell the difference between rubin and republican treasury secretary henry paulson the presentation says trumkas critique reflects the concern among organized labor officials that rubin and like minded democrats may win the behind the scenes battle to shape obamas economic thinking
6809629 im hearing rubins name more and more associated with the campaigns economic policy says james torrey a top obama fundraiser and chief executive officer of new york based torrey associates a hedge fund investor
6809630 senator obama made it clear that he would be reaching out to members of that group in the future says another participant laura tyson who worked with rubin as the head of the white house council of economic advisers
6809631 i worry about his influence says leo gerard president of the united steelworkers

6809818 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was
6809819 i think in small districts even in the city of detroit its not unusual for a judge to at least have some knowledge of the parties i mean were talking about the mayor of the city of detroit hes an extremely popular person but again the judge has no personal knowledge of the facts or personal knowledge of the case and hes not related to a party
6809820 detroit is very polarized where the pro kilpatrick versus the anti kilpatrick dynamic is taking on a political identification similar to democrat and republican and in a primary cycle the anti kilpatrick vote outvotes the pro kilpatrick vote by probably a three to two those numbers arent lost on congresswoman kilpatrick or her advisors at a political event last month she brought in washington heavyweight nancy pelosi the speaker of the house to bolster her campaign during her speech pelosi emphasized kilpatricks experience only vaguely representative not only is she a great leader shes also a great mom and she does what moms do she does what moms do
6809821 when he ran for mayor he touted he said i know a lady in washington who sits on this huge budget and thats what he said across the city however we should have ten times more money because of that relationship and we do not have that money because of that relationship
6809822 its really about her it really is now he does put some icing on the cake but its really about her and thats why i decided to run
6809823 she definitely does have a lot of work to do as far as just getting back a good name i feel that the mayor has really damaged that name and so its gonna be really hard for her in this upcoming election
6809824 shes well polished she knows her stuff shes been in the congress
6809825 he said to me just the other day dont worry mummy i know youve had a hard life but ive studied hard and when i grow up i will give you everything
6809826 he wanted to go to university and run his own business
6809827 now he wont get to do any of it my son does not deserve what has happened to him
6809828 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6809829 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centred

6809892 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic
6809893 in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a tradeoff strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
6809894 emotional memories usually contain highly charged elements for example the car that sideswiped us on the ride home along with other elements that are only tangentially related to the emotion such as the name of the street we were traveling on or what store wed just passed
6809895 we were interested in examining whether sleep would affect memory for all of these elements equally or whether sleep might allow some of the event features to decay at a faster rate than others
6809896 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
6809897 after an evening of sleep the subjects remembered the emotional items smashed car as accurately as the subjects whose memories had been tested only 30 minutes after looking at the scenes
6809898 by contrast sleep did little to preserve memory for the backgrounds i e street scenes and so memory for those elements reached a comparably low level after a night of sleep as it did after a day spent awake
6809899 this is consistent with the possibility that the individual components of emotional memory become unbound during sleep
6809900 you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of

6809919 lo de siempre hay que darle m s ca a al tema
6809920 la clave ha estado en el cansancio estamos muertos no mentalmente sino f sicamente
6809921 eso pasa en muchos partidos que se escape el contrario en el marcador luego hemos empatado no marca el partido pero se notaba que ellos hab an salido como aviones y han acabado como aviones
6809922 la ilusi n de ganar la medalla todav a est ah y vamos a tratar de lucharlo como podamos el que se recupere antes de croacia o nosotros creo que se llevar el gato al agua
6809923 s creo que hemos perdido la oportunidad de nuestra vida y despu s de con corea y con islandia era mejor en el otro grupo que eran bicampeones del mundo y de europa y de todo han sido los cruces m s f ciles que pod amos tener en muchos a os ha habido un baj n f sico muy grande muy grande en comparaci n con ellos nos tenemos que comparar con el rival y al final se han llevado el gato al agua
6809924 han sido mejores que nosotros y tenemos que recuperar an mica y f sicamente para el partido del domingo
6809925 no s por qu es tan irregular este equipo nos ha faltado la contundencia que tuvimos contra corea
6809926 el d a que estamos bien nos venimos arriba y el d a que estamos mal vamos para abajo en picado no sabemos poner freno a las situaciones y no podemos recibir 36 goles
6809927 hemos estado todo el partido a remolque aunque la diferencia era poca ellos estaban llevando el partido y no hemos dado la sensaci n de poder engancharlo
6809928 hemos perdonado a islandia no puede ser que en un partido as t metas 30 goles y el contrario te meta 36 o que concedas cinco goles nada m s empezar eso ha condicionado todo
6809929 hemos jugado mal tanto en defensa como en ataque hemos entrado tarde al partido como nos ha pasado otras veces y despu s hemos tenido que ir a remolque
6809930 ahora s lo hay que pensar en conseguir la medalla de bronce hemos venido aqu a por una medalla y nos queda el domingo la de bronce a n podemos ganar esa medalla hay que saber competir y pelearlo

6809959 i pretty much knew exactly what it was when it happened
6809960 in a 10 year span despite the fact that more surgeons across the country are doing them and we may be getting a lower percentage of the overall referrals
6809961 were still doing nearly four times as many a year in terms of surgical volume
6809962 they have to realize that this is an overuse injury
6809963 they have to learn early warning signs but they also have to learn prevention which is to decrease the total volume of throwing
6809964 the most important thing is this issue of adequate preparation from an athletic point of view
6809965 we see a lot of kids who are talented pitchers because they have natural talent but havent trained into athletes
6809966 their mechanics get altered while theyre pitching through fatigue and that overloads the elbow specifically
6809967 if theres a disturbance anywhere along that kinetic chain then the links in the chain are exposed to risk of injury
6809968 if we only let a major league pitcher throw for 100 pitches which is kind of a generally accepted number theres no way we should let a kid get even close to that
6809969 really meant to be guidelines so that people understand that the amount of pitching that the elbow is subjected to is something that has to be monitored carefully
6809970 most of the kids that i see have injured themselves throwing hard
6809971 i may be down two or three miles an hour which doesnt seem like a whole lot but when youre pitching it really is
6809972 you get away with a lot more when youre throwing harder
6809973 im 28 now and ill have a lot to think about this off season i guess
6809974 i still love to play the game but im getting to be old and im not in the big leagues yet so well see what happens
6809975 a fallacy to think that by doing surgery youre actually going to make the person better than they can be without an injury or a surgery
6809976 i just correct it as a misunderstanding that they have
6809977 sometimes just correcting the mechanics is all that has to be done for the pain to settle down
6809978 this was data that was being held in a secure form but was downloaded on to a memory stick by an external contractor
6809979 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor

6809984 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6809985 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6809986 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6809987 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6809988 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6809989 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6809990 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6809991 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6809992 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6809993 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6809994 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6809995 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6809996 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6809997 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6809998 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6809999 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
