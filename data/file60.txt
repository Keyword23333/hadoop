600146 its an obstacle not to let the business run you if youre not careful it can consume you
600147 as that skill set is being cultivated is when i begin to see burnout occur
600148 youre not crazy and youre not lazy sometimes its just natural that it occurs
600149 it cant just be me sitting in my office making widgets anymore

600164 a challenge in these times is the disappointment of we didnt get that job or we didnt get awarded that contract

600232 the guys that build the rigs the guys that service the rigs
600233 companies are very nervous about what the future holds for the economy and markets and dividends are on the receiving end of that uneasiness
600234 companies recognize that if theyve got a strong balance sheet theyve got a really good weapon to have in this environment
600235 companies are aware that by raising their dividend theyre giving a really good signal about their confidence in their business
600236 theres definitely a scenario where these stocks could be worth much more than where they are trading today but that doesnt make that scenario likely right now and it doesnt make the auto companies a good bet these are still businesses you dont want to own right now
600237 theyre selling cars but not making any profits theres no cash flow everything is still stacked up against them we want them to succeed and maybe things would be different with a decent economy right now but a great name alone isnt going to cut it theres no good reason to buy these stocks now and maybe ever

600240 of course we also get more bad comics as well as the good another good thing about webcomics is that it provides an avenue for instantaneous feedback via comments and e mail it also give the comic book creator access to a potential audience of millions globally and a chance to monetize their work via online ads such as google adsense best of all publishing ones comics via the web is cheap as compared to print
600241 the investors gained interest in the venture on the strength of my webcomics
600242 in my opinion its one of the best produced webcomics being made today she publishes it using a comicpress theme a modified wordpress theme which is a popular blogging platform
600243 it was mostly about my rants and raves about my life tv shows movies and other things sometimes i would blog about politics and current events my cousin andrew dela serna then prodded me to start my own politics blog under his alleba com domain that was my first niche blog
600244 i think i have improved a lot in terms of writing skills moreover blogging has expanded my interests paved way for new jobs and careers and increased my circle of friends
600245 we can do that by providing positive content about the island while blogging truthfully about the realities we face i think this common goal has made us one as a community we are all working hard online and offline to encourage more mindanaoans to blog so that mindanao may be viewed in a more truthful and balanced light
600246 i believe that the internet blogs particularly acts as an equalizer it gives same opportunities and has the same limitations wherever you are i guess the only difference is we dont get invited to the offline blog events in metro manila but we have our events here such as the mindanao bloggers summit and the davao food tour that they dont get to attend too so theres really not much difference
600247 the council felt that with the presence of foreign players local players have not been given the opportunity
600248 we are back to the drawing board our focus now will be development
600249 we are not at the status of the english premier league our league is not matured yet therefore some drastic measures must be taken to improve it
600250 many are having problems paying salaries and they cant cope so it is best that we do away with foreign players until the problems are solved

600275 hes athletic hes got a strong arm hes a good decision maker and he has a good grasp of what the overall scheme is trying to accomplish he is a feisty competitive quarterback
600276 he knows whats going on he does a good job of anticipating routes and where guys are going to be
600277 one i just like the competition and being in the elite level of something it just happens that its football two i think i can play here i dont like somebody else telling me im not good enough
600278 in the past when i havent played or been a backup ive always felt if i can keep improving thats all i can control
600279 tom brady was an even better player than i expected him to be
600280 competes every day at practice every day if he falls down he scrambles up and makes a play he plays the game just like he practices
600281 my uncle started it and my mom didnt like it very much
600282 i have to look at the film i really do
600283 its hard for me ive watched so many things its not fair for me to say matter of fact every now and then i look up to see who threw a ball and theyre already over talking to mike martz and im not sure which one it was because they turned again i cant say
600284 im open to all three right now and thats where my mind set is as were all anxious to get to one i am and then again im not i want to know if we do have to get to another if we get to a second quarterback or a third something like that this is not just trying to find out whos one this is also trying to find out who gives us a chance our very best chance to win
600285 theyre using this environment to win deals that they might not have won last year
600286 theres a notion its a safe haven that markets like new york city are ultimately going to retain their value
600287 probably average to a tick below average second base defense
600288 rickies still a below average second baseman defensively but improving he still gets stiff at times
600289 and when he did throw strikes they werent in the right location
600290 really really good even when they were hitting me around thats the best ive thrown the baseball in a month and a half and to have that outcome is pretty frustrating
600291 the only thing i thought about was that when there were runners on second base they were giving locations maybe they had an idea what i was doing guys were leaning at pitches away but even without runners at second it felt like they knew where theyd be
600292 what ive got to do the only thing i could have done more was back them off the plate
600293 i really felt i should have got under their chins a little bit show them its my plate and i didnt do that
600294 he blends in with the lineup when you have so many well known hitters in there and then he seems to pop up down the lineup and get some big hits
600295 weve bought the loan at enough of a discount that we can make special arrangements with the borrower
600296 it will equate to a deeper ability to modify mortgages
600297 borrowers are not represented by an attorney or anybody who can advise them about the legal effects of what theyre signing
600298 they look at us as a direct substitute for television programming for the simple reason that chinese television is really boring

600307 growth in the market for new total desalination capacity should increase by approximately 13 percent per year from 2005 to 2015
600308 it takes a lot of pressure to get the pure water to go away from the salt and it takes a lot of energy to pressurize the water
600309 its not a bad analogy because perceptions are not always based on truth in either case
600310 we expect sales outside the united states to remain a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future
600311 significant numbers of people are willing to vote with their feet to try something different whether its retail clinics or medical tourism
600312 thats one of the two big question marks about this and the other is liability
600313 release earnings issue guidance a few weeks later lower earnings a few weeks after that take more write downs raise more capital start it all over again next quarter
600314 right now we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
600315 what you have here is raising money just to pay off previous equity commitments
600316 potentially limitless dilution of existing shareholders if and when the bank goes to the market for more capital at ever lower prices
600317 the problem is that people buy a fund after the manager has proven that they are a high performer but they sell the first time theres a problem
600318 they wind up chasing performance buying high and selling low instead of sticking with a manager who has proven that they can deliver if you give them enough time
600319 proven that they can dig out of a hole because you have to believe they can create return fast enough to help you catch up from any down period you want them to be able to live up to the expectation you had for the fund when you first bought it which means you have to believe they can get performance back to what you expected over time
600320 when a manager loses conviction in what they are doing thats a problem
600321 go back to why you bought the fund in the first place
600322 and look to see what has changed most managers made their reputation with some periods where they had some trouble unless you are trying to time the market or you see some change in the fund or the hole they have dug for the fund is just too deep you have to give them a chance to rebound or you will never achieve the kind of results that attracted you to the fund in the first place
600323 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of the most iconic brands of the 20th century
600324 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank
600325 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
600326 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
600327 they may not have disposable income today but theyre going to be the middle class of tomorrow
600328 for entrepreneurs and investors its much safer and it makes much more sense to take a mature and proven model from the u s and copy it in china
600329 tell me one u s internet company that has been successful in china
600330 its much more complicated to run an internet company in china than in the u s
600331 if it were to include the name of every individual for whom it processed a payment that would be a whole nother story
600332 this has nothing to do with the crisis in housing
600333 the expected revenue does not seem to justify creating this reporting system and i worry if this is the start down a slippery slope in collecting detailed economic data on citizens

600349 with the resources available to me have i created the very best work that is possible
600350 i feel shes very serious about her swimming and very dedicated i admire her for that
600351 when youre an olympian that carries so much meaning so much weight
600352 a lot of olympians wanted to give back but they didnt know how this program is designed only for athletes and it lets them give back
600353 hopefully it will equate to 12 swims i think ill be up for the challenge
600354 i spent a lot more time working on my dry land cross training
600355 in the past few years ive worked less in the pool and put more time in running i lift weights more than i have ive added olympic lifting which not only builds strength it builds athleticism i also do a lot of pilates and have a workout two or three times a week it makes me more athletic on top of that its fun it keeps me in shape my body is lean and strong
600356 i went into it with three individual events and came out with three individual events i was able to break my world record in the 100 back im very confident going into beijing i feel really really good so far i feel great in the water
600357 its very very deep in the back which has kept me on my toes and figuring out ways to be faster
600358 theyre coming from everywhere hopefully ill keep up with the curve its exciting itd be nice to still be significantly ahead it forced me to figure things out in training
600359 because ive gone to the olympics now and know what to expect its not going to be as overwhelming or crazy
600360 i want to really enjoy it ill always have the five medals i already won im an olympian for life theres still a lot of pressure placed on me im able to deal with it
600361 if youre a gold medal winner youre validated im the defending gold medalist the world record holder i have my work cut out for me im expecting great competition i expect to be challenged hopefully ill be able to come out on top
600362 in oakland tim hudson was the bulldog and then there was mark mulder and my pitching coach back then rick peterson said i was always better at intensity level five
600363 it feels good to behave the way i want to behave on the mound and relax and be nice and easy
600364 playing little league here when youre not worrying about contracts and stuff like that maybe it had some mojo for me
600365 that motivated me big time zito got respected by the manager to get one of the biggest outs of the night and my job was to preserve this quickly
600366 this is pretty much like watching zito on tv when i was in college
600367 he threw at his tempo not speeding up the game it looked pretty amazing that curve ball that went out of the screen i always wanted to throw one of them its not in my bag

600369 i would remind you that falun gong is an evil fake religion which has been banned by the chinese government
600370 i want to prove i can get to 200 innings and go from there
600371 i would like to go out there and pitch the ninth inning every time
600372 but thats up to me i have to lower my pitch count i have those innings when i start a guy off 2 0 and still get him out thats not really efficient i need to throw strikes right off the bat i need to get guys out quicker
600373 im young theyre probably thinking they dont want to blow me out for the season
600374 if the outcome is good you say well it worked out just fine now we can do it all the time but theres too much stuff that can go on that would make it swing one way or another you cant beat yourself up over it there are so many things you cant control
600375 a lot of people have said that its the way he moves im glad to see a young guy from my country have the opportunity to show his stuff and im glad i have the opportunity to help him out
600376 all i ever wanted to do was coach in the nfl your dream is to always coach at the highest level to coach the no 1 draft pick

600379 i felt like my 12 year old son had just hit the winning home run in baseball
600380 i dont look at the quarterback situation as a question
600381 its just a matter of making a decision on who is going to take the first snap
600382 you can tell it is split among guys about who they want to be the quarterback but we know we have to support either one
600383 weve already had a season when our team got ripped apart and we wont let that happen again
600384 we had way too many egos last year and we had people picking sides we have a whole new face that wont allow that now
600385 those guys are loaded over there but people just dont know the names yet
600386 the top three look and play like the last three guys we had but the new guys are bigger
600387 the linebacking corps takes the responsibility in the switch to the 3 4 as the backbone of this team and theres no reason we shouldnt be able to anchor this thing
600388 the 3 4 has awakened this defense and given it new life
600389 im not working in one of those birmingham steel mills
600390 i said if youre worried about my confidence please dont be
600391 ive felt like ive thrown pretty well recently i told him ill do whatever they want me to do but id want to make sure i get some save situations
600392 anyone down there can be used anywhere im not going to make a blanket statement and say youre not my closer street could still close games if you have a closer whos struggling a little bit and lately a couple of guys who are hot you can switch it around a little bit
600393 wherever i go in the whole world the thing that makes me the saddest is watching people take communion in the hand
600394 i think the job that he did last season was remarkable

600402 after president bashir seized power in 1989 the new government disarmed non arab ethnic groups but allowed politically loyal arab allies to keep their weapons
600403 beginning in the mid 1980s successive governments in khartoum inflamed matters by supporting and arming the arab tribes in part to prevent the southern rebels from gaining a foothold in the region arabs formed militias burned african villages and killed thousands africans in turn formed self defense groups members of which eventually became the first darfur insurgents to appear in 2003

600430 inside the house i was hastily packing throwing together everything
600431 we received a call from a concerned citizen reporting long suffering high pitched screams and loud moans coming from inside this house do you know anything about this and would you might if i came inside and looked around

600447 on the storage front weve moved our investments toward open storage and are seeing early returns our first open storage product in what will be a far broader line in the upcoming year known as thumper or the sun fire x4500 grew billings 37 year over year in q4 and again this was driven by the popularity of our open source zfs file system which is the foundation of our open storage product line across the board youll see us expand aggressively in open storage in fy 09
600448 the one area of the product line we are probably most excited about the way we are hearing the most aggressive feedback from customers is everything around open storage and what open storage is doing is really bringing the value of open source software and innovation to the storage marketplace which has been historically proprietary and expensive its somewhat reminiscent of the server market back in the late 90s and the fact that zfs is so popular its just giving us a great opportunity to bring out innovations in flash memory in next generation network attached storage so thats probably their area we feel most confident in
600449 yes thank you youve disappointed versus street expectations in each of the last two quarters and youre lowering expectations once again for fiscal year 09 i guess the question is i understand the environment and i understand that given the us focus or the us concentration and enterprise focus and financial institutions that sun might be a little bit more vulnerable i guess the question is why has sun uniquely disappointed consistently over the last six or seven months relative to your expectations when not one single other vendor has
600450 is there a product issue is there an execution issue have you been overzealous in your guidance but you know your business you know your concentration you know your business models yet certainly over the last six or seven months youve been significantly overzealous relative to your actual performance can you provide a perspective on why that is
600451 i think its pretty unfair to say that were the only company that has disappointed in the last six months but we dont need to have that public debate and disparage anybody else certainly weve been very transparent and very open in terms of what we are trying to go accomplish and weve made it very clear
600452 as you pointed out that we have a number of large customers in the us we have had a historical concentration the number of those customers have been fairly publicly and negatively impacted and that has shown up in our results and thats why one of the initiatives that jonathan talked about is that we will be extremely focused this year on improving the number of customers we have increasing the number we have trying to improve our mix going forward from that perspective so we recognize we have a concentration and are doing everything we can to diversify
600453 i would say that telecommunications was probably the area that was most impacted when we look at q4 on a year over year basis that that particular segment especially in the us was fairly challenged and again we dont need to name names but just looking at the overall industry as you can you can see that there has been some consternation in the us in the telco space and again historically telco and financial services and government have been pretty large for us and id say that all three of those were challenged even the us government in the second half of the year didnt meet our expectations but those are the big three if you will
600454 so were certainly diversifying the customer base that we have were being as aggressive as we can about it but at the end of the day when we see henry paulson bailing out yet another customer of ours in the front page of the sunday paper we dont expect those businesses to recover or their it budgets to recover any time soon
600455 so in the us and europe then is it more of a sales execution issue because when you look at it if you go even back to the storagetek acquisition and the other ones youve done and giving away free solaris youve continuously talked about getting out to more customers but if your products are good then is it just sales isnt able to sell the products and match some of the industry growth rates
600456 when youve got 100 million customer that is not going to be growing its it purchases but instead theyre taking it down 80 thats a lot of new customer acquisition to make up that quickly so were definitely adding customers to our role and were certainly accelerating those activities now but were not necessarily assuming thats going to be a large amount of revenue growth the significant revenue growth is going to come from expanding the share of the customers were selling into and continuing to grow in those economies and parts of the market where we think theres opportunity to do so
600457 we announced a range of restructuring at the end of q3 in our conference call and in effect what were doing is completing the notification process and the accrual process in q1 so its essentially the same restructuring its just a timing of that the majority of the rest of the actions will be accrued in q1 so its the same restructuring not changed not increased just sort of finalizing it and getting to roughly to the levels that we had expected
600458 dont tear the cast off we just left the vets office
600459 suddenly it occurs to me that i am able to choose a response to every thorn and rose i meet i am response able
600460 he looks real familiar is his picture in a magazine or on the internet somewhere
600461 well actually yes he does have his own web site but its kind of a tongue in cheek sort of thing involving his alter ego a husky named colonel taz whos wearing a uniform and sitting in front of an american flag

600463 man when i was a young kid you guys would scare the holy hell out of me every halloween
600464 in things pertaining to enthusiasm no man is sane who does not know how to be insane on the proper occasions
600465 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
600466 i think its an important risk but frankly im more concerned about bombs and guns which are easily available and can be very destructive
600467 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
600468 we have quietly been working on sustainability issues at duke for about a decade
600469 its going to be a yearly rating were hoping to rate more schools
600470 the best way to foster environmental stewardship is to expose our students faculty and staff to a campus that models these principles
600471 i think everybody is interested in it not just students
600472 he has normal blood pressure and no evidence of cardiovascular disease
600473 increasingly its something that the public has an expectation of wanting to know for certain offices i would say the governors office falls into that
600474 i just would want to make sure that they paid their taxes just like i have to
600475 the candidate is seeking an office with a fixed term
600476 and it is reasonable for the voters to know if there are any health reasons that might necessitate a governor leaving before the end of a term
600477 its personal not public information and we are fully complying with all disclosure requirements
600478 i have a record of being extremely open and transparent
600479 were tired of going to the mall because its not family friendly
600480 all were asking is for the picture to move inside so that our families can come back to the mall and we wont have to worry about our children being accosted by these huge sexually explicit photos
600481 cultural amenities are nice but with the challenges facing low and middle income people many of them have little opportunity to enjoy cultural opportunities
600482 i guess the romance is what keeps it so popular
600483 it makes me mad to see this compared to harry potter thats a completely different story and i think its more aimed at middle schoolers whereas this is more of a high school audience
600484 well girls we came here because we heard there would be girls
600485 see im a purist when it comes to vampires they kill people they dont save them theyre not vegetarians theyre supposed to be about the personification of the id indulging the baser pleasures
600486 i can also really relate to bella shes like totally clumsy and so am i
600487 it would just be a terrible thing to lose it
600488 people are on guard for not having chapel hill become a generic place
600489 this is almost a test case its a line in the sand for how chapel hill is going to grow
600490 there has to be a delicate balance to preserve the idealized chapel hill that people come here for but still grow as a town and i think that unwise growth and unwise development could really hamper and destroy the things we love about this town and brought us here
600491 really i thought this was my last stop before god
600492 glen lennox has become one of the iconic places in chapel hill not because of its architecture and not because of its layout but because of the people who have lived there and the life experiences theyve had over the last 50 years
600493 when you take that and say were going to take out every trace of that neighborhood i think people are justifiably appalled
600494 none of the manufacturers could guess any of those would have been cleaned out
600495 with everything else going down this is one business thats going up

600497 he wanted to go up high with that right arm
600498 for a senator with a profile as high as doles one would think this race wouldnt make the list
600499 but the democratic senatorial campaign committee has reserved nearly 6 million in advertising time against the senator and the committee believes state sen kay hagan is one of its best recruits dole has a financial advantage and her early ads helped her regain a comfortable lead in the polls it remains to be seen whether she can hold on to that early edge
600500 people that are concerned about the relationship between driving faster and using more gas have every right to slow down on their own
600501 the amount you save varies from one vehicle to another but if you talk about lowering your speed from 65 mph to 55 it would be somewhere in the 7 to 10 percent range
600502 and this idea is a better deal for those vehicles that have lower fuel economy for say an unaerodynamic suv the savings you get from reducing your speed are more significant
600503 people want to be free to run down the highway at whatever speed they can but there is a need right now especially for environmental reasons to conserve fuel
600504 health care providers are one per square inch in wake and durham and chatham counties

600507 just as soon as they come in i pay them
600508 its very shocking to people when they go on medicare
600509 you sort of have this view that this means my health care will be taken care of but once they get on medicare its not all easy going from there on out
600510 medicare doesnt have an out of pocket limit and so people who dont have supplemental insurance a medigap plan or something from a former employer can run up very high bills
600511 the 20 percent deductible that they pay for doctor visits is affordable if you are talking about a primary care visit
600512 but if you have a lot of tests and treatment that can run up in the thousands of dollars
600513 this is a very real issue and as health care costs rise it will only get worse
600514 medicare has never covered all of beneficiaries health care costs and with the premiums and cost sharing the bill can add up

600532 south sydney beat the new zealand warriors 18 16 as the rabbitohs recovered from consecutive losses in which they conceded 74 points on friday manly maintained a two point first place lead with a 30 10 win over penrith
600533 its a big game for us and its a big game for manly it will probably be billed as the game of the season
600534 we fear that evaluating our needs and then carefully choosing partners will reveal that there is no one for us to love most of us prefer to have a partner who is lacking than no partner at all what becomes apparent is that we may be more interested in finding a partner than in knowing love

600578 using images from arab tv rarely seen in the west obsession reveals an insiders view of the hatred the radicals are teaching their incitement of global jihad and their goal of world domination with the help of experts including first hand accounts from a former plo terrorist a nazi youth commander and the daughter of a martyred guerilla leader the film shows clearly that the threat is real a peaceful religion is being hijacked by a dangerous foe who seeks to destroy the shared values we stand for the world should be very concerned

600590 wtf who cares about advertising we should be focusing on the systematic rape and murder of entire cultures across our world
600591 pauline gave the order that before you kill the women you need to rape them she ordered another group of these hutu thungs to burn alive a group of seventy women and girls they were guarding and provided them with gasoline from her car to do so again she invited the men to rape their victims before killing them one of the young men told a translator that they couldnt rape all of them because they had been killing all day and were tired they just put gasoline in bottles and scattered it among the women then started burning
600592 some women were penetrated with spears gun barrels bottles or the stamens of banana trees sexual organs were mutlilated with machetes boiling water and acid womens breasts were cut off
600593 a 45 year old rwandan woman was raped by her 12 year old son while her five other children were forced to hold open her thighs

600611 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
600612 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
600613 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine

600654 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
600655 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
600656 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
600657 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline

600667 over a year ago mexico took the positive step of passing a new law to protect women from violence but a law will not prevent women from being beaten raped and abused unless its implemented rigorously at the federal and state level

600683 at issue are dozens of day laborers who solicit work on the sidewalks of old aurora many are undocumented immigrants from mexico and central america you know the kind willing to break their backs fixing our roofs pulling our weeds and cleaning out our septic tanks they are the least powerful among us
600684 the group initiated talks with the city about finding a building in which it would provide english lessons computer training a health clinic and a safer place for laborers to gather

600687 barry never killed jill dando his family do not believe it many members of the police and judiciary do not believe it in the end even two members of the original jury were expressing doubts
600688 barrys disability would have made it absolutely impossible for him to have carried out a crime of this nature
600689 he couldnt have stayed living in the same area for a year and never shown any sign of stress worry or concern she said
600690 it is the end of an absolute nightmare for us all we are really delighted to finally have justice
600691 it was very difficult at times to organise the whole thing from ireland

600693 this news will come as a great relief to his family and their many friends in my limerick constituency they and i have believed for many years that his conviction was a travesty of justice
600694 the verdict is a vindication for everyone including me who believed that the wrong man had been convicted the important thing now for the family and friends of jill dando is that the investigation be reopened and the person actually responsible for her murder be found

600700 u s economy grows at solid pace in 2 nd quarter
600701 much of the improvement came from the one time bump from economic stimulus payments raising prospects of weaker performance in months ahead
600702 while sometimes devastating these global relative price pressures are not the same thing as inflation
600703 the fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases
600704 as consumers spend more money for higher priced petroleum and agricultural goods they eventually have less money to spend on other goods and services other relative prices must then fall
600705 fingered exploding inflation as the biggest risk to the economy
600706 products of public policies which deeply affect markets supply and demand consumers producers and speculators
600707 declining capitalist investment in the productive economy the vast increase of capital flowing in the paper economy the huge increases in profits and the grotesque salaries bonuses and payoffs to senior executives totally unrelated to performance
600708 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain
600709 in asia particularly pakistan india indonesia south korea philippines nepal mongolia and china hundreds of millions of workers peasants artisans and low paid self employed workers as well as housewives and pensioners have engaged in sustained mass protests as they experience a decline in the quality and quantity of food purchases as prices skyrocket in africa hunger stalks the land and major food riots have occurred from egypt through sub saharan africa to south africa in the caribbean central and south america food riots have led to the overthrow of regimes mass protests road blockages from argentina bolivia through colombia venezuela and haiti

600711 when i was serving a sentence on robben island during the struggle to end apartheid in south africa i never suspected that the end of white minority rule in my home country would be the beginning of yet another struggle for justice this time against the world bank and the international monetary fund
600712 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
600713 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
600714 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too
600715 although some of them may have tricked themselves into believing that the neo liberal economic model they defend is immutable like a law of nature most of them probably know that they are perpetrating a fraud of global proportions michael camdessus who retired after thirteen years as managing director of the imf told a group of u s religious leaders that he was willing to sacrifice a generation in order to realize the so called benefits of the macroeconomic model
600716 given the reluctance of india and other developing nations to sacrifice food security measures in the wake of the recent global spike in food prices

600719 the cftcs economists are saying that supply and demand seem to be driving this but we have clients in the business that have experienced these markets for many many years and what im hearing from them is that they dont see any change in the fundamentals of supply and demand
600720 is it a matter of institutional investors seeking shelter from the subprime crisis and the credit crunch
600721 i dont know but i do know that speculators as a class do not agree on anything and yet there is almost unanimity of opinion these days and the money to make the opinions matter the fact that prices have been relentlessly trending up suggests a new type of market participant with a mentality that is traditionally more in line with investing in securities than trading in commodities if enough of these wealthy people or funds or other entities with a lot of capital decide to flip out of securities for a little while and go into commodities and theyre all looking for something that is going up and you get enough billions of dollars thinking that way then their wish comes true
600722 the situation now is that the cftc is sitting there looking at one screen one piece of the picture which is whatever is happening on the exchanges meanwhile an increasing volume in dollars is taking place in the form of over the counter activity where no one can see it there is still a blind spot with respect to the true over the counter activity that is going on which represents billions and billions of dollars
600723 in 2000 congress decided that there were certain kinds of high end investors that were big enough and smart enough that they shouldnt be constrained to do all their business on the exchanges

600757 the pakistan government wants to show that we want to bring terror in our region to an end and that we want to work with the united states for that purpose
600758 but we also believe that there is more that the united states can do as well and that we have asked it to do
600759 they have agreed to take certain measures but it would not be appropriate to make them public so that the results could be achieved
600760 but we are discussing and have agreed to take certain actions to strengthen relations between the two countries and to fight the war against terrorism more successfully so our mutual objectives could be achieved

600765 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
600766 i knew we just needed one or two partnership i was focusing on ten runs at a time thinking lets just get close
600767 i felt we were just one wicket away if we could have got the likes of morne morkel and paul harris in on that kind of deck i felt we could have won the game

600784 you do not expect someone to be traveling significantly below the speed limit on a freeway
600785 anything that contradicts driver expectancy increases the likelihood that theres going to be a crash
600786 people that are concerned about the relationship between driving faster and using more gas have every right to slow down on their own
600787 the amount you save varies from one vehicle to another but if you talk about lowering your speed from 65 mph to 55 it would be somewhere in the 7 to 10 percent range
600788 and this idea is a better deal for those vehicles that have lower fuel economy for say an unaerodynamic suv the savings you get from reducing your speed are more significant
600789 people want to be free to run down the highway at whatever speed they can but there is a need right now especially for environmental reasons to conserve fuel

600822 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
600823 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
600824 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
600825 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
600826 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in

600829 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the start
600830 most experts are in agreement that its inevitable that we will become totally infested over time
600831 when that will happen i cant say its pretty grim
600832 it got here by accident and its taking advantage of the food source here
600833 this isnt the first time this kind of thing happened
600834 these things happen and its not coincidental that theyre all invasive pests that cause these things
600835 ash is a very popular tree because it has a lot of qualities that make it a good tree for landscaping
600836 there is no saving the tree once you start seeing symptoms its kind of too late
600837 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
600838 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
600839 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced

600842 iberia is very interesting to us but the deal is not transformational
600843 even if they achieve only half that its double the 100m profits we reckon the combined airline will make in 2009
600844 i think ba could survive as an independent carrier but we are starting to look small compared to other carriers that are consolidating
600845 im not really sure what happened but thats a done issue thats something that obviously people hear stuff im here practicing waiting and i obviously cant wait till the season starts
600846 im in a great frame of mind why wouldnt i be im with a new team a great bunch of guys im looking forward to getting this season on the road and actually looking forward to going into next week and try to put everything together as a team and as an offense
600847 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
600848 i think the discussions are moving ahead and i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
600849 primarily it starts with the fact does brett want to play football
600850 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only two parties can make that determination not me
600851 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
600852 im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
600853 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
600854 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving

600863 i felt really comfortable today as comfortable as you can feel against oswalt
600864 when i saw the empty locker and the no 15 it really brought it home
600865 i am so grateful to mr george steinbrenner and the yankees for keeping it for 29 years
600866 i came in june when nobody was around i wanted to do it alone
600867 i knew it was something i had to do before the stadium was torn down
600868 im hanging out dude ill never officially say it im riding off into the sunset
600869 makes it easier for me i havent thrown in awhile today is probably the first time ive thrown in a few months wouldnt take long though ive been blessed with a rubber arm
600870 but i wouldve liked that opportunity im not going to lose any sleep over it its their decision
600871 maybe they dont want a guy like me in the clubhouse
600872 probably not i was working out in january and february thinking of a chance to get back in the game i didnt get any calls then you start occupying your time you dont want to bring yourself up to be shut down you know i dont want to be put in that situation now its time for these young guys to come out and do the job and hopefully they can
600873 take the headphones off and pay attention to the game and have fun with their teammates theyll see this is a great game
600874 i dont want to say we make it up as we go along
600875 but we go out there without a game plan and we both make an analysis in the first couple of innings what are the hitters trying to do what is the umpire calling whats working for me
600876 im trying to do that every start i make and jose has a great feel for it too he makes changes and adjustments on the fly and not all catchers can do that
600877 i havent been in a pitchers meeting since mid april
600878 rather than hearing about a guys strengths and how i couldnt pitch him here or there id just rather go in with a blank slate and see what was working
600879 it was like a social center crowded with the noble folks from the block and id delight in listening to some great sports gab
600880 they dont give strong well conditioned athletes a chance to finish games anymore when i pitched i got stronger a second wind in the last innings of a game and felt better than i did in the middle innings
600881 managers and teams have different pressures on them now than what we had
600882 if you want to talk pitching ok but i dont care about the home run
600883 its good we put runs up its good we had rallies but i just dont care about that i care that we won
600884 i thought when he hit that home run that it seemed like he did that a lot when he was with the angels

600913 gossip ten pathways to eliminate it from your life and transform your soul
600914 if you want to be called up the torah youll need a jewish name
600915 a rose by any other name would smell as sweet
600916 and whatever the man called each living creature that remained its name
600917 if youd like well go together to a famous tzaddik holy man who can help you find your name
600918 his hebrew name is hirshel he does not like his name i had him make a list
600919 you know that big donor you were looking for hes in israel hes at the western wall right now
600920 youre here in the u s and youre not coming to visit us in el paso
600921 its a matter of kosher food what i am supposed to eat in el paso texas
600922 bier ist die ursache und l sung eines jeden problems
600923 we dont expect a repeat of the sort of weather we had last week there is probably a day of sunshine for most sometime in the middle of the week
600924 they can go through and pick out people that have been buying and selling decide what they want and go and visit those houses its giving them free reign you may as well just hand over an inventory of what youve got in your house
600925 im certainly not going to pass it to any criminals or people like that theres a lot of gun information in here ill have a better look at it and then decide
600926 i dont think anybody needs to be concerned the small amount of data that trademe has provided is really a drop in the ocean compared the 23 000 pages of evidence thats been provided to the police by other sources
600927 when charges are later laid that information must be provided to the defence counsel or if there is no defence counsel to the accused themselves and that is a requirement made by the courts if we dont do that the case can be thrown out
600928 ill ask the world a question thats you and you answer it so my trusty twitter network came to the fore and with one tweet produced 16 responses

600930 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere the australian quoted professor mallavarapu as saying
600931 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
600932 you just add the bacteria to the btex contaminated water and they go straight to work prof mallavarapu said

600935 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site
600936 i have placed 3 quarks daily at the head of my list of web bookmarks
600937 just wanted you to know im one of many who reads and enjoys 3 quarks almost daily
600938 a solution can be found without demolishing the ram setu but it looks that the states ruling dravida munnettra kazhagam dmk and central government which are allies are adamant on demolishing it at any cost but we will not allow them
600939 the role of the bathhouse has shrunk and they have been under a lot of pressure both architecturally and financially
600940 the united nations cultural agency unesco has protected the baths lying inside the old town wall since the seventies but conservations are particularly concerned about those in other parts of the city which have largely been neglected
600941 are used for their original purposes and are affordable to all not just the rich
600942 reviving the role of bathhouses is meant to revive old rituals and customs
600943 i played the best summer hard season in my life so im very happy for that
600944 in the second set i felt well and in some moments i felt i was playing better than him finally he beat me i just congratulate him because hes playing well
600945 day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
600946 rafa always gives 100 percent in every match and on any surface it was a challenge and i accepted it
600947 i feel happy because for sure i will be number one
600948 i do indeed and a right pigs ear youre making of it its my job to sow discord among the teeming masses so that you can comfort them and tidy things up its been like that for yonks
600949 so the moment my back is turned you unload a gross crapulous heap of contention on the world one that was quiescent for years and shove a spike into it
600950 if your grisly highness would deign to be categorical for a moment
600951 there would be less chance of your setting fire to my beard and of my consigning you to eternal damnation tell me just what am i supposed to have done
600952 they are both ways of making people behave in an orderly fashion
600953 ever since you first gave your loved ones permission to make their own gods and go around killing people who didnt follow in their paths of righteousness
600954 but at least i know what i am doing you go round handing out freedoms like infected jelly babies
600955 sit down on something non inflammable and tell me whats bugging you
600956 this has been a slow distillation over a few thousand years in which gradually sensible people have learned to live together and have identified certain actions that are not acceptable to the community on the grounds that they do damage to others and to their welfare the essential criterion the deciding factor is that the evidence must be indisputable and that actual damage must have been suffered the essence the basis of law is that it considers the case it does not judge what a person is but what he or she does all right so far
600957 your honour is being a bit simplistic but ill go along with that
600958 then there is something called religious law which is not law at all but superstition
600959 the proposal to adopt into law one aspect of a religious injunction and its consequent general application including possibly to those who may abhor the religion from which it originates requires that the new law be absolutely disconnected from its religious origin
600960 isnt that what is being proposed it sounds very reasonable to me so what are you beefing about
600961 the immediate screaming reaction of the tabloids to what your hairy agent announced was absolutely human and natural as a reaction it didnt make sense but people are not ruled by sense they are ruled by fear by an overwhelming desire for basic safety
600962 no the separation between law and religious injunction has got to be absolute and stay that way otherwise fear will come back into the land and history will go back to a time of turmoil that even you have forgotten
600963 fear and injustice are your department or so i thought
600964 but i am in the retail trade a little bit here and there but youve just emptied a bulk container of anxieties all over the whole country and now somebodys got to clear up the mess
600965 after every games i have said i am going to retire
600966 but the way i am feeling right now i reckon i can do another one
600967 the team in general is very strong and there is no reason why they wont get the results they are looking for
600968 six or seven years ago there were very few chinese boats in finals
600969 now they are competing physically they are a very big team and a very fast team
600970 i have not paid a single cent for gasoline after driving two thirds around the world so far
600971 in conjunction with its partner in the project international finance corporation rio tinto is currently studying the issues raised in the correspondence
600972 rio tinto remains confident that its arrangements are in all respects in conformity with guinean laws and that it has complied with its obligations
600973 someone asked me the other day what i think about when i push off or when i first get in the water and my answer was i have no idea
600974 i dont think about anything much when im in the water its something lve done pretty much my whole career and it works im not going to change it now
600975 i said look not sniff look down on a single moment sixty two years ago the moment in which you remade time the moment when you allowed mankind to see itself as it was in a single flash of eternity
600976 ok so i let them drop an atom bomb on hiroshima it was a strategic decision true it involved some collateral damage but in total it saved more lives than would have been lost if i hadnt
600977 yes and it also put a full stop to the end of a festival of human beastliness and mutual murder and more than that it was a sign a warning to humanity that unless the stupid bastards stop finding ever more beastly ways of killing each other and poisoning the planet they will commit suicide turn your green and lovely land into a dead rock spinning uncounted years in the emptiness of space a place where to all intents and purposes life love and laughter never existed that was the message
600978 there hasnt been a nuclear war and once that heroic traitor klaus fuchs had sent the recip for the bomb to russia the message was inescapable humanity must either give up the idea that nuclear fission was a weapon of war or commit suicide
600979 at least nobody has let off another nuclear weapon yet
600980 but the military industries stood by the need to have more and better intercontinental missiles because they claimed that if they didnt have more than their potential foes their nation would be undefended
600981 that was bullshit total dangerous bullshit but at the same time it served a greater human need than truth it served the peoples need to feel they were defended against the terrible might of the imaginary enemys ever growing arsenal of nuclear weapons also by pretending that nuclear weapons gave military might according to the quantities held the western powers were hoping it could bankrupt the soviet union and cause it to give up the competition thus the us and its allies thought it might get back the prize of world domination which sole possession of the atomic bomb might have given them it was a vain pointless contest but it gave people the impression that they were being defended
600982 we watched otherwise honourable statesmen come out with resounding porkies like the laughable
600983 if we are resolute in our determination to combat any aggression with all the weapons at our command then at the nuclear brink we can be certain that our enemies will pull back
600984 needless to say our enemies would be telling themselves the same thing the other way round and we would see both sides approaching the nuclear brink resolutely being certain that if they press on the other side is absolutely sure to pull back
600985 that was natos defence policy for europe in the 1980s and if it had ever been put to the test it would have led straight to death
600986 nor would there be any institutions or way of life left to defend
600987 the great enemy of truth is fear and although those pieces of resounding rubbish had the effect of inspiring many hundreds of sensible people to join the campaign for nuclear disarmament the majority of people egged on by campaigns of vilification by hm government against the traitorous cnd preferred the official fairy tale later the dissolution of the imagined enemy the soviet union did make things a bit difficult for the nuclear arms trade but now they have tried another track they will keep the big nukes ready in reserve and quietly concentrate on developing small scale versions for use as starters
600988 the nukes are still being categorised and piled up as weapons of war and the moment the starters fly the big ones will follow
600989 when your loved ones are frightened they lose the ability to think
600990 your world will bring about its own end and destroy everything in it as a result of a small semantic quibble which a child of five could have answered
600991 i am in love with ronnie i should hope hes in love with me we didnt mean to fall in love you cant choose who you fall in love with
600992 people fall in love despite an age gap i fancy him because of the person he is i dont think about his age or the fact hes a rolling stone
600993 it was natural it just happened ive never felt more connected to someone it wasnt like kissing a 61 year old it was electric there was a spark his age wasnt important i didnt think about his age as we were kissing it didnt occur to me
600994 no one would understand our relationship its really intense yeah we are boyfriend and girlfriend
600995 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
600996 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
600997 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
600998 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
600999 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
601000 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections
601001 if the world were a state what sort it would it be
601002 stop niggling about your home made house rules what i want to know is important what happened to all that money
601003 but high finance doesnt exist high finance isnt real it is a vast on going confidence trick
601004 theres too much of it ill try to give you a fairly typical example only listen
601005 basically it is all about money which also doesnt exist or rather is in itself worthless
601006 you cant mend the roof with it money is just a token by which the giver undertakes when requested to hand over to the receiver material of a certain agreed value ok
601007 so money is like a sort of i o u the only difference is that the receiver can keep the tokens and stack them up rather than reconverting them into goods which he may not want at that particular moment but he does this on the assumption that the tokens will continue to have their true value in terms of goods
601008 that sounds reasonable enough at least its preferable to plain barter one can have enough onions
601009 and so as the money tokens are assumed to have a value people either put them in a box under the bed or get together with others who have some money and set up a bank which is there to keep the money safe this banks job is to lend the money carefully to people who need it for their projects and in return the bank gets back more money than it lent that allows it to add interest money to the original depositors heap while keeping the depositoors money safe so that they can have it back whenever they want it
601010 nothing really in fact it is the basis of the growth of what they call civilization
601011 but it only works if the projects that the bank lend money to are going to be able to pay it back and also so long as the bank doesnt lend out more money than it is holding for its depositors taking a chance on the outstanding loans being repaid before anybody notices that they have lent out more than they are holding in the kitty
601012 the bank just borrows some more to cover it you see so long as they can keep the people whose money they look after convinced that it is safe with them the banks can do exactly what they like with it
601013 it would be all right if the depositors had some say in what the banks were doing with their money but they were long ago persuaded to sell out to shareholders who now own the bank and appoint people to run it as a business paying them fees and large salaries to use the depositors money to make more money not for the depositors but for the share holders
601014 because the depositors money hasnt been stolen it has just been quietly borrowed so long as the bank can find the money to pay them the interest the depositors will believe it is still there
601015 but suppose the depositors lose confidence and decide they want to take their money back
601016 well yes that can be a bit of a problem the money may not be there thats why i said the whole thing is based on a giant confidence trick if the bank still has the original money that was deposited with it intact it can give it back honestly and with no trouble
601017 but if the bank has already spent all the money on making loans that it cant get back and has pocketed the fees it will really be in schnuck then it will either have to borrow like mad from other banks and these other banks will charge them a high rate of interest because the chance of their getting it back is very slim or failing that the bank will have to go cap in hand to the treasury that is the taxpayer and ask to be baled out if necessary by printing more pieces of promissory paper money
601018 but for the sake of the whole industry of money making money somebody perhaps a consortium of other banks might see that it would be wise to bale it out they would do this because if any one bank couldnt pay back its depositors it would have to close its doors then every depositor in the country who had put their savings in a bank would queue up in the streets demanding it back the whole banking system would then implode like a pricked balloon
601019 you see a bank has a duty to its depositors to lend wisely on their behalf making sure that the loan is safe and will be paid back thus taking care of the money they are supposed to be looking after but that wasnt profitable enough for the banks shareholders so they started whats called the credit boom in which the banks aggressively sell loans to anybody and everybody even if they havent a cat in hells chance of keeping up the repayments as i said all the banks want is the commission their charge for doing the business which makes their shareholders rich they are eagerly offering credit to anybody who fancies to improve their affluent life style with extra luxuries its been absolutely marvellous like every day has been a birthday
601020 they wont they cant they couldnt people just have to borrow more to cover the interest payments thus stacking up even more debt
601021 do you know the current credit debt the amount of money that has now been lent out and spent on fancy goods runs into trillions of pounds many times more than the deposited capital that is supposed to underpin it the outstanding debt is now more than the gross value of the entire country there is simply no way it could ever be repaid its magnificent
601022 yes but you gave them greed they just worked out a way of using it
601023 but there certainly wont be any tomorrow if great lumps of hard earned money are being pinched and squirreled away by rich people who just want to become richer forty billion pounds could blast a canal through the atlas mountains and turn the sahara desert into a land flowing with milk and honey
601024 but youd have a job raising the capital not enough profit in milk and honey
601025 in the end politics is not simply something about what happens in the formal political arenas including parliament but the pressure that can be brought to bear the changes that other people can make possible and the tide of opinion that allows those of us in public life to make a difference
601026 it is not required under the rules that the premier should meet the president every time he embarks on or comes back from a foreign visit
601027 youre never going to tackle global warming by cutting economic growth or your living standards and whatever people might want us to do there the political reality is that it isnt going to happen
601028 buying presents to impress women has been a key part of mating rituals in humans for some time but it appears that it is the act of generosity rather than the gift itself which is being used as a mating signal
601029 we have found in previous studies that women are attracted to generous men they seem to like heroic types for short term relationships but altruists for long term relationships
601030 generosity could be a way for men to show their suitability to invest in a relationship and help in rearing offspring
601031 the figure is still quite impressive and i estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years
601032 china has become a notable factor in the scientific landscape usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in china so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future
601033 what is this i dont care if i ordered this i wanted a hotdog i may have said ham salad but i was clearly thinking hotdog
601034 when you get yourself in to trouble is when you feel you have to do something and then you get yourself in trouble
601035 why dont they finish with a clip of what you do have
601036 but we do have x other festivals that will give you a taste of columbus youll never forget
601037 we really really really hope people will take it upon themselves to market this for us
601038 we made x now we want you to make it go viral
601039 you have to be funny and irreverent and not push your stuff to hard
601040 la primera luna brillaba alta sobre la ciudad cuando paul con su escudo activado y brillando debilmente emergio de la calle sin salida un viento levantaba arena y povo que obligaba al enano bijaz a parpadear y protegerse los ojos
601041 chelseas national awards are a credit to her twirling talent and athletic ability

601044 moneymaking all in all the time and if youre wobbling online with fun
601045 i think the job that he did last season was remarkable
601046 as ive said before im very humbled to be the razorbackscoach
601047 we will continue to work hard and operate a program razorback fans can be proud of
601048 we have drug dealers and gang members walking the streets and they go after somebody like this
601049 heres somebody who worked hard paid her taxes put money into social security is this the united states of america
601050 what was the sheriff supposed to do with this information not pass it along
601051 its probably easier to let it happen to these people because they have no one to speak for them
601052 but if we let it happen to them theres nothing to stop authorities from doing it to us
601053 tuvimos una conversaci n franca y c lida donde volteamos completamente la p gina

601101 homosexuals want to come into churches and disrupt church services and throw blood all around and try to give people aids and spit in the face of ministers
601102 aids is not just gods punishment for homosexuals it is gods punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals
601103 only 1 percent of the homosexual population in america will die of old age the average life expectancy for a homosexual in the united states of america is 43 years of age a lesbian can only expect to live to be 45 years of age homosexuals represent 2 percent of the population yet today theyre carrying 60 percent of the known cases of syphilis
601104 even without aids the homosexual community is sick and dying
601105 marriage is a factor in the reduction of sexual partners for heterosexuals it reduces the risk of contracting aids which is why to open that possibility for homosexuals would be positive in reducing infection rates

601128 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
601129 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
601130 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
601131 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline

601152 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
601153 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
601154 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
601155 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

601182 if you dont want to fall off dont get on a horse
601183 all course designers all share ideas and experiences because we want to make the sport as safe as possible
601184 im convinced the course builder did his best especially on this level which is the worlds highest level so we think everything is prepared to have the risks as much minimized as possible
601185 it is a high risk sport and that is why people are doing it because they like the thrills of the sport everyone does it of their own free will
601186 it will be the biggest operation by local medical professionals in terms of manpower resources being deployed
601187 statistically it is looking better but it will never be a risk free sport
601188 if it wasnt then we would not have the number of participants that we have because they love taking these risks

601191 laumento delle sanzioni oggi largine pi efficace che il comune pu porre al malcostume con multe pi salate chi si ferma in auto per caricare prostitute e viado sar scoraggiato a farlo e lo stesso vale per chi consuma alcol nei parchi 500 euro sono un buon deterrente per chiunque
601192 lobiettivo arrivare a firmare unordinanza a inizio settembre quando il rientro dalle vacanze acutizzer i problemi di degrado in citt prostituzione e consumo di alcol nei parchi sono i punti fermi ma lavorer per aumentare le multe contro tutti quegli illeciti che creano degrado in citt si pu pensare a una stretta contro i bar e ai locali che vendono alcolici in bottiglia la sera nelle zone della movida notturna
601193 da allora in citt sono stati multati oltre 20mila automobilisti pi di 2mila dallinizio del 2008 a oggi unattivit che nei primi sette mesi dellanno ha impiegato 1 200 vigili che hanno anche controllato 4 068 persone e 3 633 veicoli
601194 laumento delle multe un tentativo di risolvere un problema reale ma che rischia di essere inefficace se da un lato si colpisce il degrado del sesso venduto in strada si fa poco per combattere il vero dramma lo sfruttamento delle donne

601216 i have known nelly for many years and i really admire his work to me nelly is the quintessential definition of the sean john man he has the attitude the swagger and most of all the physique that our customers can both aspire and relate to and lets be honest all of the ladies out there are going to be thanking us for this campaign the images are so strong they speak for themselves we are truly excited to welcome nelly into the sean john family
601217 i have been a big fan of diddy and the sean john clothing line for years so when they asked me to work with them it was a real honor i hope my fans will enjoy this campaign as much as i did shooting it
601218 i dont know where they got those quotes from it wasnt from me
601219 its going to be very embarrassing for spurs because the complaint appears to be on the basis of a story in a paper
601220 the public comments by manchester uniteds manager announcing that he has made an offer for dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players
601221 its embarrassing for them but you know what daniel levy is like hes different
601222 its something to ask chief executive david gill about because i havent really spoken to him about it because ive been preparing for the match
601223 woah may wont be filled of games to play your lives out this is something
601224 at no time during the conversation did i threaten mr schultz in any way either expressly or implicitly regarding his continuation of this lawsuit or any other matter
601225 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
601226 here we are born to be kings were the princes of the universe
601227 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
601228 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
601229 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen today because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
601230 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore stuff like that you know
601231 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
601232 he shining hes happy you know if he wasnt going into this race as good as he could go into a race we would wait on the next spot but hes on top of his game hes doing great he looks great so i have to say that everything is all good
601233 might get some type of injection in a couple of days
601234 the way jerry blevins is throwing and brad ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now
601235 i dont want to say that huston street is no longer the closer it might be more how well the other two guys are doing
601236 its unique enough that i dont think theres a standard operating procedure for handling it
601237 tom and i have talked it over quite a bit but we knew all along that its going to have to be a very fluid project
601238 with this many guys there are going to be a lot of individual ups and downs one day one of them is going to look better than the rest the next day itll be someone else its going to take some patience from us
601239 who plays how much and when wednesday will have to depend on how everyone looks in the practices leading up to the scrimmage
601240 all of them reported in very good condition it was clear during the first practice that theyd all done their offseason work
601241 the pieces are in place for our offense and that includes quarterback
601242 we may not know which one is going to be the starter yet but everyone on the team knows what those guys can do the quarterback position wont be a problem for us
601243 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
601244 i think it is clear that we have an issue here and something is wrong with the system flawed with the system and we have to address it
601245 i think its better for the players i think its better for the teams and most important i think it is better for the fans i think its a disservice when players arent in camp and being paid properly
601246 we want his contract to reward the impact he has had on our athletic revenue streams but he is almost as important to the whole greenville community said holland citing the coachs fundraising efforts especially the drew steele skip holtz project that has generated more than 500 000 for special olympics training facilities
601247 skip has shown more interest in the contracts of his assistant coaches than he has his own and that is why he has been able to assemble a first rate staff
601248 i love it here my wife loves it my kids love it
601249 my job is to continue to build a winner and contend year in and year out for a conference championship
601250 but overall im extremely encouraged said holtz whose passion permeated throughout the murphy center banquet room and also appeared to rev up his players
601251 it wont be perfect this first preseason game but we have several to get up to speed
601252 the preseason games you dont put a lot of stock in
601253 but the riders and horses will see us every day
601254 weve been involved in many different international organizations since then and he drew on international experts he knows for this team
601255 some of our research here at n c state into tendon and ligament diseases fits well with this kind of event and weve been friends for many years so it kind of came together that way about two years ago
601256 it involves people equipment information money everything its the synchronization of all of that youre building a huge organization and the lifespan of that organization is maybe eight years when you consider they got the games in 2000 its like putting together a whole company like ibm and then after the games they dismantle it
601257 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
601258 you bet your life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
601259 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice

601261 oh except for my one son jared who is 6 2
601262 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
601263 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
601264 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
601265 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
601266 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
601267 ive been doing it long enough to know that if you get caught up in all the hoopla and all the pie in the sky and all the pats on the back youre not going to be very good
601268 you kind of pick the paper up hey were in the top 25
601269 the rankings in december are what matter not the rankings in august
601270 but its really cool to know people have expectations for us were really excited to get this season started
601271 we really cant focus on the hype because we havent played one single game
601272 everybodys out here telling us how great were going to be
601273 we take it very serious hes being punished severely its an act thats inexcusable and it cant happen
601274 regular season games are the ones they get paid in
601275 thats the way well operate and thats the way the landscape is
601276 i think steve understands he made a mistake and hes reacted the right way to it
601277 im sure there will be some people who are upset and rightfully so but ive got a couple of kids you get mad at your kids and cant understand why they did something but you dont love them any less thats how we feel about steve
601278 you cant put a timetable on it the first thing he needs to do is come and talk to the team and im sure hes got that on his schedule i wouldnt expect it to last any longer than that
601279 two games some might say it should be more four games theyd say its too harsh thats the decision the panthers have made thats the direction well go
601280 its an internal matter were going to help him hes still ours yet he is going to have conditions he knows what those are and were going to move forward
601281 i think you need to have the right guys in the locker room
601282 im embracing that im one of them muhsin jon beason and safety chris harris are embracing that fact too
601283 were spreading it among ourselves there is open communication this will not divide this football team
601284 i dont know people were seeing international players getting better it would have happened eventually
601285 no one has heard of ron francis outside of where the snowbirds have migrated
601286 we had some discussion about a larger tire several years ago with nascar when we started this whole discussion about the car of tomorrow
601287 but obviously weve been working with the current size on the car of tomorrow this spring we decided to ramp that new program up
601288 we are working on a larger contain air volume a bigger section width taller tire larger bead diameter
601289 right now its all modeling were trying to figure out what the right size would be
601290 the stat that i always come back to is 3 600 hours that is more than the total from all the other olympics
601291 that is the number i see when i go to bed and when i wake up
601292 the idea is to appeal to the greatest possible audience
601293 there is something for everyone those who want immediate results and those who want a more traditional primetime broadcast
601294 the one thing you struggle to bring to the audience is how unbelievably talented these athletes are
601295 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
601296 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
601297 thats why they run the race miracles can happen and heartbreak stories come out
601298 i tasted a little bit of the chocolate cake last time and now i want a bigger piece
601299 my guys would just push me off and i would put it in third gear
601300 my spotter did a good job of getting me onto the track where i didnt have to stop at the end of pit road again i dont think i would have gotten going at that point it really didnt affect the performance of the car it just made it a little frustrating and added some tension to the day
601301 im confident that by showing respect to the people to the olympics it will put me in a position to continue to have frank and candid discussions
601302 this is an enormous show of face gesture of face for the president to actually go to the olympics
601303 this is chinas international coming out party in many respects
601304 if this man is going as the leader of the free world to one of the most notorious rights abusing regimes in the world and he spends the whole afternoon watching water polo what does that say about where the united states priorities lie
601305 i just want to be able to keep us in games
601306 i dont want him to throw 125 pitches every time out
601307 when he came to take me out i wasnt surprised
601308 i dont know how to swing easy all i try to do is keep my head on the ball but thats the same with everybody if you keep your head on it youll hit it
601309 i just hope i can build on it my first five outings it was hard to realize i was pitching in the big leagues today it was more of a feeling that it was just a baseball game it was the first time i felt like that
601310 i was at the triple a all star game when they announced it
601311 its awesome and i couldnt ask for anything else to happen definitely this is a bigger honor for me to represent the whole country as opposed to just one organization to me this is a bigger thrill
601312 when i was in taiwan i learned very little of the language
601313 not enough to kill somebody but enough to make them think twice we do that with livestock all the time
601314 either we protect and defend old glory at every challenge or we all learn spanish and get used to the chicken and worm on the mexican flag
601315 stop immigration non whites are turning america into a third world slum they are messy disruptive noisy and multiply rapidly lets send them home now
601316 i dont think anyone would be surprised if john wall announced for baylor soon
601317 john is very comfortable with dwon and baylor already was on walls list
601318 theres a whole list of jobs and responsibilities hell have from mentoring kids to helping them become socially ready to relate to society
601319 with coach cliftons experience playing basketball professionally that helps him relate to kids that age which is a great asset
601320 brown has been an important target for state and sidney went out and got him
601321 dont be surprised if howell has a bigger impact on the wolfpack program than j j hickson did
601322 he got 39 points in a game in the aau nationals in orlando last week
601323 right now sean is shooting the ball better than former duke star j j reddick did in high school
601324 sean is 6 5 and stands out there and drills it he is quite a marksman
601325 sidney lowe has put together a tremendous group of players
601326 he takes good care of the ball knows when to throw it away and provides tremendous leadership
601327 our big question is how to replace that many players on that side of the ball
601328 the addition of jake cabell as defensive coordinator will make a big difference he has a wealth of experience and we feel really good about his defensive scheme
601329 weve got a little more confidence knowing how the guys around us are going to perform
601330 theres a little swagger we have weve done this before
601331 i just wanted to try it one more time to convince myself thats what needs to get done
601332 we dont need to sit down we make up a game plan after weve started
601333 you realize very quickly he has a good idea what hes doing his feel for it is impressive
601334 he understands whats going on he knows how to catch
601335 i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
601336 some of them yesterday were on the side of slopes and if you got anywhere above the wrong side of the hole you were going to be 20 feet past no matter what
601337 thats why i was so frustrated finishing second at indianapolis
601338 for us right now theres really not all that much difference between second and say 20th
601339 we dont go for wins any harder than we always do
601340 i get sick of hearing about that whether we try to go for wins harder because were always going for wins we go for them as hard as we can all the time dont think there is a driver thats ever driven in this series that isnt trying to win
601341 is it more important to win in the chase yeah because thats when youre going to win the championship sure is it as important to win during the 26 race season yeah because you get the bonus points but dont ask me if i gamble more to win i go hard man every week every driver does
601342 maybe im taking your question wrong but i guess im feeling that youre asking me if i work harder because it counts more and thats a little bit of an insult if thats how its coming across i want to win every race every one i put it on the line man its really no different regardless of the points and regardless of the time of the season
601343 you just try to go out there and do the same thing every week
601344 try to be the best and try to win races
601345 id say maybe in a race or two we could think about gambling
601346 we need a couple more weeks of some solid runs like weve been having
601347 were not solidly in were right in the middle there we cant start taking too many risks to try to get those bonus points but yet we want to win races and try to stay up front to make sure were solidly in the chase
601348 ill tell you what over the past two years after losing a ballgame this guy does just as good as a job as any anybody we have here putting a stop to that losing streak
601349 you look at his performance hes a gutsy kid he doesnt back off and he gets after it and it shows even though early in the game at times he wavers a little bit boy he collects himself and digs in and does a heck of a job
601350 he kind of knew i was scuffling with my curveball and he kind of helped me have a little more confidence and made me throw my changeup a little bit more and use my slider
601351 sometimes i get stubborn out there and when something is not working ill force it to work and he was good with me in that regard
601352 we had some chances against lilly early but couldnt get the big hit
601353 i had lilly on deck i knew it didnt want to throw him a strike anywhere close to the zone and i threw it right down the middle
601354 that pretty much sums up how my location went all day
601355 they are both good on the defensive end as well and they bring a lot to our table
601356 its kind of interesting they bring different facets of the game jimmy is dangerous with one swing of the bat and reed kind of brings a different factor in the game when hes in the lineup
601357 im going to look like a baby now they got some rules here i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys
601358 i just asked how important it was to him i asked him what he wanted to do hell clean it up a little bit he wants to be treated like everybody else
601359 im not going to waste energy when people talk like that
601360 i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston whatever happened in boston is in the past when people ask about boston i put my brain on pause
601361 from the bottom of my heart i want to thank the fans of boston
601362 i love you guys youve been with me through ups and downs
601363 manny said he didnt want to leave boston i didnt want to leave there were not the only ones that have gone through it theres a track record i played with mo vaughn i played with roger clemens
601364 it just seemed like toward the end if there was a chance a guy wasnt coming back you started hearing more negative stuff about the guy youd hear rumbling about certain people and it seemed like those were the ones who didnt come back
601365 just come and play and move on im happy to be here la is a great city i feel at home here
601366 i accomplished a lot out there in boston two world series and i did a great job thanks to god and well thats in the past
601367 sometimes i have to slap myself and say this is what you really like to do
601368 so the biggest thing i want to do is to encourage kids to swim i want it to be like the tiger woods syndrome the oh tiger can play golf now lets all go play golf the olympics will help give me a platform to do more of that
601369 it is not always about the winning or becoming rich and famous
601370 but just pushing yourself to your extreme to see how fast you can go for as long as you can everyday in practice i just want to get faster and faster
601371 thats never been in my head i do it because i love it and i want to achieve my personal goals
601372 id like to get a little of what steven has gotten
601373 ill still go home to a son who has autism and will for the rest of his life
601374 weightlifting is such a unique sport if you put 100 kilograms on a bar its always going to be 100 kilos so your opponent never changes
601375 one day you can do 100 maybe the next day you can do 102 theres always a weight you havent done i love that
601376 but the second i stepped on a volleyball court my senior year in high school it was all i could think about and all i wanted to do
601377 its an intrinsic thing im trying to better myself in our sport the very top guys are making some money but thats it i was 13th in a world cup meet in japan earlier this year and the prize money didnt come close to paying for everything
601378 when i get tired when i get grouchy thats the time when my coach pushes me even harder he tries to make me uncomfortable so i can be ready for anything that comes my way
601379 but no matter what i do or what i get involved with in the end i just want to be known as a skater
601380 tony is such an iconic figure in these sports and thats not going to change
601381 the tony hawk brand still lives in so many ways from the huckjam to the video games to clothing and apparel becoming irrelevant certainly is not a concern of his
601382 we all understand too that it takes money to make things happen we want to take our show out on the road and showcase our talents and the only way to do that is through corporate sponsors and such
601383 i just maintain a consistent skating level so every time i go back im not afraid to try something that may be more difficult or more dangerous
601384 a solution can be found without demolishing the ram setu but it looks that the states ruling dravida munnettra kazhagam dmk and central government which are allies are adamant on demolishing it at any cost but we will not allow them

601406 ultimately the only way to get them to change would be to make it so painful for them to stay that its preferable to go to another program and learn it instead rather than stay and suffer

601409 much of the reaction from foss folks to news that microsoft is joining the open source census centers on concern that microsoft is what do free and open source software leaders think of microsoft

601417 one of the prime qualities a leading movie star must have is f ability do you honestly think that its talent alone that puts them into leading category as opposed to character actor falling in love with the hero or heroine of the movie is often what its all about if that doesnt happen for you then the movie wont work for you
601418 to make it in this industry you gotta have f ability

601455 the particularities of culture language and tradition are gods gifts to us for they define who and what we are
601456 but we also need to foster openness towards those who are different the peoples and nations of our divided world
601457 i dont think that the best tactic is to come out with names
601458 if we can do one more signing we will do it but it will need to be quality
601459 we dont need money to buy someone and its not just about buying it has to be the right person and that is very difficult at the moment
601460 its not a problem if we dont sign anyone because we have enough young players who can step in but we lost experience and if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it

601467 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
601468 the vision is for there to always be money set aside for young people to control in greensboro
601469 it gives every generation an opportunity to invest in their city
601470 you dont have to give big money to be able to give money away
601471 its not a huge financial commitment its just enough to make you notice
601472 when you combine a lot of people donating 250 its a big deal
601473 the democratic feeling gives it a sense of membership for a small membership fee
601474 the group has an energy that has this can do progressive feel to it
601475 it allows you to see what the needs of a community are and where there are some shortfallings
601476 it adds some legitimacy behind the cause of keeping young professionals in the area
601477 i feel i can be just as much or more of a contributing member back doing this than going and volunteering every saturday morning
601478 i was really looking forward to the opportunity to be with some professionals and be empowered by using our own money to add to the community
601479 i was already contributing to other nonprofits and such but didnt have as much of a hand as i do in future fund in directing where those funds go
601480 you can walk around town now and point to things the future fund has done
601481 that really gave us a huge advantage in getting started and set that momentum
601482 once we sent all that information out it snowballed without that initial grant it would have taken more time
601483 it has become a full fledged operation in about one tenth of the time i expected
601484 most grant making organizations will not make a grant to a nonprofit until its already up and running with financial statements and can put on a good presentation
601485 the future fund is one of the few organizations in town that will take a leap of faith and do some risky grants
601486 a lot of people would say 100 for a rain barrel thats nothing this is a neighborhood where that 100 needs to be used for something else
601487 we could have done part of the program but we would have had to have people pay for their own barrels
601488 probably only a fraction of the number of barrels that will end up in the neighborhood would have been purchased
601489 membership at this young professional age level can put their finger on what theyre doing to help the community
601490 as a young person youre not going to have that access outside the future fund the way you have it in the future fund

601493 if its a struggle to write an essay that quickly then that means its probably a better indicator of who has that natural ability and who doesnt
601494 in that sense its capturing some kind of predictive power of how students will perform in college that is unrelated to maybe study habits or preparation those things tend to be more closely tied with gpa
601495 a writing test is part of those scores and is presumably being used
601496 its a bad policy if youve already got these scores
601497 there is just not enough data yet to make good decisions it remains on the radar however and may potentially be reviewed again within the next several years
601498 i have a whole entire collection of legos at home
601499 at the end of the week theyll build their own robot and theyll let them go against each other and fight each other like the battlebots on tv
601500 that used to be a dedicated acceleration lane thats now a stop people arent paying attention to the stop sign or the stop ahead sign
601501 youre getting on an interstate and you dont expect to see a stop sign at the end of the ramp
601502 there have been a few instances where wrecks have happened there
601503 it doesnt seem to matter how far in advance we make notifications of these signs or these changes people havent been paying attention
601504 time and usage has a way of working those problems out
601505 i would say taken as a whole when you consider the volume of traffic that goes through there im very pleased with the flow of traffic and the small number of accidents weve had
601506 we really havent seen a significant increase in that area since the construction began
601507 we knew who they were checking on and thats all we needed to know
601508 ever since theyve teased me at the museum that i helped the fbi solve the case
601509 they mostly asked a lot of questions we couldnt answer
601510 they wanted to know if they could have a look around i said yes but they never did
601511 it didnt surprise me that he became a world renowned scientist
601512 i assume they were down here looking for documents and checking the walls to make sure they werent hollow
601513 aggravated assaults are very very serious and to have that much of an increase is shocking
601514 im not saying that because i dont think the economy doesnt have something to do with it because in some cases it does
601515 im saying its more complicated than that there are so many factors that affect crime trends you cant just pin it down with one cause
601516 most of the time its your basic stuff because its easy to get rid of
601517 there are so many things that go into it from the climate to the economy
601518 the trends just seem to have a life of their own
601519 im not interested in a 1 or 2 percentage point drop in the achievement gap over a two year time frame i really want to close the achievement gap
601520 ive never seen a superintendent that has the courage to do that
601521 that would be the board saying this is what we want you to do which would give them an out and they would only do those things
601522 its not simple enough to say well have zero tolerance of any misbehavior
601523 in my mind we dont know what those jobs are going to be for the next generation
601524 you almost need to be able to prepare for the unknown
601525 im interested in learning more about mission possible and learning why the decisions were made the way they were made

601548 a week or so ago the hard drive went out
601549 i think people will probably buy because they need to buy something versus because it would be nice to have

601552 perch mi sono rotta di vedere un cox espanso come il polistirolo
601553 we have drug dealers and gang members walking the streets and they go after somebody like this
601554 heres somebody who worked hard paid her taxes put money into social security is this the united states of america
601555 what was the sheriff supposed to do with this information not pass it along
601556 its probably easier to let it happen to these people because they have no one to speak for them
601557 but if we let it happen to them theres nothing to stop authorities from doing it to us
601558 the relationship works out because hes always there to save her from tripping down stairs and stuff
601559 if edward wasnt there jacob would be the perfect thing

601566 that is their choice what they want to wear women can wear a bikini men can wear trunks or they can tan totally in the nude its up to them
601567 yes actually when you use accelerators or other tanning products they have different vitamins and nutrients to help you develop a deeper darker tan
601568 yes they are anyone that comes into this tanning salon has to have goggles or i dont let them tan it could be damaging to their retinas

601571 he said naw turn it into something better and got into the restaurant business
601572 he was a big man they called him fat man but i dont ever remember him being fat fat
601573 a family friend of ours came to me about trouble with food service at the student center at mcg we put a bid in for it and won
601574 but property is hard to get at a decent price near the medical college
601575 were keeping the phone number our phone number is as important as the location

601579 you have to go to the post office to get your mail there
601580 these folks have staff full time staff many of them
601581 they send their staff down there but it might not be unusual to see sean penn down at the post office
601582 in fact he had his oscar sitting in there in his study on one of the shelves in there
601583 it was kind of an interesting side note when people came to see the house
601584 i hate to sound superficial but it will be tough to chase michael phelps through beijing with a microphone in one hand a camera in the other while simultaneously pushing the bangs out of my eyes
601585 remove half the stuff in my suitcase and repack even the airlines preferred journalist rate for overweight baggage is astronomical
601586 top of the to do list is saying goodbye to all the american stuff i love to bits my boyfriend burgers amp fries and reality tv project runway amp a pint of americone dream on the couch with my lawyer better half what a perfectly patriotic way to say goodbye
601587 its not surprising that michael is a world class swimmer because hes got a world class mother
601588 her appearance had not been altered reigh appears to be unharmed
601589 this operation was very well planned you would have seen very little out there
601590 i got a very pleasant call yesterday afternoon that they were able to do the arrest i think they handled it very well
601591 he the agent said that it was blocking his view of the building
601592 he said he was going to call the fire department and that i was going to get fined i was like whatever i took it down it was easier
601593 she looked like she was in kindergarten i had never seen her before i had no idea a little girl was back there
601594 henri bergius is a former viking based in the nordic country of finland
601595 this is just as absurd as before it contravenes article 12 of the u n s declaration of human rights
601596 it will still create a society characterized by self censorship and anxiety
601597 have uncovered evidence that british muslims are actively supporting the taliban and al qaida in attacks on coalition forces in southern afghanistan
601598 there are british passport holders who live in britain who are being found in places like kandahar
601599 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
601600 this is a highly significant mission if we do not win against the protagonists of the 9 11 attacks then those who are against us will take great succour from it
601601 were trying to attract more people to the area who are conscious of quality
601602 the more reputable businesses that come to the area the better the area will be
601603 if people are out in the streets the rest of the bad elements will go away
601604 there are a lot of great things happening in the area so its great to have it out in the daylight for everyone to see
601605 ive heard from people that the streets are cleaner it seems safer at night because there seems to be more good activity in the evenings people are walking around
601606 back in the 70s it used to be pretty lively and we definitely want to bring that back we want to make it a destination
601607 it really seems that a lot of merchants are coming in a lot of new businesses
601608 the problem with gentrification is that it just changes one economic strata for another but the gentrification here isnt changing the strata its just filling the houses
601609 what i like about our neighborhood is its never going to be snooty there arent huge brownstones were always going to be a neighborhood
601610 we would like to see all of these really historical beautiful buildings highlighted
601611 a clue that were really moving forward this is a clue that people are engaged
601612 its an incredible shot in the arm to see this many people energized and committed
601613 these people are prepared to take care of their own community and what you really need is communities taking care of communities
601614 have uncovered evidence that british muslims are actively supporting the taliban and al qaida in attacks on coalition forces in southern afghanistan

601617 this is a highly significant mission if we do not win against the protagonists of the 9 11 attacks then those who are against us will take great succour from it
601618 maybe they can mitigate it down to second degree murder or manslaughter
601619 although it sounds on its surface as premeditated as you can get he walks back gets the gun loads it cocks it shoots one walks to next room shoots another and goes on like that its not quite a self defense argument because that would be crazy but maybe it mitigates the premeditation kind of like a delayed provocation
601620 it is very clear that this was a deeply disturbed young man in a deeply disturbed family in which a gun was available and a tragedy happened
601621 all of that stuff doesnt sound normal to you and me but killing four people is not normal either so its a matter of degree
601622 what it does establish are some facts that might be important one day at sentencing its a factor for a kid who is 15 years old at the time of the incident its a factor that he was depressed and in la la land when it was going on its a factor if he was to some extent a victim i think thats good stuff for sentencing as to why not to give him life without parole
601623 it received a lot of publicity because it was one of the first double patricides certainly in maryland and perhaps in all of the united states it was before the menendez brothers and all of that
601624 they had a swimming pool but the parents would not allow water to splash outside of the pool the kids would get in trouble if water splashed
601625 it was strict beyond imagine and supported by other people
601626 our defense was similar to what it looks like brownings is going to be the proverbial tea kettle ready to spout its whistle or the proverbial balloon that can only hold so much air before its ready to burst
601627 on the night this happened something snapped in larry swartz and he did this to his parents
601628 these facts may but at this point they dont even seem to be approaching the larry swartz set of events
601629 the things we make must not only rise from the ground but return to it soil to soil water to water so everything that is received from the earth can be freely given back without causing harm to any living system this is ecology this is good design it is of this we must now speak
601630 while the mls is anxious to expand west a team in baltimore would only add to a regional rivalry with washington philly and new york

601637 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
601638 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had

601666 red light cameras and speed traps are good ideas in theory but not quite when put into practice they have become a convenient and socially accepted way to fine drivers and increase local revenue while not actually enhancing road safety as studies have shown article after article nationwide cites how red light cameras are used to increase the amount of money certain cities receive from fines how well over half of certain towns operating budgets come from speeding tickets and yet how particular kinds of accidents such as rear end crashes actually increase regardless of speed traps
601667 atkinson added however that some municipalities might not like the idea if this also means potentially decreasing revenue from fines

601701 its getting close enough that a national trend or a stumble by republicans or a brilliant move by the democrats could turn it into a toss up

601716 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me

601722 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

601781 err no but i was thinking of buying one for your friend
601782 yeah you alright baby you look alright still yeah whats your name
601783 you see the thing is i just dont have the time
601784 yet it would be your duty to bear it if you could not avoid it it is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what is your fate to be required to bear
601785 m cht sagen zu dem augenblick verweile doch du bist so sch n
601786 no not if thats all theyre doing wrong and theyre driving safely if theyre speeding or swerving or something like that and they happen to also be on their phone will ding them for it but any cop that pulls someone over just for the cell phone is a dick
601787 yeah thanks for not giving me a ticket for abiding by the laws that you are supposed to protect and serve
601788 this is our honeymoon and we do what we want
601789 im pleased to tell you that the entire plot is illuminated a big part of the perpetrators were arrested in the light of strong evidence that doesnt leave any room for doubt
601790 those who helped abetted and actively took part in the bombings were arrested
601791 we have put two solid months of research into this
601792 reading google patents testing resources building networks it has yielded a strategy that goes so far beyond what anyone else is offering
601793 car dealers who have been looking into it will hear different numbers
601794 some companies have nearly worthless programs that they sell in the hundreds that will not stand up to the changes coming solo seo firms may quote thousands per month not knowing the complexities that face automotive marketing now and more importantly in the near future
601795 we are working with professional automotive blog companies to offer our clients channel marketing as well as blog shielding
601796 it is so important to choose our words wisely when we are boiling with anger and eager to throw bitter words at our opponents it is better to remain silent words spoken in rage will make reconciliation very hard choosing life and not death blessings and not curses often starts by choosing to remain silent or choosing carefully the words that open the way to healing
601797 when we say to someone you are an ugly useless despicable person we might have ruined the possibility for a relationship with that person for life words can continue to do harm for many years
601798 do not use harmful words but only helpful words the kind that build up and provide what is needed so that what you say will do good to those who hear you
601799 nor is it fitting for you to use language which is obscene profane or vulgar
601800 since you are gods people it is not right that any matters of sexual immorality or indecency or greed should even be mentioned among you
601801 remind our people of this and give them a solemn warning in gods presence
601802 words can bring consolation comfort encouragement and hope words can take away fear isolation shame and guilt words can reconcile unite forgive and heal words can bring peace and joy inner freedom and deep gratitude words in short can carry love on their wings a word of love can be one of the greatest acts of love
601803 when we say to our parents children or friends i love you very much or i care for you or i think of you often or you are my great gift we choose to give life
601804 it is not always easy to express our love directly in words but whenever we do we discover we have offered a blessing that will be long remembered when a son can say to his father dad i love you and when a mother can say to her daughter child i love you a whole new blessed place can be opened up a space where it is good to dwell indeed words have the power to create life
601805 telling someone i love you in whatever way is always delivering good news nobody will respond by saying well i know that already you dont have to say it again words of love and affirmation are like bread we need them each day over and over they keep us alive inside
601806 when we say i love you and say it from the heart we can give another person new life new hope new courage when we say i hate you we can destroy another person lets watch our words
601807 when we keep close to the word of jesus reflecting on it chewing on it eating it as food for the soul we will enter even more deeply into the everlasting love of god
601808 lets keep reading gods word with love and great reverence
601809 what we live is more important than what we say because
601810 when our words come too soon and we are not yet living what we are saying we easily give double messages giving double messages one with our words and another with our actions makes us hypocrites may our lives give us the right words and may our words lead us to the right lives
601811 can we only speak when we are fully living what we are saying
601812 we have to trust that our stories deserve to be told we may discover that the better we tell our stories the better we will want to live them
601813 quite often a difficult painful or frustrating day can be redeemed by writing about it by writing we can claim what we have lived and thus integrate it more fully into our journeys
601814 renuncia ya inepta nos tenes harto con tu soberbia ladrona hija de puta
601815 kretina tenes cara de piedra el botox no te deja ni pesta ar y un cinismo a toda prueba asi que no te arrepentis de nada de lo que hiciste y lo volverias a hacer mira que te hemos tenido paciencia en otro pais ya hubieras volado a la mie no cancherees tanto porque estas jugando con fuego
601816 cuando leo opiniones a favor de este gobierno y del anterior lo primero que se me viene a la mente es que son tan mala gente como ellos porque de tontos ya nadie se cree eso
601817 esta mujer cada dia esta mas loca loca loca loca casi destruye el pais y no se arrepiente de nada esta mujer esta llena de odio y rencor se nota cuando habla y cuando mira
601818 very well connected in the business community and the political arena
601819 of the 100 sectors surveyed as many as 67 are poised to achieve excellent to high growth rates ranging from 10 to 20 per cent or more while 12 sectors project excellent growth of more then 20 per cent 55 foresee high growth of 10 to 20 per cent 32 sectors expect moderate growth of up to 10 per cent and one sector has projected negative growth during 2008 09
601820 while the present situation may continue for next two three months the manufacturing industry would be able to revive and achieve higher growth during the terminal period of the financial year 2008 09 provided the government takes some pro active reform measures to redress the genuine grievances of the manufacturing industry
601821 while the farm loan waiver scheme and the proposed salary hikes of government employees will help generate more demand for manufactured items there is need for stimulating consumption reducing interest rates and no further cuts in custom duty on manufactured goods
601822 there is the need for ensuring relief package for exporters increasing rate of depreciation reducing corporate tax rate and correcting anomalies due to inverted duty structure existing in the tax structure
601823 i havent shacked up with anyone since i havent shared my life with anyone
601824 when you split up with someone youre seriously in love with it takes time before you even realise youre upset you know it just hits you

601841 as david miliband said earlier this week labour has to refresh itself
601842 that is not just a question about gordon browns leadership but must also include the policies we put forward
601843 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy tactically it was thought clever to define by reference to tb i e this was not the era of spin we are going to be honest the style would change etc
601844 strategically the consequence was twofold a we dissed our own record instead of saying we are building on the achievements confronting new challenges we joined in the attack on our own ten years a fatal mistake if we do not correct it and b because we were disowning ourselves as a government we junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
601845 so tactically we took the benefit of the anti tb feeling but strategically we ended up accepting our opponents propaganda and appearing incapable of articulating a forward policy agenda
601846 blair is in regular contact with an inner circle of intimates ranging from close political friends such as the european commissioner peter mandelson and former minister alan milburn to former downing street apparatchiks like matthew taylor now running the rsa as well as some serving cabinet ministers including miliband and even brown himself

601882 were not taking things lightly if umno and barisan nasional decide to go rough with bribery then we have to be prepared

601895 pretty much reached an agreement between us and would be drawing up an agreement very shortly and hope to announce the fight in a few weeks but everything is a go
601896 my brother in law orders my sister around as if shes his servant he talks down to her he demands his own way and he tells her shes useless my sister never complains but i can see it hurts her once or twice shes started to open up to me about the way things are in her marriage but she usually clams up as if shes being disloyal or something should i say anything to him he is very nice in public but i have seen how he is in private
601897 ik heb ook opgeschreven dat afellay heel heftig reageerde en dat het daarom wel logisch was dat de scheidsrechter iets terugriep ik vind de hele affaire opgeblazen
601898 ik snap niet dat je eerst z boos reageert en een dag later zegt dat de kous wat jou betreft af is denk dan twee keer na voor je dingen voor een camera roept nu heeft hij mij ergens in betrokken waar ik helemaal niets mee te maken wil hebben aan het eind van het liedje is frank van kouwen de gebeten hond ik kan het nooit goed doen ik moest verklaren wat ik hoorde maar vind het vervelend voor van hulten ik denk dat hij een van de betere scheidsrechters van nederland is en dit niet verdient
601899 aan de ene kant lijkt het slachtoffer niet te willen dat de dader vervolgd wordt terwijl de aanklager er aan de andere kant voor moet zorgen dat dit soort beledigingen bestraft wordt het lijkt me sterk dat de aanklager zegt dat er onvoldoende bewijs is want er is een verklaring van van kouwen en er zijn televisiebeelden waarop afellay letterlijk zegt waarvoor van hulten hem heeft uitgemaakt ik neem aan dat hij dat desgevraagd ook schriftelijk aan de aanklager heeft bevestigd anders komt hij wel h l ongeloofwaardig over
601900 tenzij de tuchtcommissie de ontkennende van hulten geloofwaardiger vindt dan de twee verklaringen van de spelers dat is onwaarschijnlijk wellicht dat het qua strafmaat w l uitmaakt dat afellay zich nu opeens minder gekrenkt voelt
601901 van amsterdam ben ik een beetje gaan houden niemand kent me hier en alles is bijna op loopafstand te doen ik heb hier een onderkomen van mijn sponsor waardoor ik regelmatig op de baan van het olympisch stadion kan trainen het is allemaal vlak bij schiphol waardoor ik zo europa kan intrekken waar alle grote wedstrijden zoals grand prixduels worden gehouden
601902 dat zou na geschiedenis hier in 1928 natuurlijk prachtig zijn alleen kan het niet in het olympisch stadion dat 80 jaar geleden wel geschikt was maar nu niet meer al moet ik zeggen dat de atletiekbaan prima in orde is ik zou best ambassadeur willen worden om de 2028 voor amsterdam de spelen te promoten
601903 helemaal erg wordt het als we een safetycarsituatie krijgen dan moeten we afremmen en komt de hitte van de motor achter in de auto opzetten
601904 maar ik hoop dat ik bij de start meteen drie man kan pakken
601905 fast die h lfte aller ehen in nieder sterreich finden ein fr hzeitiges ende in der scheidung der partner die leidtragenden sind dabei meistens die kinder wir in nieder sterreich wollen familien dieses schicksal ersparen und bieten die einzigartige m glichkeit des n partnerschaftstrainings an
601906 in der heutigen zeit scheint es am bewusstsein zu mangeln dass die ehe auch aufgaben und verpflichtungen mit sich bringt beide partner m ssen bereit sein die beziehung zu pflegen auf den jeweils anderen einzugehen und auch gemeinsam schlechtere zeiten zu bew ltigen mit dem n partnerschaftstraining bieten wir hier ein angebot f r paare die ihr leben aktiv gestalten wollen und bereit sind etwas f r die weiterentwicklung der beziehung zu tun
601907 this is not the kind of behavior we condone in lake in the hills besides i heard this guy has sex with goats
601908 please stop emailing your photos to me trying to become web famous dot com
601909 will citizen communities support high quality journalism ideas models wanted
601910 i just dont understand why they had to shoot this beautiful animal they could have lured it into a paper bag with some tofu burgers and send it to an animal santuary in dubai
601911 oh look i pulled koi fish in britain thats great they have been held for too long im going to set them free
601912 ooo that ones good i got the serial rapists in new yorks state jail system i think ill fight for them to get steak dinners on thursdays
601913 hey the most dangerous criminals on earth being held in the most heavily fortified prison in military history are begging for death i think i should get them some air conditioning wheres cuba anyway
601914 hey my mom is going to watch the baby so we can go out to a nice lunch or dinner why dont you hop in the shower and well drop her off
601915 well my mom has a job interview in the city and we need to watch her daughter this afternoon so no way
601916 ok well then when she picks her up we can go out to dinner right
601917 well no we are going over to my moms house for a barbecue after that
601918 no you cant but if you jump off the roof ill give you a quarter
601919 oh this is 1a we were looking for 2a might as well just punch you in the balls while im here
601920 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
601921 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
601922 at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
601923 tony blair continues to be 100 percent supportive of gordon brown and the government
601924 they will certainly find someone in libya who will kill us
601925 oh my lawd my very good lawd theyre finally letting him free
601926 in the history of africa there have been only a handful of democratically elected leaders who willingly stood down from office mandela was determined to set a precedent for all who followed him not only in south africa but across the rest of the continent he knows that leaders lead as much by what they choose not to do as what they do
601927 when they freed you i was in stirling with my african friends their voices deep swift the syllables from their lips silence like a mat unrolled itself in the room when you left the white prison your face calm with no line of vengeance or bitterness when you raised your hands gratefully like an offering joy exploded from my friends our eyes filmed with tears joy that exploded like wings rushing back to the veldts and woodlands the mountains and plains of beloved mother africa
601928 cultural amenities are nice but with the challenges facing low and middle income people many of them have little opportunity to enjoy cultural opportunities
601929 im confident that by showing respect to the people to the olympics it will put me in a position to continue to have frank and candid discussions
601930 this is an enormous show of face gesture of face for the president to actually go to the olympics
601931 this is chinas international coming out party in many respects
601932 if this man is going as the leader of the free world to one of the most notorious rights abusing regimes in the world and he spends the whole afternoon watching water polo what does that say about where the united states priorities lie
601933 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
601934 john quincy adams understood the world but he didnt have a political gene in his makeup
601935 the presidency has too many moving pieces trying to gauge whether experience matters really eludes measurement
601936 hes quite possibly the worst president in american history because of his inability to effectively manage southern secession and the slavery issue
601937 he has normal blood pressure and no evidence of cardiovascular disease
601938 increasingly its something that the public has an expectation of wanting to know for certain offices i would say the governors office falls into that
601939 i just would want to make sure that they paid their taxes just like i have to
601940 the candidate is seeking an office with a fixed term
601941 and it is reasonable for the voters to know if there are any health reasons that might necessitate a governor leaving before the end of a term
601942 its personal not public information and we are fully complying with all disclosure requirements
601943 i have a record of being extremely open and transparent
601944 weve turned our western lands into a pincushion and gasoline is 4 a gallon and the price of natural gas has gone through the roof
601945 what these data show is that conservation and renewable energy are likely to be the solution to our energy woes
601946 on the oil side the data show that theres just not that much oil out there in the west

601955 he wanted to go up high with that right arm
601956 for a senator with a profile as high as doles one would think this race wouldnt make the list
601957 but the democratic senatorial campaign committee has reserved nearly 6 million in advertising time against the senator and the committee believes state sen kay hagan is one of its best recruits dole has a financial advantage and her early ads helped her regain a comfortable lead in the polls it remains to be seen whether she can hold on to that early edge
601958 im not well versed in contemporary choreography but they invited me to their gala in new york that fall and twylas in the upper room was fresh in my mind when they asked me which choreographer id like to work with
601959 we hung out for an afternoon and said lets do it we got to know each other talking about narrative versus non narrative the pros and cons of each
601960 im not a moviegoer so i hadnt seen his work there
601961 he has a ton of energy he has a lot of range hes very versatile and he had his own rock n roll band who could not love that also he knows his film history and he knows his 20th century classical music history the russians in particular
601962 the music that inspired me in the first place was mostly composed for ballet
601963 i figured ill start and then go play music with twyla and see what she responds to
601964 the first time we hung out listening to a lot of records
601965 she happened to be listening to a scott joplin opera i thought ive never written a rag im going to write her a rag and i knew i was going to use a lot of percussion i wanted to end up with five movements i set myself certain parameters that every movement would borrow from each other i tried to create something where if i had the movements laid out if they were made of glass and i dropped them i would take fragments of each of them and mix them up so that each was borrowing bits from the other
601966 danny had a sense of structure that was symphonic also hes used to action to seeing and then reinforcing so he was ideal from the point of view of supporting action he was very focused a delight to work with he would always take the extra step sending you three versions instead of just two
601967 my only content was a very physical one the difference between a force directed against itself and another person and force directed together outward
601968 it investigated how all rhythm evolves from a single walking step and how any of the metric structures come from that shift of weight right and left
601969 i began to think about right and left to find a sort of duality in the body from that came this feeling of the opposition we all have inside ourselves how we have to work to coordinate that power thats the physical grounding for the scenario of rabbit and rogue those two characters evolved from that the ballet did not evolve in language
601970 even though the material had been shaped on other dancers i could make it my own in terms of the musicality and the intent the dynamic phrasing with this one we went further i spent two weeks mano a mano working with her in the studio in her apartment she gives you a very clear direction to go in but she also lets you play
601971 came through not in a literal or direct way but just atmospherically i start onstage by myself so i set the tone im not a dark force but maybe more mischievous i dont mind creating chaos along the way
601972 i would have done the process over and over again
601973 i cant speak highly enough about her she was just unbelievable to work with the communication the focus she had on us physically and mentally she just homed in on exactly what she wanted she could sense what was going to come out emotionally not just physically if you were frustrated shed like that shed say keep that feeling in there through her choreography the individual comes out
601974 her sense of geometry and symmetry and shaping dynamics in a way thats not what one would think in the broader sense it was so full of surprises
601975 for doing nothing other than pursuing approvals thats pretty generous
601976 this city had serious budget problems for a long time in the post prop 13 era this could be seen as a panacea
601977 a determined lot resilient pioneers forge a new countys future
601978 my understanding is the city of anaheim is just taking it up a notch
601979 take two people and tell them they have the opportunity to split 10 furthermore tell one person that as first mover they get to make a one time offer and tell the other person that as second mover they get the opportunity to either accept or reject this offer if the offer is rejected they both go home with zero
601980 kami merencanakan terminal lama akan digunakan untuk aktivitas pemberangkatan dan kedatangan jamaah haji
601981 being paid less than a truck driver at that time you know that makes a difference in life for me
601982 we wouldnt have won five super bowls if we hadnt won the first two
601983 i assure you we would not have won the first two if it were not for fred dean
601984 this election into the hall of fame has taken me back in time i remember people and places i havent seen in a long time
601985 you get used to getting down in the dirt getting your clothes dirty and wallowing a little bit it makes everything come out right when you can stand up out of the mud and feel comfortable
601986 i was small in size but i tell you dirt cant talk about dirt
601987 what i did was i went off and left my glasses and i cant see my words
601988 i can say this that all of the things that have happened for me and to me
601989 hes athletic hes got a strong arm hes a good decision maker and he has a good grasp of what the overall scheme is trying to accomplish he is a feisty competitive quarterback

601991 one i just like the competition and being in the elite level of something it just happens that its football two i think i can play here i dont like somebody else telling me im not good enough
601992 in the past when i havent played or been a backup ive always felt if i can keep improving thats all i can control
601993 tom brady was an even better player than i expected him to be
601994 competes every day at practice every day if he falls down he scrambles up and makes a play he plays the game just like he practices

602024 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends

602032 michele knows where all the bodies are buried not literally of course but what she knows is bad enough to bring heather down in flames
602033 i have two preschoolers ages 2 and 4 and this pool is just the right size for them
602034 it is the worst product id ever bought from toys r us and ill never go to six flags dont buy it
602035 one person cant slide down the slide while one person is in the pool let alone have 2 people sitting in it the slide is so small and when you turn on the hose to let the sprinklers come down the orange top collapses and has no use
602036 as every one else has said this pool is tiny maybe good for 1 or 2 toddlers picture on the front is not accurate a 6 year old cant go down the slide with his legs out because they hit the wall my 3 year old hardly fit buy a sprinkler for 5 00 my kids had more fun with that
602037 round the corner in the next bay twinkled the electricity of gytheion
602038 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
602039 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
602040 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
602041 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
602042 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
602043 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
602044 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
602045 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
602046 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
602047 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
602048 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
602049 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
602050 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
602051 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
602052 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
602053 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
602054 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
602055 when you find the same things it shows there is a pattern
602056 it shows there really havent been institutional things done to correct the problem
602057 it wouldnt be responsible to discuss these issues at this point in time
602058 that isnt to say the university wont get out without some punishment
602059 however our main concern is that they fix the problems and make it safer for the people in these buildings
602060 there are some wastes that could spend years in the open air and nothing would happen and they wouldnt pose any danger
602061 there are others that exposure to air could warm them enough to create an explosion
602062 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
602063 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
602064 at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt

602078 brands is a difficult track and its going to be hard to win here but i will be trying my best for sure
602079 we had some chatter problems yesterday and today and im not sure if the problem is worse here because of all the bumps
602080 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
602081 during the year 2000 at the time of the elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them

602083 regardless of what jersey im wearing its the same game ive played my entire life
602084 it was the last thing on my mind which is usually the case when you hit a home run
602085 its certainly great to see a ball leave the ballpark but he hasnt sold out his swing to home runs
602086 hes covering the plate and i think thats just a byproduct of a lot of good swings
602087 putting up nine will help though it gives somebody a little breathing room
602088 when he did throw strikes they werent at the right locations theres no doubt he struggled tonight
602089 a shame to miss out on q3 by one hundredth but we expected it to be tight we can be happy though especially given i only managed nine laps yesterday it means we did a good job today now we can do what we like in terms of fuel load for the race and hopefully find a good strategy ive yet to do a long run this weekend but i think we can find a good compromise between qualifying and race pace and we have a good set up on the car
602090 i struggled with the option tyre as it gave me no grip and i was sliding around more and had no feel for the car i was very happy in a well balanced car earlier on but after that im not really sure what happened i am disappointed because even if q3 would have been hard to reach i could not match my q1 time in q2
602091 i think we recovered well today from not having done enough running with vettel yesterday bourdais did a good job but did not get his last qualifying run quite right as unlike his team mate he was unable to take advantage of the extra grip from the options all in all i think we exploited the potential of our package and did a good job for vettel the one unknown tomorrow will be driving on a full tank as he has not had the chance to try it

602095 surjeet ji is not among us but his principles will always remain with us he was a great politician who has done a lot for the country
602096 we hope that we can continue to work for the development of the country along with those who believe in his thoughts
602097 comrade surjeet was a great freedom fighter and a great advocate of secularism
602098 we cannot miss this opportunity to get a real energy strategy for the united states
602099 its impacting people its on the top of the agenda i think what happens in the next few years will be very important
602100 were at the point now where with geopolitical disruptions those supply and demand lines sometimes cross
602101 thats what drives prices its just a plain and simple supply and demand market equation
602102 thats the type of thing that will get more production
602103 it can be done in a way that does protect the environment
602104 industry needs to do a better job of helping people understand that they dont need to be worried
602105 if the market suddenly came to the conclusion that the u s is changing its policy you might see impacts on the futures market fairly quickly
602106 we see the full suite of alternative energies being a big part of the future
602107 as world demand continues to rise theres a case that can be made that says even with all those alternative fuels we still cant keep up
602108 these alternatives generate electricity they will have no impact on the gasoline market because we dont have electric cars
602109 weve chosen to be here and develop a workforce here people said we wouldnt be able to get the people here but we have
602110 will the companys presence attract another big company probably not
602111 its in shells interest to keep the geophysicists and geologists close to the territory they know best
602112 to take one of these guys out of louisiana and plunk them down in colorado
602113 we have a tremendous wealth of experience and ability in this state
602114 there are supply companies and service companies that can be a major asset for companies working in the gulf the infrastructure is here the people are here
602115 houston has sort of evolved into this machine for doing the oil and gas business
602116 i think youll continue to see some back and forth between here and houston
602117 weve found it to be an advantage because we look different than other energy companies
602118 the government needs to do something about this now they have a responsibility to pensioners and to poorer families
602119 the energy companies are making huge profits and their executives are making millions in bonuses i think people will end up not having much of a life at all its almost like going back to victorian times
602120 i will have to put my rates up again if this trend continues and i am sure that will mean some people will drop out they just wont bother
602121 for the first time since the act of union was passed it can now be credibly argued that scotlands economic advantage lies in its repeal
602122 we think there should be a tiered system for these payments so that the further north you go the higher the sums
602123 that would compensate people for the longer heating season as well as the colder temperatures its definitely something that should be picked up in light of the recent energy price hikes
602124 consideration should be given to establishing a form of regional weighting that would recognise the increased burden in fuel costs to colder parts of the uk
602125 the winter fuel payment is a national scheme available to most people aged 60 or over and the amounts paid from it are the same throughout great britain it would add complexity and expense to take account of regional differences in temperatures given variations between areas of the uk are not extreme
602126 regulators such as ofgem have allowed energy prices to soar its virtually a cartel now yet in every state in america they regulate domestic fuel prices
602127 i want to see a windfall tax on the massive profits being made by the oil companies and bring the fuel prices down i would regulate domestic fuel prices again i would govern were letting regulators run the world we have got to get back to governing
602128 i hope there will be a windfall levy i hope that the uk takes that decision and uses that windfall for long term support for those in energy poverty i also hope that the winter fuel allowance will be part of the discussion
602129 both labour and snp ministers are toothless powerless and hopeless
602130 the energy market is not working there is a compelling case for referring the gas and electricity markets to the competition commission for inquiry
602131 high fuel prices are a fact of scottish life that means ministers in london and edinburgh must act both to protect the most vulnerable in the short term and to ensure we take the necessary steps towards creating a low carbon economy and society reducing our energy needs and generating from genuinely renewable sources is the only realistic long term solution
602132 we remain to be convinced that a windfall tax is the right approach we are looking at a variety of measures to help families cope with rising energy bills and to improve the energy efficiency of homes and businesses across the country
602133 they the bomb squad are investigating the office where the explosion occurred was not manned and so far there is no indication that anyone was injured
602134 there should be intense debate in the media around the issues contained on the mou
602135 the mou has been made public so as editors we believe it should be debated in public there should be frequent briefings on what is going on behind closed doors the public have a right to comment on it and on other issues
602136 the mdc believes that no amount of tinkering with currency denominations will address the zimbabwean crisis

602141 als liefde heb je een aantal daaraan verbonden rechten en aan die rechten zijn geen voorwaarden verbonden zo kan bijvoorbeeld niemand verhinderen dat je liefhebt dus ben je waar het liefde betreft altijd vrij liefde resoneert met het leven en met gezondheid door lief te hebben blijft je heelheid intact alle externe werkelijkheden en de producten daarvan zijn in zekere mate voorwaardelijk maar liefde behoort daar niet toe
602142 liefde is in de wereld maar niet van de wereld liefde is de meester van de voorwaarden niet de dienaar ervan dat betekent echter niet dat je daarom alle externe voorwaarden maar terzijde mag schuiven omdat in veel gevallen die voorwaarden de rechten en grenzen van andere inhouden er is echter een liefdescentrum in alle dingen het is je recht dat te weten en je met dat liefdescentrum te verbinden liefde is je broeder niet structuur je zult verrast zijn welke wonderen kunnen gebeuren als dit feit in je leven zijn plaats krijgt zelfs de storm heeft een liefdescentrum als je je verbindt met dat centrum heb je je broederschap gevestigd liefde zal liefde niet schaden daardoor kunnen de externe voorwaarden heronderhandeld worden en kan de storm gaan liggen of wegdraaien door dit te weten kun je de storm kalmeren of ten minste er in vrede samen mee zijn soms is een storm nodig maar door de macht van liefde wordt je niet geschaad
602143 als je de zekerheid hebt dat liefde het kernwezen van alles vormt dan is het net zo gemakkelijk als een ijsje eten
602144 myspace will be allowing users to dynamically share the content and data of their choosing including 1 publicly available basic profile information 2 myspace photos 3 myspacetv videos and 4 friend networks integration of the data availability project will roll to myspace users and participating websites in the coming weeks
602145 this project is open to any site out there that wants to work with us so were happy to work with facebook if they want to join up with us on this project
602146 for people who love learning and sharing knowledge with others
602147 at a preview of his new change congress project at the etech conference the creative commons founder responded to a question about the us pirate party saying
602148 call your party the pirate party and youll reinforce that the branding is not one that i would embrace here in the united states
602149 as a professor he should know better than to advocate judging a book by its cover
602150 its also unusual that the man that fought hollywoods increase of copyright should find fault with a party that only seeks to represent the general public and what better title than the name that hollywood is using for all citizens
602151 if you earn 100k while working you will need at least 80k in retirement
602152 gee i wish i had spent more of that money
602153 classic wisdom hasnt been serving investors that well lately for example as stocks struggle a number of prominent believers in index funds from suze orman to burton malkiel have begun to publicly question their former faith
602154 as far as whether you should adjust your portfolio allocations and put money where things are doing well thats the mistake most investors make so over time as conditions change you might very well change your allocation i would put much more in emerging markets today than i would have 30 years ago ive become a bit more positive on commodities this is probably a change in my thinking over the years
602155 he was complicated because we did not know the injuries internal that it had the patient and the vibrations of the segueta tool to cut trees or wooden or other material could make worse his health
602156 what is your name how old are you where do you live what is the day today to confirm that their answers were prudent
602157 about 15 minutes after receiving we transferred it to the operating room where a multidisciplinary team of specialistic and surgeons took part general it during six hours
602158 i sat next to the motorist the bus was cruising normally and suddenly the tree fell to us above the glass pieces caused wounds in my face but they are not serious
602159 notamos que una rama grande sal a de la cabina del conductor pero no sospech bamos que estaba introducida en su abdomen cuando nos acercamos y vimos el estremecedor cuadro decidimos pedir apoyo a los vecinos con equipo para cortar parte de la rama
602160 fue complicado porque no sab amos las lesiones internas que ten a el paciente y las vibraciones de la segueta pod an empeorar su salud todo se hizo con mucha paciencia
602161 cu l es su nombre qu edad tiene d nde vive qu d a es hoy para confirmar que sus respuestas fueran cuerdas
602162 unos 15 minutos despu s de recibirlo lo trasladamos al quir fano donde un equipo multidisciplinario de cirujanos especialistas y generales lo intervinieron durante unas seis horas milagrosamente la rama no caus da os a ning n rgano interno s lo al tejido blando grasa y piel sin embargo s rompi la cresta iliaca superior que es un hueso de la pelvis pero los cirujanos ortopedas lo operaron y por los momentos el paciente se encuentra estable pero bajo estricta vigilancia
602163 este caso es para ripley uno en 100 mil o quiz m s que atendemos en esta emergencia por a o
602164 yo ven a sentada adelante a la par del motorista el bus iba pasando y de repente nos cay el rbol encima los trozos de vidrio me causaron heridas en la cara pero no son graves

602166 help me pick out clothes based on the style of clothes i wear
602167 non sai quanto mi piacerebbe ucciderti ma sono felice che lei stia al caldo
602168 bella arriverei ad odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male
602169 were hoping it doesnt happen but in the back of your mind you know its a possibility
602170 so when it happens then guys will just have to step up we brought in keary colbert and d jack darrell jackson for a reason theyre proven players in this league so well all have to step up and fill his void
602171 it was a tough time with a lot of hatred but i was just glad to get into the service
602172 i figured if i was going to spend a lot of time with george i better start fishing
602173 what smith did was wrong and we take very serious and he is being punished severely for it
602174 he knows what those are and we will move forward
602175 i hope we have something resolved by monday i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
602176 when theres a lot you dont know its hard to use your full ability when you have to think about so many things
602177 i dont know if settled in is the right word
602178 last year we had young guys like me playing as freshmen
602179 cody shows a great deal of leadership in every aspect of the game and our team
602180 i dont want to say the difference between this year and last year will be familiarity but theres familiarity and a little more experience and confidence
602181 the guys at missouri had the team bonding thing down
602182 im sure that team already is buying into that whole thing our teams chemistry is building up very well
602183 its not an individual game there is an understanding that usually just comes with being older
602184 they threw us into the pool and told us to swim
602185 hopefully he and darrell get together and learn that offense i feel like there will be big things between the two of them along with returning sophomore demetrius sumler
602186 with those threats it will open up the passing game a lot more people will put more in the box and there will be less stress on me at wideout because of their ability
602187 theres an understanding between me and darrell same since junior year in high school
602188 i always felt hes the thunder and im the lightning hes pretty much the guy and im there to help him in the clutch
602189 call us a multiple offense that still believes in a physical run game to build everything else around
602190 we have three or four good running backs i think well do a lot of play action
602191 right now tight end kory sperry and our running backs are the offensive playmakers
602192 were waiting for that to happen weve got some talent were going to add to that significantly in august they still have to go out and make plays until we trust them to do it in a game
602193 im really excited to see them once we get pads on
602194 theres a lot of overall team excitement between the new guys coming in and the old guys
602195 i dont think the coaches are going to have any favorites
602196 sometimes i think i may be more popular in china and asia than in the united states
602197 and in some ways basketball here may be bigger than in the states
602198 the opportunity for basketball and the nba in china is simply extraordinary
602199 the first time i went to the philippines my rookie year the plane arrived at 2 30 in the morning
602200 i looked at a court outside and it was packed there were about 60 people playing and it was raining
602201 all the jerseys are kobe lebron james and yao now theyre wearing celtics jerseys why because thats the team that won the championship
602202 people here work so hard they dont have that commitment to get better its more whatever you can whenever you can
602203 companies have teams but its really just a reason to get people together
602204 the law firms the bankers a lot of them are europeans who come out here without knowing anyone so theyll put a team together just to create a sense of camaraderie or brotherhood so to speak
602205 we had some discussion about a larger tire several years ago with nascar when we started this whole discussion about the car of tomorrow
602206 but obviously weve been working with the current size on the car of tomorrow this spring we decided to ramp that new program up
602207 we are working on a larger contain air volume a bigger section width taller tire larger bead diameter
602208 right now its all modeling were trying to figure out what the right size would be
602209 i would love him to stay but every guy has to look out for himself
602210 that was the toughest day emotionally ive ever had in my whole life
602211 this is the first time in my life that im doing this and
602212 but that adds excitement and youthfulness that other countries dont have i think the one thing thats so great about the american team is we arent a cookie cutter team we all bring different things and we dont look alike you look at us out of the pool you wouldnt believe we match the way that we do we try to highlight peoples different strengths
602213 she knows how to use her body really well and is even lighter than she looks
602214 shes got a really good work ethic and great legs that may sound funny but in this sport aesthetics are a part of it
602215 i think bittersweet is the best way to describe it
602216 but shes definitely going to beijing to cheer me on its really hard obviously and there are a lot of emotions there but weve always supported each other
602217 give me a club and ill be in the hunt with eddie and freddie romero and funk
602218 its a good combination for south america for argentina as well and for me
602219 my game is very good they have to play very good to beat me
602220 now we have 350 children in our country playing golf and angel and i help them

602234 with an investigation under way i cannot answer any of the pressing questions or comment on speculations regarding the semgroup situation
602235 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organisation with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
602236 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organisation including having ties with israel
602237 the event in tibet this spring as well as protests regarding the torch relay was a worldwide negative campaign for the olympics in beijing
602238 so ive considered it and im convinced that we need to significantly upgrade our security program how would you propose we proceed to fill its leadership
602239 i anticipated your buy in and i think we should let marilyn svp human resources and bill chief information officer provide us with their rationale for having this responsibility in their portfolio they both have some real skin in this game
602240 ive already got too much on my plate with our international initiatives marilyn and bill are both on the executive committee and i think either of these elevate security closer to you and the board
602241 the board and the audit committee have made their concerns very clear on our current shortcomings with regard to a variety of security issues what we have to resolve between these two is whether this job is going to have real access and be more fundamental to our global risk management strategy or is it more of a day to day tactical job
602242 i agree based on our audit reports over the last several quarters coupled with our global initiatives theres just too much going on in the security related area of risk that we dont know and that makes me nervous lets get somebody in that job that can really scope out our security risks and get the business unit managers on board with solutions
602243 set up a meeting for you and me with these two and lets see who has the best vision for this function
602244 we are moving ahead with a more senior hire for corporate security we think this involves moving the current function out of facilities and into either of your portfolios to give it greater visibility and reach prepare your position descriptions and we will meet with the ceo late next week
602245 ive taken the liberty of asking our chief counsel to join us as i think there may be a number of issues of concern to him in this position marilyn why dont you start
602246 i see security as a support function to the business perhaps even decentralized across our business functions anyone who approaches this job as the be all and end all of security misses the point that every manager in this company has an obligation to protect our shareholders and our assets while its clear that this position requires a leader who understands risk i think a critical success factor will be in their ability as a relationship manager somebody who can build trust so that our business unit managers will come to him or her with their issues before they boil over at the end of the day that approach is at the core of hrs service focus
602247 i think marilyn is right about this position focusing in the business units our whole it strategy is built around the notion of us providing security policy that holds every employee accountable for protecting our infrastructure and our private data at the corporate level we provide the tools and the intellectual leadership to a cadre of trained information security specialists in every business function the same philosophy is applied in our business continuity program that resides in my office facilities already provides an in depth physical security program around our data centers and other critical spaces that it has mandated and much of our emphasis there has been in technology rather than guards it seems to me it would be relatively simple to add a few complimentary programs to what we already have and limit our costs
602248 look at the expanded job description for a chief security officer that has emerged since 911 internal and external investigations threat analysis intelligence physical security personnel security information protection emergency preparedness and response management id add to that a global network of contacts a far more comprehensive background vetting program and significantly greater risk assessment around our expanding domestic and global business partners
602249 that sounds significantly broader than what each of you are talking about how would you approach these capabilities
602250 our hr employee relations team is highly competent in fact finding around allegations of misconduct and weve contracted for a confidential hotline to comply with new regulations moreover we have very few reported instances of internal misconduct i would assume we would continue to use outside contractors for fraud investigations we seem to be in line with our peers on just vetting a select few in management and risk prone positions
602251 marilyn you are the employees advocate and bill your people are highly limited in non technical or operational security issues it doesnt seem to me that either of your teams is trained to comprehensively probe suspected instances of employee fraud or trade secret theft these have potentially serious consequences for the company
602252 with all respect having hr responsible for background and internal investigations presents a potential conflict of interest in my view we are increasingly empowering a broader and deeper base of employees and contractors with sensitive logical and physical access i think expanding both our background vetting and security related due diligence makes a lot of sense id look for a highly qualified security generalist to manage much of the work counsel has outlined a properly staffed security team backed by a clear set of policy expectations and a mandate to work collaboratively with their hr and business colleagues and business managers is the course id take in this initiative
602253 bill has mentioned policy twice the culture we have here does not respond well to policies and an appearance of a control centered enforcement philosophy it is wholly focused on technical risk and many of the issues counsel refers to are human threats which require a totally different mind set on internal controls he speaks of a concern for having certain security programs in hr while at the same time his ciso lives within the it department i do agree with bill on hiring a highly qualified security generalist but id focus the search on someone with several years of corporate experience rather than the law enforcement backgrounds that seem to be prevalent in the field finally i think its important to note hrs record on the application of best practices id bring that sort of leadership to the development of best practices in security risk management
602254 you both seem to feel that this is a take it or leave it choice that somehow your leadership and unique environments will result in a better security program fair enough both hr and it bring assets and liabilities to the table but im concerned that neither of you have spoken about the range of threats confronting the company as we adapt to our markets and competition what sort of security leadership competencies and experience will add value in those critical areas
602255 i share our ceos concerns i think it underscores the need for this individuals ability to connect the dots to see across the interdependencies and seek out the weaknesses in our internal controls many of those controls are either owned or heavily influenced by your organizations
602256 as we have gone around the table i have to admit that im coming to the conclusion that this function should be independent what about you marilyn
602257 id share that with the assurance that this job be filled by a proven professional who can develop respect for the function and influence our managers on stewardship and commitment to doing the right thing
602258 id echo that with the suggestion that we form some sort of multi disciplinary security committee chaired by security it seems to me that this would provide some assurance that we are all working on the same agenda with regard to risk management
602259 i agree i would also add that we need to bring facilities into the solution inasmuch as the physical security elements are key to an integrated corporate security program i think we all accept the need for a chief security officer position the question on the table now is to whom should this cso position report

602268 our study shows for the first time the surprising speed with which humans make body fat from fructose
602269 the goal was not to test the effects of high fructose corn syrup
602270 fructose gets made into fat more quickly and when that process is turned on there seems to be a signal that goes to the liver that says store all the other fats you are seeing
602271 the health benefits of eating fruit far outweigh the slight increase in fat production that might occur as the result of eating something with fructose in it
602272 by comparison a cup of strawberries has 4 grams of fructose and an apple has about 11
602273 like sugar honey and some fruit juices high fructose corn syrup contains almost equal portions of fructose and glucose glucose has been shown to have a tempering effect on specific metabolic effects of fructose
602274 new research continues to confirm that high fructose corn syrup is no different from other sweeteners it has the same number of calories as sugar and is handled similarly by the body
602275 ive never had a client who has become overweight eating too much fruit or too many vegetables but i have had plenty who ate too many foods with added sugar and fat

602321 yeah so we were digging around in the dirt on mars looking for water and um we dug up a couple worms
602322 worms you called a press conference because you dug up a worm
602323 sweety these are worms living on mars we just discovered life on another planet in our solar system all your bases are belong to us that sort of thing
602324 so why is there all this secrecy according to scientists in communication with aviation week amp space technology the next big discovery will need to be mulled over for a while before it is announced to the world

602326 hmmm dats very inter resting how come they didnt find water during the apollo missions
602327 the moon damn i thought that was mars crap i announced the wrong mission
602328 nasa has lost focus and is no longer associated with inspiration

602337 heard about the recent news reports implying i may have found martian life those reports are incorrect
602338 reports claiming there was a white house briefing are also untrue and incorrect
602339 your hyperbole example of perceived stupidity of our republican president looks a bit moronic considering the reality of this democratic house representative
602340 the viking probes of the mid 1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in martian soil at their respective landing sites and had some apparently positive results including a temporary increase of co2 production on exposure to water and nutrients however this sign of life was later disputed by many scientists resulting in a continuing debate with nasa scientist gilbert levin asserting that viking may have found life a re analysis of the now 30 year old viking data in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life has suggested that the viking tests were also not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life the tests may even have killed a hypothetical life form

602342 though they were okay with the product and thought it was a decent enough follow up to sarkar theres little chance of another sequel any more the bachchans professional relationship with ramu has run its course
602343 after sarkar raj ramu released contract everyone knows its content and box office performance in fact all of ramus films in the last two years barring sarkar raj have been miserable flops friends and even mrs bachchan was totally against nishabd and its shocking theme when the film was released the bachchanss worst fears came true
602344 therere too many financial liabilities riding on ramus company and the bachchans are not foolish to let any filmmaker exploit their name and presence to override those liabilities they are extremely wary now
602345 i dont know where you get these ridiculous stories from why would that be and what is your source
602346 weve just completed the first leg of the tour now we leave for houston for the next leg its been completely overwhelming seeing this adulation from fans all over the world ive come close to being mobbed
602347 on the website the trailers to drona have generated serious interest the response has been fantastic
602348 with my dad working is always fun but i enjoyed myself with my mom too
602349 when he was still a long way off his father saw him
602350 its unique enough that i dont think theres a standard operating procedure for handling it
602351 tom and i have talked it over quite a bit but we knew all along that its going to have to be a very fluid project
602352 with this many guys there are going to be a lot of individual ups and downs one day one of them is going to look better than the rest the next day itll be someone else its going to take some patience from us
602353 who plays how much and when wednesday will have to depend on how everyone looks in the practices leading up to the scrimmage
602354 all of them reported in very good condition it was clear during the first practice that theyd all done their offseason work
602355 the pieces are in place for our offense and that includes quarterback
602356 we may not know which one is going to be the starter yet but everyone on the team knows what those guys can do the quarterback position wont be a problem for us
602357 we want his contract to reward the impact he has had on our athletic revenue streams but he is almost as important to the whole greenville community said holland citing the coachs fundraising efforts especially the drew steele skip holtz project that has generated more than 500 000 for special olympics training facilities
602358 skip has shown more interest in the contracts of his assistant coaches than he has his own and that is why he has been able to assemble a first rate staff
602359 i love it here my wife loves it my kids love it
602360 my job is to continue to build a winner and contend year in and year out for a conference championship
602361 but overall im extremely encouraged said holtz whose passion permeated throughout the murphy center banquet room and also appeared to rev up his players
602362 he takes good care of the ball knows when to throw it away and provides tremendous leadership
602363 our big question is how to replace that many players on that side of the ball
602364 the addition of jake cabell as defensive coordinator will make a big difference he has a wealth of experience and we feel really good about his defensive scheme
602365 weve got a little more confidence knowing how the guys around us are going to perform
602366 theres a little swagger we have weve done this before
602367 ive been doing it long enough to know that if you get caught up in all the hoopla and all the pie in the sky and all the pats on the back youre not going to be very good
602368 you kind of pick the paper up hey were in the top 25
602369 the rankings in december are what matter not the rankings in august
602370 but its really cool to know people have expectations for us were really excited to get this season started
602371 we really cant focus on the hype because we havent played one single game
602372 everybodys out here telling us how great were going to be

602375 its not going to be easy for ronaldo to come to madrid but we will have to see
602376 do i still want to sign ronaldo what a question of course i do if you ask any coach that question then every single one of them would want ronaldo he is a great player one of the best
602377 if i were to make a recommendation i would recommend that we not change it
602378 i dont think that the economic damage according to the law that allows a change is there
602379 the weather was in our favor last night but the wind flared up again this morning despite this we will have the fire totally under control today
602380 we had an awesome dodge charger back in june here at pocono
602381 i hope that we can run well again this weekend its going to be a real battle to make it in the chase these next six races so its real important to run consistent and stay up front
602382 thats the main goal thats what all the teams want to do for their sponsors and owners and the employees that work on these cars
602383 out of the 14 drivers going for the chase i think that we have as good a shot as anyone from sixth on back
602384 we have some different people in place at gillett evernham motorsports and we have a better starting point this year
602385 i think we have a great test team that does a lot for our team now i feel that everything that they work on is much better than last year
602386 right handed power pitchers have been particularly tough on us this year
602387 we have to step it up because there are a lot of them in the american league
602388 they did a great job of professional hitting against felix
602389 they took pitches that just missed and they fouled a lot of his better pitches off they forced him to throw a lot of pitches
602390 after that first inning i thought wed be lucky to get five innings from felix in todays game when your pitcher throws 110 pitches thats enough felix threw more in five innings than guthrie did in nine
602391 the last four games ive walked too many guys thrown too many balls
602392 ive got to get quicker outs i was kind of wild tonight but they fouled off a lot of pitches
602393 making it to state is a big deal because there arent many divisions
602394 this is a great positive community event to bring a regional event to a city is a pretty special thing and the athletes love it they all have a great time out here
602395 i do it for something to do in the summer
602396 it goes to show that no matter your intellectual disability theres something for you
602397 some of these players get excited when these times of the year roll around its something they can be proud of and they can say theyve accomplished usually these types of athletes never get the spotlight

602423 most people have no idea of the abortifacient nature of the birth control pill
602424 birth control and abortifacients begins with a detailed analysis of the various standard methods of contraception noting their abortifacient action and harmful side effects on women
602425 as an egg is microscopic it can be difficult to tell in any given case whether an egg really has been released but dutch gynecologist dr nine van der vange made an extensive study of women using these pills she found proof that an egg had been released in 4 of the cases and found follicle growth typical of what one finds in early pregnancy in at least 52 of cases
602426 most people have no idea of the abortifacient nature of the birth control pill
602427 the crux of the matter is that it has been said that birth control pills usually act by contraception that any abortions that result should be accepted as an unfortunate accident this is a little like saying that its alright to fire a gun randomly in the dark as you usually wont hit anybody and in the few cases when you do it should be accepted as an unfortunate accident
602428 according to the director of planned parenthood of england the birth control pill causes 150 different chemical changes in a womans body not one of these is beneficial
602429 other side effects of birth control pills are the development of high blood pressure blood clots stroke heart attack depression weight gain migraine dark spots on the skin and difficulty with breastfeeding
602430 one reason condoms fail in preventing the transfer of aids is that latex condoms have tiny intrinsic holes called voids sperm is larger than the holes but the aids virus is 50 times smaller than these tiny holes which makes it easy for the virus to pass through
602431 to give you an idea of how easy it would be for the virus to pass through these holes just imagine a ping pong ball going through a basketball hoop
602432 based on direct observations of various signs that occur in a womans body changes in the cervix cervical mucus and temperature which tell her when ovulation occurs
602433 heres the difference between artificial birth control and nfp in the first case one does something takes a pill uses a condom etc to deliberately close the life giving power of sexual intercourse
602434 in nfp however no such step is taken the spouses do not act against their fertility they do not reject the link between the two meanings of sex love and life they simply follow the natural patterns of the bodys fertility and infertility patterns placed there by god himself
602435 since the spouses can ignore worries about contraceptive failure or side effects of the pill
602436 the poorer areas particularly in the south are producing alarmingly more than their share of future generations

602442 hello gary i really enjoyed the article about blackberries i love them so much i have a lot of them on my place too but the best thing about them they saved my little brothers life he had some sort of flu could not keep anything down or it went straight through him the doctors could not help him but my seminole great grandmother told my mother to give him blackberry juice we started this an almost instantly he started getting better and it wasnt long before he was strong again i have to laugh at my purple fingers during blackberry season but there is nothing better it is one of my nature connections even my dog picks berries with me but the thorns give her a hard time because they get her on the nose thanks for the blackberry article and all that you do
602443 native to europe blackberries are harvested in late spring and early summer from april through july but are out of season in the winter and are too cool for most winter climates they are sweet sour and astringent and help cool the body down and to treat diarrhoea a classic summer condition in which the stool is liquefied by excess heat
602444 blackberries freeze well too so you can have them all year our labrador loves them as well im currently reading james howard kunstlers geography of nowhere his ideas go well with yours about living within your means seasonality human sized oriented projects you can pick up used copies in the us very cheaply he too sees the future by examining what has come before
602445 hello again my grandmother used to serve blackberry juice when i was a little child she called it blackberry acid its the only time i have ever seen it served in this country
602446 i once had the opportunity to read an unpublished civil war journal kept by the lady of a plantation in eastern nc while all her men were away in the war the entry one day was put up fifty gallons of blackberry wine thats a lot of production from wild blackberries the berries are indeed really good here this year as is almost all the other fruit wild or domestic enjoy
602447 modern science has confirmed that dark colored berries and red purple and dark blue grapes are a treasure house of health giving and possibly even life extending phenolic compounds including proanthocyanidins anthocyanins and quercetin and while the days of home made wine may be over we now have excellent extracts that provide standardized doses of the active polyphenols in berries and grapes bilberry extract and grape seed extract are the best known cranberry extract and elderberry extract are also available for special therapeutic uses
602448 your article on blackberries blueberries is good however you would have to consume a huge amt of berries to get the daily req of orac of 10 000 15 000 and would be really expensive
602449 dear gary to begin with the fda recommended daily orac intake is 3000 5000 the remarks assume that the only anti oxidants that you will take in would be blackberry blueberry
602450 the orac has become a marketing tool but it has its foibles it is not the
602451 i think that there would be additional anti oxidant power by adding a berry
602452 there already exists chocolates with berry etc added bottom line is that the product is probably good wonder how it tastes fresh is always better to my mind you lose some anti oxidant strength with processing you do keep the color chemical component anthrocyanidins
602453 fresh blueberries have high orac value oxygen radical absorbance capacity
602454 floridas economy has been underperforming the u s economy for the past year
602455 underperforming the nation is something floridians are not really used to
602456 the sunshine state still remains an attractive place to do business but has clearly lost some of its luster in recent years various rankings of competitiveness show florida slipping relative to texas north carolina and georgia
602457 every girl needs a pair of flat knee high boots this fall
602458 the barbarous custom of having men beaten who are suspected of having important secrets to reveal must be abolished it has always been recognized that this way of interrogating men by putting them to torture produces nothing worthwhile
602459 there are but two powers in the world the sword and the mind in the long run the sword is always beaten by the mind
602460 i think most everything is mastered a little too loud
602461 god is in the details but there are no details anymore
602462 have sound all over them theres no definition of nothing no vocal no nothing just like static
602463 we were hearing instruments youve never heard on that album like finger cymbals and the sound of viola strings being plucked
602464 it blew me away because it was exactly what he heard in the studio
602465 you can hear the distinct instruments and the sound of the room
602466 you lose the power of the chorus because its not louder than the verses
602467 the excitement in music comes from variation in rhythm timbre pitch and loudness
602468 if you hold one of those constant it can seem monotonous
602469 if you limit range its just an assault on the body
602470 when youre fifteen its the greatest thing youre being hammered but do you want that on a whole album
602471 when people have the courage and the vision to do a record that way it sets them apart
602472 it sounds warm it sounds three dimensional it sounds different analog sound to me is more emotionally affecting
602473 in the seventies and eighties you were expected to pay attention
602474 its a style that started post grunge to get that intensity the idea was to slam someones face against the wall you can set your cd to stun
602475 but people can play it in the car and its competitive with the new foo fighters record
602476 you dont get the punch anymore it decreases the punch of the kick drum and how the speaker gets pushed when the guitarist plays a power chord
602477 its like going to the louvre and instead of the mona lisa theres a 10 megapixel image of it
602478 i always want to listen to music the way the artists wanted me to hear it i wouldnt look at a kandinsky painting with sunglasses on
602479 you have to be aware of how people will hear music and pretty much everyone is listening to mp3
602480 some of the effects get lost so you sometimes have to over exaggerate things
602481 but the problem is that you have something thats professional but its not distinctive i was talking to a session drummer and i said whens the last time you could tell who the drummer is you can tell keith moon or john bonham but now they all sound the same
602482 i think youll be able to imagine many things senator mccain will be able to say
602483 hes never been the president but he will put forth his lifetime of experience i will put forth my lifetime of experience
602484 hey look even hillary would vote for me so why shouldnt you
602485 man youre either in or your out we have no time for spectators
602486 mr no flow 100 words per minute everything is a conspiracy droppin the n bomb every 2 seconds
602487 thats why white people think were all fill in the blank
602488 have you seen my hat of course he wanted it its got cherries
602489 they often cited suka sama suka meaning they believed it was consensual sex
602490 some believe rape is where force was used so having sex with the victim isnt rape to them they are ignorant that rape is also caused by persuasion coercion manipulation and relationship power between an older person and a young victim
602491 even so i could not help feeling heated during one interview i raised my voice at a
602492 it was hardest to speak to people who had abused their positions of power like a religious head who raped the teenage girls volunteering to serve in the temple under the full trust of their parents
602493 a music composer convicted of statutory rape against his teenaged stepdaughter passionately declared i am a lover not a killer
602494 but for the record hindi talaga ako kasali sa bench fashion show bago man ito naplano wala talaga ako sa show also that day july 25 i was doing a commercial shoot so there is no chance for me to do the show

602496 but for the record hindi talaga ako kasali sa bench fashion show bago man ito naplano wala talaga ako sa show also that day july 25 i was doing a commercial shoot so there is no chance for me to do the show
602497 nothing against anyone or what its all about its just something i just dont wanna do
602498 i know nothing about that as far as i am concerned from the very start ive decided not to join the fashion show not for anything else it was my personal decision not to join long before they planned or they did the sequencing so wala po talaga ako sa show

602580 that was a very good qualifying session for me and im obviously delighted
602581 but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5 we are in a great situation for tomorrow its good for all of us and after hockenheim this is the perfect answer for the faith i have in the whole team
602582 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing
602583 im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us to score as many points as possible for the constructors championship overtaking is very difficult here but tomorrow is a very long race and we will see what we can achieve
602584 from the pit wall that was a very exciting and pleasing hour of qualifying
602585 well have to see what the fuel loads are tomorrow but when all the cars were at low fuel he was consistently in the top three jarno struggled for balance so we will look into the data tonight the tyres were a very close call today but we organised our run plan so that we were able to make the right decisions at the right time and it worked out now we have a strong position for the race tomorrow with both drivers
602586 now therefore give me this mountain of which the lord spoke in that day for you heard in that day how the anakim were there and that the cities were great and fortified it may be that the lord will be with me and i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said

602622 last thanksgiving these young girls crashed into her house she was in a chair in her bedroom watching tv and the crash pinned her against the wall
602623 the doctors cant really say if the crashed caused it but i believe it did she had been very independent
602624 she was always there for me she was very unselfish
602625 she loved to garden roses were her favorite but she could grow just about anything
602626 shed putter around the yard she had a lot of patience
602627 there was a yellow rose bush that grew under my window while i was growing up im going to dig it up and take it to my house itll be my way of keeping my mom

602640 but i want them to have the level of engagement and excitement they would have had for a hillary clinton ticket
602641 if obama doesnt take hillary theyre going to skip that race on the ballot
602642 hillary is really going to have to say something and shes really going to have to campaign for him
602643 we pray to saints and ask the virgen virgin mary to intercede on our behalf
602644 if hillary does that on a political level for obama it could make a huge difference
602645 maybe not as running mate but obama still needs clinton

602649 the lord blessed me to go forward in marriage july 27 2006 the day after i turned 15 years old

602657 i think the leadership of baptist deserves kudos for seeing this as a problem and moving forward to fix it
602658 weve got to get this in place and it doesnt matter if its at baptist or at methodist or where it is
602659 i want something in place so no one else has to experience this hell
602660 i think its a very positive very strong step by the baptist health system and i think thats a very good thing for san antonio
602661 were the ones that deal with the patients when they arrive at the hospital
602662 were the ones that deal with their families and if theres no infrastructure available as in the past with neurologists and neurosurgeons were the ones left on the hook with the patients trying to do the best job we can do
602663 for baptist to come through and organize this its tremendous for us
602664 all weve been saying for four years is that hes owed a hearing to have his case reviewed
602665 i dont hate him but i want justice for my little girl

602676 i wanted to make it badly in the individual race but it didnt work out
602677 but its another opportunity to get a medal and a medal is a medal
602678 playing for your national team in such a meaningful and great environment is always a great experience
602679 if they keep getting better and they can get a third fencer for the team they could be a threat for the team prize
602680 so that would be very exciting of course its exciting to go to the olympics but to go and have a victory then that would truly be a topping on the cake
602681 right now im more relaxed than i was in 04 and going through everything in the past four years has helped me prepare better for these games
602682 im surprised by the strength in some of the events
602683 weve obviously again demonstrated why we have trials and why we pick our team in trial by fire here on the track because we get some people who may not have been on anybodys list to make the team
602684 the country has 1 3 billion people and they have used large amounts of resources in their sports programs
602685 one of the most eagerly anticipated games in olympic history
602686 we dont want the first time a medic sees blood to be in iraq or afghanistan
602687 i know that some think that what were doing is horrible but ive been there and ive seen people dying
602688 its a very sensitive issue and we certainly realize that
602689 we dont want to distract them but the primary focus of that is to train our soldiers because we firmly believe that the training we are giving these soldiers which includes all kinds of training culminating with live tissue training helps saves lives on the battlefield
602690 it isnt right to use another being in this way any more than we would choose to use a human being from another country
602691 we dont experiment on other people and we should extend that same consideration to other species
602692 the reason is simply because they like us can feel pain can enjoy life share many of the same qualities of the enjoyment of life that human beings have and they arent things they arent objects and we should not treat them as if they were
602693 opposed to everything we do in animals science and training
602694 i believe anyone would rather have a doctor a surgeon or a medic do a procedure on animals first before they do it on a human in the same situation
602695 if somebody walked the halls of brooke army medical center and looked into the eyes of the soldiers that are over there missing limbs or pieces of their body and then asked them do you think if its beneficial if the medic that took care of you went through a live tissue lab so he could understand your circulatory system
602696 do you think he should just do that on a mannequin and i think he needs to do whatever it is to save me or my buddys life
602697 you can tell by looking at this guy that he was a nonsmoker
602698 i think it just points out the problems with our tree ordinance
602699 and we either bite the bullet and make it a tree ordinance that is meaningful or we continue to lose trees and our future viability as a city
602700 we had a press conference complaining about this very issue
602701 but i will tell you i will support the position of the city of san antonio and the city attorneys office and if someone is not following the rules of the tree ordinance or even within the spirit of the language of the law im going to go on the side of protecting our community against developers developers shouldnt do this stuff
602702 those properties are under agricultural exemptions which preempts local law so all ranchers and farmers in the state of texas for obvious reasons are allowed to remove trees thats kind of the bottom line
602703 no developments been done on that property in the history of man
602704 designated for retail corporate campus back office sites high density housing mixed use etc
602705 it is the citys intention to make violations to the tree preservation ordinance a serious matter
602706 as the city is well aware the property has been used for agricultural purposes for many years
602707 please be advised that any removal of vegetation on all or a portion of the property was conducted as part of an agricultural operation
602708 what we were trying to do was see if there were any permits out there that would void the ag exemption
602709 reserves the right to pursue any and all enforcement actions should additional facts come to our attention that warrant such actions
602710 i hear what youre asking and youre asking valid questions
602711 we need to make sure as a community that we are above reproach that we treat everybody fairly and equitably and we promote responsible growth and development and i wanna tell you i dont care whos developing the land we have to protect this community against massive tree cutting
602712 if the letter shouldnt have been written i wouldnt have written it
602713 i think if i asked michael bernard to write a letter that he didnt believe was in the best interest of the city of san antonio he wouldnt do it
602714 theres nothing to be sorry about oconlin you did good
602715 but we gotta get outta here blew up the place dont know how long
602716 john get your sister out of the car while i try to put out the fire
602717 youll be out of school for the next couple of weeks and so will john
602718 mom i cant miss school you said it yourself that absence is what gets you on the radar
602719 too bad because youre not going at least not without her
602720 i said no john and thats final now how can we fix you up
602721 i think the explosion must have scrambled your cpu you registered that
602722 now i remember you sense injuries so it makes sense that you sense touch too
602723 and were you planning on telling me that you have this ability
602724 sorry about my mom when things like this happen she can get a little
602725 tyler jess devlin lieutenant general of techcom leader of the division intellitech j s 4 9 7 2 8 born on february 17th 1991 he grew up in century city attended campo de cahuenga high school imprisoned at century in 2015 2019 from 2021 to 2022 and in 2024 served under john connor from 2021 reached the rank of lieutenant general in 2025 sole survivor of the siege of intellitech base in december 2025 third in command of tech com hes johns best programmer operational as jester and devil
602726 you said he attended the high school youre attending now
602727 a loner with quite a few bats in his belfry hes the one who convinced you that those tin cans could actually serve the resistance always tinkering with those metalheads in his downtime withdrawn secretive and yet the men and women who served and survived under him think the world of him
602728 a group of computer geeks with an obsession for the very machines that are trying to kill them
602729 intellitech was founded in 2018 as an answer to skynets when in 2021 the human resistance better known as tech com was founded john connor and tj devlin joined forces and intellitech became a division of tech com
602730 you spoke of a siege and that hes a sole survivor
602731 the fall of it was the result of one mans betrayal
602732 lieutenant general devlin had nothing to gain with the fall of itbase and everything to lose
602733 i dont have any detailed files on itbase and the siege only what john told me
602734 no thats tactically dangerous he will find us if he wants to we need to leave
602735 tin cans like yourself would like to stay away from him as far as possible
602736 no but the very fact he exists messes with your programming right
602737 i have no recollection of it but i am not afraid of him
602738 not only is the devil johns best programmer hes also a terminator terminator
602739 he absolutely does not fear the machine attacking them unarmed is a sport for him theres nothing that man doesnt know about those metal bastards
602740 he reprogrammed me together with john for that i cannot be scared of him
602741 what do you know about this devlin aside from the obvious statistics
602742 it means that he had a sweetheart but no one knew who
602743 only devlin his troops and john knew which lead to numerous rumors about his or her identity
602744 why were the other troops not allowed to go to itbase and hang out with them why was everything so hush hush they had someone cooped up with them there and the rest wasnt allowed to know about it
602745 youre asking me for answers about things i have done that i still will have to do
602746 could you at least try and stay in your own lane mom
602747 i know you have had a mission priority change darlin
602748 ah its retreat too bad cause it aint gonna happen
602749 wouldnt you be dont you wonder how many more have you sent back from the future to keep us safe
602750 i dont know why i keep sending back those poor souls with everything that we have changed in this time youd think wed put a stop to it but they keep coming and i keep sending back these soldiers to protect us kyle uncle bob cameron derek and his crew and now this devlin guy will it never end
602751 now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went home
602752 so he himself often withdrew into the wilderness and prayed
602753 now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went home

602756 in athens it was just about participating but since then ive taken part in other international competitions ive accumulated experience although i now have some other pressure that i didnt feel in athens
602757 but i would like to turn that pressure into power
602758 the food in the olympic village is very good i brought some food from japan just in case but i dont think ill need it
602759 its still very empty so we cant just cheat and eat at mcdonalds because everybody would notice
602760 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world
602761 a splendid performance at the olympics opening ceremony is of major importance
602762 however we dont exclude that on the 8th of august there might be periodic rain
602763 the council felt that with the presence of foreign players local players have not been given the opportunity
602764 we are back to the drawing board our focus now will be development
602765 we are not at the status of the english premier league our league is not matured yet therefore some drastic measures must be taken to improve it
602766 many are having problems paying salaries and they cant cope so it is best that we do away with foreign players until the problems are solved
602767 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
602768 more than 180 palestinians from fatah were authorised to take refuge in israel 22 of them were wounded and were hospitalised
602769 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose terrorism and who favour negotiations
602770 this is why we take this position when these palestinians are in distress and asking to go to abbass headquarters in ramallah where they will participate in the struggle against hamas
602771 if costs are rising here due to higher fuel prices and food prices are going up then our workers too should be entitled to what is deemed fit by the malaysian government
602772 we also want a system in place whereby if an employer accuses workers of any wrongdoing the issue will be handled with fairness
602773 the kind of car that all countries and car companies love now is the green car consumers will also be happy when they drive such a car knowing it saves fuel and does not pollute
602774 such an effort by proton will also assist the government in saving petrol and preserving the environment
602775 this is the final phase of an important project that would have not been possible without the cooperation of customers all summer long
602776 we have tried very hard to minimize the impact but on the august 23 24 weekend it is particularly important for lirr customers to be aware of whats happening we want everyone who plans to ride the railroad that weekend to be ready to adjust their travel plans accordingly
602777 this project will benefit our customers by providing a smoother and faster ride over the crossovers and a reduction in maintenance related track outages at a heavily traveled section of the railroad
602778 we are proud to be two years ahead of the schedule that we had set in 1994 to create 67 stations that are accessible to everyone said elliot g
602779 this is the third ribbon cutting ceremony that we have held in the last month it is a pleasure to be able to complete so many important projects thanks to the strong support of elected officials throughout the region
602780 we want to operate a first class subway system for everyone and each station that we are able to bring into compliance with the ada brings us closer to that goal
602781 from my initial days as president of nyc transit it has been one of my goals to make substantial improvements in system accessibility
602782 i look forward to the day when all 468 stations are ada compliant as that is something that should have been done by now
602783 michael has the experience and vision to lead the mta capital construction company at a time when the need for our transportation megaprojects is clear
602784 our blue ribbon panel on construction excellence looked at how to complete construction projects on time and within budget during a time of rising commodity prices local labor shortages and a weak dollar michaels extensive experience vision and innovative outlook will enable us to implement the ideas the panel generated he will take over from the very capable ronnie hakim who did a terrific job leading the agency through this period of transition
602785 i am pleased and honored to be joining the mta at a time when attention is focused more than ever on the importance of mass transit infrastructure
602786 challenging times will demand innovative solutions and i look forward to working with the excellent team at capital construction to get the job done
602787 the heads of state or governments stressed the urgent need to develop the regional hydro potential grid connectivity and gas pipelines
602788 give me another condom because my girlfriends sister is very cute too she always crosses her legs in a provocative manner when she sees me and i think she expects something from me too
602789 after all give me one more condom because my girlfriends mom is still pretty cute and when she sees me she always makes allusions and since she invited me for dinner i think she is expecting something from me
602790 dear lord bless this dinner thank you for all you give us

602799 from baghdad to america life lessons from a dog named lava
602800 there are no guarantees in any area of life in all my experiences there the pakistan people have been friendly and hospitable
602801 everything is absolutely first class all measures are taken with security they make a huge effort in the security stakes at no stage have i felt worried in danger or threatened in pakistan
602802 my brother was riding his bicycle and was chased by that stray dog he is dead scared of dogs and just climbed over someones wall to get away
602803 i figured hed get plunked for his little bat flip in his last at bat when he homered off of todd jones
602804 the health department came in and escorted me to jps and they confined me in a room
602805 theres the typical stuff racism low education and poverty that makes them vulnerable
602806 but really what is happening doesnt have anything to do with race
602807 were trying to teach them that their needs are just as important as his needs
602808 if you have 20 in your pocket are you going to spend it on entertainment or a box of condoms
602809 for a lot of people condoms are at the bottom of their list
602810 the world we live in is the world today not the world we want it to be
602811 we have to deal with the problems today based on what people do we have to meet people where they are
602812 what we need is to teach people to be empowered
602813 its not that all african american men are messing around in prison but a great majority are
602814 you have men coming out of prison who had sex with men and theyre not really gay theyre just taking care of their sexual needs
602815 hes not going to practice homosexuality when he gets out of prison hes coming home to his wife
602816 most heterosexuals are not honest about having sex with men while they are in prison
602817 its hard to confess to a spouse and african american men especially have a real problem admitting it
602818 people dont want their employer to know they have hiv
602819 in tarrant county there are less than 10 deaths a year
602820 i put a brave face on and i was saying i was all right
602821 but those things are not what was in my head
602822 i want a relationship but i am afraid to tell him i have hiv
602823 if a person knows you and likes you hiv shouldnt change their mind
602824 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year
602825 but this workout is mandatory and all players must attend its coach rods call on that this is his first year at u m and hes doing everything he can to make sure his team is successful

602830 wed take her to apply for a social security card but you have to have id first
602831 so you go try to get an id but you have to have a social security card first
602832 she told me that well shed stop drinking the cheapest beer and drink better beer so she wouldnt feel so bad finally i got her to agree to only have one in the morning and she stuck with it
602833 there is definitely going to be a period of adjustment
602834 there will be some rough patches were going to give debra every chance to succeed
602835 i was so excited because i had been waiting for a long long time
602836 during the interviewing process with big brothers big sisters they asked me why i wanted to get involved
602837 coach buzz andrews was a mentor a coach someone you looked up to all those words he was all of that for me i didnt have a father growing up so he was that sometimes too he is one of the reasons i am what i am today i wouldnt have made it without him
602838 making my second team is just a huge accomplishment in and of itself
602839 now to walk away with two medals i couldnt even describe to you what that would mean to me it would mean that all the hard work paid off knowing i did it the right way
602840 he had some academic issues and he kind of went by the wayside on those other sports
602841 i was able to mentor him and bring him home sit him at my table and make sure he got his homework i took him on as a project to try to help him pass enough classes so that he could participate he did and he had success doing it
602842 the result of it is he has changed his life he has married a wonderful woman and he is living a lifestyle that he probably would not have had the opportunity to do otherwise
602843 they have to come out here for all their road games
602844 the money that we allotted for this year wasnt enough because we didnt forecast prices to be this high
602845 we increased next years budget and we tried to accommodate for the extra cost of fuel we probably asked for 35 percent more than we did last year
602846 theyve been playing against pampa since the days when they took trains there
602847 there might be some growing pains associated with playing with the bigger schools but were going in that direction anyway
602848 we should just be good stewards of what weve been given while were here
602849 weve had a lot of 1a teams appeal to be in 2a because the travel was just too expensive
602850 it turns out to be a real advantage because one year you get to have two home games in a season
602851 what they do wont go as far as it used to
602852 the district is still in the process of making that decision
602853 if they did ask us to take a smaller band we would go along with it i feel like we provide an important part in the spirit of the school along with the cheerleaders
602854 we probably travel on 20 to 25 team flights a year our car rental and bus rental contracts havent gone up yet but we anticipate them to do so
602855 we normally get a certain allotment every year and this year we just told the coaches that its a big issue
602856 were not going to have as much new equipment this year
602857 its something that you didnt really think about as much beforehand but it makes us a lot more conservative
602858 weve been harping on improving our clinics for years and if we are going to make them efficient then weve got to act accordingly on this budget
602859 i think we need to recommend what is best for our patients if the county commissioners shoot us down then they can shoot us down
602860 i tell you i still think we are still looking at a 1 4 cent reduction
602861 ive been told by people who deal with omb office of management and budget that it supports a plan to recommend 57 billion in defense budget increases for 2010
602862 people forget that we had a similar or greater ramp increase in production on the f 16
602863 is to some extent a real plan and to some extent its a pentagon wish list
602864 a new administration is going to do a substantial review
602865 the fact a different administration would have to decide on spending the money and the fact we are facing a budget deficit of 500 billion makes any increase problematic
602866 at a time when many programs are being questioned or cut were fortunate to be one of the few being increased
602867 grin and bear it thats all i know to do
602868 i know that if it wasnt for the unction of the holy spirit i would have given up
602869 we thought we were going to just get kicked out
602870 they didnt want to take anything but the full payment
602871 i paid that for two whole years and then all of a sudden we heard it was going up
602872 you will park my 80 year old carcass in the street before you get my home
602873 my bigger question to charter involved what is going to happen in february i wanted to know if we would be required to rent additional digital boxes
602874 we need to find out who is giving them false information its totally false
602875 they lowered my bill by 5 and theyre putting the box in my bedroom
602876 theres nothing in the models that say its going to go away
602877 he would play this baseball video game and say you know dad your stuffs not very good
602878 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
602879 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
602880 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you
602881 and a comparatively hairless manny ramirez was still unhappy albeit in cleveland
602882 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
602883 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
602884 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
602885 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
602886 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
602887 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
602888 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
602889 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
602890 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
602891 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
602892 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
602893 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract
602894 id be lying if i said i thought it would happen like it has here in the past year
602895 i was on the verge of not wanting to play here any more dealing with the fans and not winning i was like all right ill get through with my contract and ill see what happens but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning
602896 but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning
602897 ricky davis is now an la clipper finishing at last his 8 or 9 year journey to his true destiny
602898 hey buddy need a couple of hundred thou for a house
602899 i served for two years on the freddie mac loan prospector advisory committee
602900 they claimed it was so they could hear from bankers and brokers about what they could do with not only their automated underwriting decision but how freddie could improve
602901 we as a group came up with many ideas yet the real reason we met in places like new orleans and the ritz in suburban washington was to promote their agenda
602902 they sent an armada of their people to the meetings and never really considered what we had to say
602903 during the peak of the bubble frenzy people would always ask me just how bad it could get
602904 i always said that some major bank failures and either bankruptcies or takeovers of some large home builders to possibly be followed by a federal bailout of the gses government sponsored enterprises would be the worst case scenario that scenario has now arrived
602905 if joe and jane taxpayer are going to be asked to bail them out during their time of peril they should also be able to participate and be rewarded in their future recovery
602906 what is going on is that a realistic view of the role of regulation has finally sunk in at the federal reserve the subprime problem was not unknown there but the attitude was that the markets could handle it
602907 well they cant so we will likely see a lot more regulatory activity in the housing and financial markets
602908 i am currently involved with one specific deal where the appraiser has insisted on making three return trips to the condo being financed and is still contending that minor touch up paint and tile work be completed before he gives the ok for the bank to release or sign off on the loan
602909 agents and sellers previously insulated from the changing financial landscape
602910 are starting to get the idea that this crisis is in fact going to affect them

602914 i havent said that centrifuges were sent to north korea under the presidents supervision rather i said that if they were sent they would have been sent with musharrafs consent and under the armys supervision
602915 president musharraf in his book in the line of fire has already stated that centrifuges were smuggled out of pakistan and in response to this i only said that such an operation must have taken place with the presidents consent
602916 i am not sure that such a statement has been given by khan
602917 it was a north korean plane and the army had complete knowledge about it and the equipment
602918 i am still under house arrest it is wrong to say that i am a free man
602919 its not me and i havent said anything new he musharraf has already said this in his biography

602925 economic growth is vital and developing countries cannot go green at the expense of growth and dependence on resources such as energy and fossil fuels a reality that will not change in the forseeable future
602926 nuclear energy has to be one of the alternatives to fossil fuel it is very sensitive in many countries populations dont like it there are many safety concerns that affect not just the countries and neighbourhoods where they are located but also various neighbours because if something goes wrong if the wind is blowing the wrong way then a lot of people downwind will be affected
602927 a lot of work has to be done still at the facilities like the sinergy centre we hope that at some point of course the activities will then enable policy reforms and regulatory reforms to take place

602950 the rapid development of shanghai has come at great social cost with entire quarters of the city having been bulldozed to make way for the gleaming skyscrapers the demolished blocks were largely home to the citys poor but the authorities and their private partners have made forced aquisitions of property without proper compensation and a contempt for fairness
602951 tenants in poorer areas whose buildings are under threat of demolition are regularly offered derisory sums of money that are completely insufficient to allow them to buy into the new development instead they are offered alternative accomodation far from the centre in wealthier areas the compensation is greater

602974 it is wrong for everyone not to have access to a library
602975 has everything been done that can be done certainly not library service is a municipal not an individual responsibility
602976 too often the struggle for public library services in cache county has been left in the hands of a few individuals the government entities in cache county need to continue to work together even more aggressively than in the past to to establish and extend public library services until every citizen has full access
602977 we must elect local public officials who value our public libraries
602978 how long do you wait for the county to step up to the plate
602979 the county ignoring any participation puts us in this situation
602980 the library should be county run say it louder they are not stepping up to the plate
602981 the ball is in the hands of the cache county council
602982 we feel the county has a responsibility to provide library services to its residents we strongly request that the county commissioners work out an agreement with the municipalities currently operating libraries in the county to provide library service to any and all members in the county without a user fee
602983 the cache public library board has continuously supported the concept of the best library service for the whole of cache county funded by all citizens through a dedicated library fund
602984 you county commissioners are abdicating your responsibility passing the buck
602985 a library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
602986 as a child my number one best friend was the librarian i actually believed that all of those books belonged to her i would take a paper bag with me and fill it up when she warned me that some of those books were too old for me i told her they were for my mother i have never regretted my dishonesty

602995 you could hardly pick up a general circulation or fashion magazine this week
602996 without seeing the fire and ice advertisement to much of the industry this was one of the most effective ads in cosmetics history in a sense it marked a new height in an industry where advertising is all important cosmetics are second only to food in advertising volume perhaps more than any previous ad this one successfully combines dignity class and glamour a trade euphemism for sex
602997 in your field you are a pulse taker and an opinion maker
602998 i dont know any and i dont know what a fire and ice girl is but im for em
602999 what you do is go to see hope or skelton or somebody of that nature and tell them about your new product coming out with oh a couple of million dollars in advertising and then the script writer writes it in so thats the way we get it in sort of inadvertently

603010 im not waiting on anybody to put me in the pool ill roll my own self to the pool thank you very much
603011 what ive been through is not big enough to keep me from where i am going in god
603012 break through rarely happens in one giant leap it usually begins with baby steps and id rather break free little by little than remain in chains for the rest of my life
603013 no matter what i have to crawl through no matter what i have to endure no matter who laughs at me no matter how unpopular it makes me no matter how many times i fall and have to get back up i am going to get back up again until the freedom of god is unleashed in every area of my life

603063 service sectors now account by far for the highest number of iso 9000 2000 quality management systems fundamentals and vocabulary covers the basics of what quality management systems are and also contains the core language of the iso 9000 series of standards a guidance document not used for certification purposes but important reference document to understand terms and vocabulary related to quality management systems in the year 2005 revised iso 9001 2000 quality management systems requirements is intended for use in any organization which designs develops manufactures installs and or services any product or provides any form of service it provides a number of requirements which an organization needs to fulfill if it is to achieve customer satisfaction through consistent products and services which meet customer expectations it includes a requirement for the continual i e planned improvement of the quality management system for which iso 9004 2000 provides many hints this is the only implementation for which third party auditors may grant certification it should be noted that certification is not described as any of the needs of an organization as a driver for using iso 9001 2000 section 1 scope but does recognize that it may be used for such a purpose see iso 9001 2000 section 0 1 introduction iso 9004 2000 quality management systems guidelines for performance improvements covers continual improvement this gives you advice on what you could do to enhance a mature system this standard very specifically states that it is not intended as a guide to implementation iso 900x
603064 the emphasis on certification tends to overshadow the fact that there is an entire family of iso 9000 standards organizations stand to obtain the greatest value when the standards in the new core series are used in an integrated manner both with each other and with the other standards making up the iso 9000 family as a whole
603065 in 1987 the british government persuaded the international organization for standardization to adopt bs 5750 as an international standard
603066 are you doing what the manual says you should be doing
603067 will this process help you achieve your stated objectives is it a good process or is there a way to do it better
603068 iso 9000 guidelines provide a comprehensive model for quality management systems that can make any company competitive
603069 opponents claim that it is only for documentation proponents believe that if a company has documented its quality systems then most of the paperwork has already been completed
603070 helps to mislead companies into thinking that certification means better quality undermining the need for an organization to set its own quality standards
603071 if you just want the certificate on the wall chances are you will create a paper system that doesnt have much to do with the way you actually run your business
603072 good business judgment is needed to determine its proper role for a company is certification itself important to the marketing plans of the company if not do not rush to certification even without certification companies should utilize the iso 9000 model as a benchmark to assess the adequacy of its quality programs

603180 we are all used to talking about these impacts coming in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren now we know that its us
603181 mitigation has got all the attention but we cannot mitigate out of this problem we now have a choice between a future with a damaged world or a severely damaged world
603182 wheat production in india is already in decline for no other reason than climate change
603183 failing to tackle it climate change will lead to floods droughts and natural disasters which can destroy poor peoples lives as well as their livelihoods

603186 the government needs to go further and introduce tough mandatory efficiency standards rather than relying on weak voluntary initiatives for every year of delay in getting rid of these bulbs 5m tonnes of co2 are emitted into the atmosphere unnecessarily
603187 new standards should also seek to phase out stand by instead the eu has just announced an anti dumping tariff on imports of energy saving bulbs from china which will make them more expensive

603192 weve seen successful action taken on carrier bags all across the world from australia to zanzibar and now its time for london to take a lead on this issue in the uk
603193 we are losing the battle in terms of hearts and minds of the public who now certainly believe that the plastic bag is a hazard to health and the environment and something we need to eradicate from society
603194 its our consumption of everything whether its petrol water or consumer goods that is driving virtually every environmental problem on the planet and it needs to stop we have shown that individual people can make a difference

603211 the problems we face are of a magnitude no one has seen in at least two generations

603214 consumers are always going to gravitate toward a more parsimonious solution that requires less behavioural change we know that new products or ideas are more likely to be adopted if they dont require us to alter our routines very much
603215 in an information filled world people screen heavily what new information they let in and i suspect that the run of the mill global warming story is just not crossing the threshold
603216 thinking about a global complex challenging and potentially very dangerous and disastrous thing and not knowing what to do about it makes us go numb or into denial
603217 why do people go to alcoholics anonymous or to weight watchers because in a group of like minded people they have the support accountability peer pressure and the shared experience of others to help make the change they also have opportunities to come together check on progress and get support around setbacks thats what we need for climate change to recover from our fuel addiction
603218 if everybodys ditching the gas guzzler ill do it too
603219 i dont think we need to sugar coat the challenges we face
603220 we just need to ask people to rise to their real potential and see that this is our moment for greatness if we create a sustainable future for everyone it will be an accomplishment as great as winning the second world war
603221 many environmentalists assume people wont do anything more than small steps and hope those small steps will build the political will for more substantive changes

603383 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
603384 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas

603401 although men have higher incidence and mortality from all non sex specific forms of cancer than women the public face of cancer in our study was overwhelmingly female
603402 this imbalance in television reportage of cancer may be distorting political and community perceptions about which cancers are most prevalent and tractable and thereby deserving of government and community support research investment and individual vigilance
603403 for example breast cancer attracts unparalleled research funding from individuals and governments while other cancers causing more disability struggle to gain a fraction of such support

603410 i am really happy with the result this was certainly one of my best qualifying sessions so far this season i was not expecting to start from fourth as the car has been quite difficult to drive over the entire weekend we struggled a bit with the balance but in the end i was able to make the harder tyre compound work very well and here we are i am now looking forward to the race
603411 im totally disappointed it looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way i was hoping it was so obvious he would be penalised right away and i could still get into q2
603412 it was a very tight battle at the front with marginal time differences we expected to see mclaren on the front row robert did a very good last lap and secured fourth which means he will be starting in between the two ferraris certainly nicks result is disappointing he complained several times about traffic on his last and important fast lap and missed getting into q2 we should be very happy if he scores a point from this grid position
603413 roberts performance was faultless and he got the most out of the car starting from fourth is an excellent position instead for nick it didnt go as expected he reported traffic on his last lap for him we are facing a very difficult race tomorrow because overtaking is almost impossible at the hungaroring
603414 im happy to have qualified in p12 today after a good lap on the final run in q2 pushed me a few places up the grid
603415 i got the most out of the car today and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top ten as it has been a while since we were that close im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race tomorrow from here nonetheless
603416 choosing which tyre to run was a really tough decision today and it was a difficult qualifying session
603417 with that went the chance to progress to q2 and the time from my previous run puts me in 18th place on the grid the lap was going quite well but a mistake at turn 11 meant that i had to abort the lap i have to settle for 18th place today and turn my focus now to the race
603418 p12 is where we hoped to be today so yes we have moved a little closer to the middle order again
603419 unfortunately both cars will be starting from the dirty side of the grid so holding position into the first corner will be key from there with a free fuel allowance jenson is in a good position to target the top ten with a good strategy and strong pitstops
603420 for rubens it is likely to be a difficult race in the absence of safety cars or other incidents so we have to stay sharp and be ready to take advantage of whatever opportunities may present themselves

603453 we used a virus the adenovirus that causes the common cold which we genetically engineered so it contained a piece of the malaria parasites coat

603549 el tema del indec fue manejado pol ticamente o medi ticamente
603550 en el gobierno manejamos otras encuestas pero no vale la pena ingresar en esa pol mica
603551 ustedes se preguntan si volver a a impulsar la resoluci n 125 y yo dir a que s porque por primera vez desde el advenimiento de la democracia las instituciones hemos discutido en serio con posibilidad de sancionar una ley que tocaba la redistribuci n del ingreso en argentina
603552 la autocr tica que deber a hacerme es cierto grado de ingenuidad frente a la reacci n de sectores muy poderosos econ micamente
603553 a dejar sus trabajos en escritorios y comenzar a ser activistas
603554 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them
603555 mom theres no need to lock the door ill be sleeping at girls name s house tonight
603556 we have submitted a detailed plan to punjab government to upgrade the healthcare services in the state which includes setting a medical education centre that would include nursing school opd centre and a large cancer hospital
603557 we are seriously concerned about the welfare of the people as a company in the business of health care we consider it imperative to provide the best possible medical aid to the people
603558 the years no doubt have changed me sir but then i suppose the face of a barber a prisoner in the dark are not particularly memorable
603559 this is the barbecue we had last night my picture is to the left with a cross over it your son joe myers
603560 as the kundalini shakti raises from the base of the spine towards the centre of the forehead
603561 when not interfered with by outside influences everything nature does is done with perfection yet my son shay cannot learn things as other children do he cannot understand things as other children do where is the natural order of things in my son
603562 the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world
603563 the steady cashflows generated by specialist journals that rely on subscriptions just 3 of its publishing revenues come from advertising and conferences are very attractive to investment buyers who need to pay off the debt used for a leveraged buyout
603564 it has received a preliminary approach from a further third party and as a result is providing access to information materials
603565 said alan spiro 47 who joined with bob mattei 54 and mark mattei 56 for the project under the name sabre amb
603566 it certainly would have been wonderful to open last year at this time
603567 but you have to play the hand thats dealt you
603568 consumer confidence is low the price of oil has a ripple effect on consumers who no longer have that additional disposable income
603569 which means the spread between supply and demand is unfavorable
603570 occupancy is declining which means the industry is losing pricing power
603571 delawares occupancy rate declined but delaware also built more rooms in the same period
603572 it creates an additional demand segment meaning a type of guest looking for convenience on and off the highway while theyre en route to another location
603573 it creates a level of demand for people who do not want to drive into the downtown area
603574 my phone has rung a number of times to tell me of people that tried to get into the hotel and they find out that its a one year lease and they couldnt get in
603575 its a great facility and its an asset to the community but adams county is not collecting hotel tax on it either
603576 if you are calling it a hotel you should be paying hotel tax to the county and if its an apartment building its in the wrong zone
603577 theres no doubt the former howard government did little to work with the states
603578 but under the rudd government weve moved from an era of confrontation to a period of cooperation
603579 but the states will continue to take the lead in delivering services and that wont change
603580 i disagree in terms of his prognosis and his prescription
603581 if there has been a diminution of confidence in performance of state governments i think hes largely to blame for it
603582 the answer to the current problems is not to continue to centralise power in canberra its to properly divide responsibilities between federal state governments and local councils
603583 the service unites people who have shared a similar experience of losing a loved one and often it can be devastating for the people left behind with so many unanswered questions
603584 the service heightens community awareness of the difficulties faced by families and friends of missing persons
603585 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
603586 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
603587 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
603588 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
603589 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
603590 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
603591 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
603592 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
603593 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
603594 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
603595 judges will have the discretion to impose the maximum sentence on criminals who commit the worst crimes
603596 three mates two clubs five knockbacks one punch up to 10 years in jail
603597 we expect the prison population will grow with serious offenders at the worst end of the scale thats where the pressure will come
603598 this was an issue that needed to be resolved were not looking at an election context
603599 it was an issue which with the recent court of appeal decision we had to act on weve moved expeditiously
603600 believe me its a real talking point in the prison this truth in sentencing in particular
603601 i think if it had of been brought in a long long time ago there would be a lot of people walking around now quite a lot
603602 the last thing i ever want to do is to make this issue political its not a political issue its a community issue
603603 you cant draw some arbitrary line and say well this is a most serious crime and this is not
603604 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
603605 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
603606 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
603607 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
603608 we received 47 civilians who were injured in the blast and so far five have died in the hospital three of them women
603609 its the largest number of civilians we have received from one incident in weeks
603610 du f r den tilbake en gang jeg vet ikke n r men jeg skal dele alt innholdet med noen andre f rst
603611 what a shame that he makes the little boy walk
603612 i want a stable job with a decent income that will give me options in life
603613 i would eather sell it for a very low price and have the money
603614 its maybe good if you have designs lying around but i wouldnt want to wait ages for them to find a client for it
603615 wish them the best of luck but i wont be using it until i can see some proof it works
603616 it was a good deal we had no obligation to talk to them
603617 once they made it worth our while to talk we were able to make a deal
603618 sleepwalking and eating or driving while not fully awake with amnesia for the event have been reported
603619 intended to keep more deserving american families in their homes
603620 the danger isnt in what people do tell you its in what they dont
603621 they have not solicited and gone after people who will tell them the truth
603622 it would be suicidal for someone who wants a grant to come out and publicly criticize the foundation
603623 if we criticize the foundation in our own names our funding will be cut or we will lose our jobs
603624 if you want to achieve the greatest possible positive impact youve got to figure out how to hear things from people on the ground who might know more than you about some pretty important things
603625 theyre probably at greater risk of being isolated from critical feedback than any other foundation in the world
603626 for the most part the gates foundation does wonderful stuff
603627 it doesnt help to create a few islands of excellence in a sea of despair and unfortunately thats kind of what theyre doing
603628 clearly theyre dedicated to the public interest but if the gates foundation isnt getting it right what are the controls
603629 that we decide were just not going to give money to certain groups
603630 they need to bring in people who are tough willing to challenge them and push the envelope
603631 its my sense that they need to do more of that
603632 they are unwilling so far to be as transparent as i think they should be
603633 they need to speak to a wider range of people uncomfortable as that may be
603634 the gates foundation must prepare itself to be criticized and should welcome that criticism
603635 when she decided to be in the drill team i thought why not it kept me out of trouble
603636 were cultivating the next generation of leaders and community builders
603637 it brings us together for one common cause to celebrate our victories and bond together to make things better that need improvement
603638 i have to put these on or my taps would hurt
603639 we have to keep going even when we get tired because people are watching us
603640 you just cant get the catfish and the hot links and the greens anywhere else at seafair
603641 and there were horses there and over there too were about the only ones left now
603642 you have to know its here its so peaceful that nobody messes with it
603643 i can see paying it next year if we have to but i dont know how we can sustain paying that big of a fee year after year forever
603644 it is a big change for them but it just goes to show how good of a deal they have been getting for so long
603645 the only rational way to make money here would be to sell it off to developers
603646 it frustrates me that after nearly a hundred years a government fee could end up being the thing that threatens this place
603647 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
603648 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate

603658 these types of sightings have been reported by pilots generally accepted to be reliable and sensible observers since the 1940s and they have excited attention to this day such light effects are often popularly thought to represent alien visitors but many ufo researchers believe they more likely represent natural atmospheric phenomena not yet fully understood by science however a similar encounter in 1978 over the bass straits in australia where the pilot was in radio contact with the ground throughout resulted in the pilot never being heard from again so these phenomena are important to study
603659 while no witnesses are infallible pilots are trained observers and less likely than most people to misidentify something mundane

603668 the nation which has learned to plot the paths of air masses accurately and learns to control the time and place of precipitation will dominate the globe
603669 possible effects of atomic and thermonuclear explosions in modifying weather
603670 our knowledge of the dynamics in the atmosphere is rapidly approaching a level that will make possible intervention in atmospheric and climate matters it will probably unfold on a scale difficult to imagine at present there is little doubt one could interfere on any desired scale and ultimately achieve rather fantastic effects
603671 within a few centuries we are returning to the atmosphere and oceans the concentrated organic carbon stored in sedimentary rocks over hundreds of millions of years the experiment if adequately documented may yield far reaching insight into the process determining weather and climate

603675 these stations are uniformly color coded with an easy to use system that allows for sorting different types of material
603676 this approach puts more money into the pocket of the local recycling center
603677 they do not receive as much money for paper when both white and color are mixed what happens is they sell that paper and that money gets recycled back into the community
603678 this recycling program at unity college helps improve the bottom line of our local recycling center and that is good for everyone concerned

603734 cuba is and will remain open to discussion at a level of equality and has proposed talks on illegal immigration and international terrorism
603735 cubans think its insanity that u s policy now allows only one visit by cuban americans every three years and does not allow certain medicines to be provided
603736 we can live without the u s but thats not what we desire
603737 we dont impose our view of how a society should be in the u s why does the u s impose its view on cuba

603770 its embarrassing to me that a state office is using these kind of practices to select a professional who goes out in the name of the state of oregon to audit records
603771 i asked one witness why is it that everyone is so young and i didnt really get answer im assuming its because you want people who dont have experience who will follow orders like lemmings and not question it
603772 it sounds as though youre having to send people out begging to see documents that are by law shown to them and theyre entitled to
603773 it sounds like thats their primary job qualification it sounds like theyre selling something instead of auditing documents
603774 when youre consistently passed over for substantially younger candidates with zero relevant work experience zero relevant life experience and you bring a wealth of credentials and experience to the table thats age discrimination
603775 because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain
603776 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
603777 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
603778 we have identified around 3 500 of these temporary consents but we operate on a risk basis

603813 its like being at a cocktail party where the easiest person to listen to is the one closest to you but we all have the ability to keep an ear out for other interesting conversations going on throughout the room
603814 it turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear listens to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell
603815 once a local calcium ion sticks to the c lobe it seldom lets go and so the local calcium dominates
603816 now that we are learning how these drugs actually work
603817 we can contribute our new understanding of calmodulin to the design of next generation drugs with greater potency and fewer side effects

603896 jelas bahwa dalam ajarannya ahmadiyah telah menodai islam dengan ajarannya tentang nabi baru dan tadzkirohnya yang sangat mengobrak abrik al quran yang suci
603897 pemerintah harus bersikap tegas untuk melarang ahmadiyah di indonesia ataupun menyerukan kepada anggota ahmadiyah untuk tobat dan kembali ke ajaran islam yang benar
603898 no not really but i do wonder what it was like before the americans came
603899 well honey you know that the native americans were here long before any white skinned people came
603900 yes honey thats right many native americans lived on the land that we now call the united states unfortunately when the white skinned people came they were not kind to the native americans and did really mean things to them
603901 yeah they hurt them and fought them and started war with them
603902 you do everything you can to put yourself into position to come out of that last pit stop in position to go ahead and then you put the gloves on and go for
603903 i still think our focus is on a good solid finish
603904 when we do that on a weekly basis the wins will come its real easy to lose focus of the big picture focus a little too much on winning and then make a mistake
603905 last year at this point we were struggling just to make a race and its basically been that way for 19 months
603906 but the first race here in june was a big confidence builder knowing that we could run up front all day
603907 i know its clich to say that were better than where we are in points 40th but i really do feel that well be running among the top 10 throughout the rest of the season
603908 he looked good and it was good to get him back out there
603909 he had an mri and the mri said he was ready to go i look forward to seeing him with the pads on today
603910 this is a big year for me personally and we have a great team
603911 i just feel like this is the year for me to establish myself as one of the elite tight ends which i feel like i am and i think my coaches feel like i am i just feel like the sky is the limit for me if i stay healthy
603912 i didnt need a rest and now im just trying to work my way back into things
603913 i feel good enough to come out here and practice i want to get my rhythm and establish a good relationship with donovan mcnabb i didnt play any preseason last year so i want to come out here and have a good preseason last year was a wasted year for me i was in and out training room missing games and i wasnt healthy until three quarters of the season and then i missed the last few games of the season everybody should take a vacation and get away but for me it was work
603914 everybody around me was saying that every year they have one person they slap the franchise tag on and they chose you i should feel positive and feel appreciative about that
603915 thats kind of what our guys said he could do for us when we picked him up
603916 he had four pitches working and he could throw them at any time thats why he had success and will continue to have success
603917 at bats like that can make or break a game if he gets a hit or drives the ball there he could give them some momentum i just wanted to make good pitches there
603918 it was nice to throw a good game not only for me personally but more importantly for the team we have two months left and we have to get wins
603919 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
603920 they are always the best fields in the game mickelson said of the wgc events which are not nearly as prestigious as the majors

603931 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
603932 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
603933 because i know what to do with gods fame with gods visibility with gods influence to jesus be the glory
603934 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
603935 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
603936 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
603937 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
603938 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
603939 nascars had a long standing relationship with the urban youth racing school and its a relationship that has been built around significant support from nascar and our many partners in the industry
603940 teams drivers tracks sponsors and manufacturers have all been supportive of the uyrs over the last 10 years and that support continues today
603941 there are certain parts of their program that weve had discussions about and we certainly believe the urban youth racing school has the potential to do more in the communities where the program has been established we look forward to working with them toward getting to this result
603942 why all of a sudden is nascar telling us that theyre not getting their moneys worth from our program theyve given us 250 000 since 1999 and theyve received over 4 million in positive impressions in the media
603943 theres no one on the planet when it comes to inner city kids who has diversified nascar more than i have
603944 ninety percent of the kids coming into our program know nothing about nascar but our curriculum teaches them about the sport as well as the career opportunities in nascar and they go back to their neighborhoods and share that experience with their friends and families what more could nascar want from me we are real when it comes to diversifying nascar
603945 were trying to create pathways that are realistic for these kids to get into the sport and nascar asks how many of our kids are actually working in the industry
603946 but in order for that to happen there have to be opportunities and once theyre there are they going to be mistreated or deal with racism you have to be open as an industry to really let people in
603947 i was 12 years old when i started at the uyrs and all i wanted to do was race that was the magnet that drew me in
603948 but then i actually did really well in the classroom and saw how many opportunities are out there working with gibbs is a once in a lifetime experience that you cant put a price on
603949 the uyrs is doing its part through an evolving learning process and emerging data suggests theyre having some success
603950 combine a chance for open dialogue with learning about math engineering science and technology while racing go karts the change in attitude toward education is magical
603951 weve been associated with the urban youth racing school for at least a decade and that includes participating in their annual banquet
603952 its very rewarding to see the enthusiasm on the kids faces as we go through the awards ceremony their genuine love of the program is very cool to experience
603953 just couldnt get him dewey is a great animal i wish him all the congratulations

603960 the brutality and savagery shown by xing xings killers is something i have not come across before and beggars belief
603961 is not this the kind of fasting i have chosen to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke to set the oppressed free and break every yoke is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter when you see the naked to clothe him and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood

603968 i like to play fast i get excited and i have to sort of control myself restrain myself but when the rhythm section gets cooking i want to explode
603969 its tough we hit every single play if we get up at 6 oclock in the morning were hitting at 7 you have to be a man about it
603970 we get together in the huddle and just say lets go
603971 coaches get comfortable with the guy thats there they get used to what hes good at
603972 you dont just have another guy show up and throw him in there and expect him to pick up where he left off thats why were out here for a month before the season starts
603973 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
603974 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
603975 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen today because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
603976 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him
603977 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
603978 he could be better than the big brown leading up to the kentucky derby
603979 hes been a guy who has needed a little adjustment time as he has moved up levels
603980 we wanted to get him to triple a and have him make his adjustments in august rather than out of spring training next year
603981 weve got some guys who think hes a three or a four
603982 i think he can be better than that i think guys mature people forget hes only 21 and with maturity he could get better i think he could be a legitimate no 2
603983 im working on about two hours sleep but i feel great
603984 i used to go to church every sunday and me and my friends ran a tea club for the older people i went every week until i was in my early when i started to discover other things in life like boys
603985 i feel lucky to be a vivid girl i know i can go far
603986 i went to college but i found it boring i was always a sporty chick a bit of a tomboy who liked going out with my friends and getting trashed
603987 i was modelling these really classy evening gowns at a show and saw these dvds i just thought i could be on the front of those
603988 i told the guys there i wanted to be a porn star and a couple of days later i was in the czech republic
603989 the first scene i did was in front of 50 people and i actually found it quite liberating i thought if i could do that i could do anything
603990 id never really even watched porn before but im a sexual person and id thought a lot about doing films
603991 i come from a very open minded family and they have been really supportive im a crazy girl so they would probably be more shocked if i was doing something tame
603992 my mum thinks its great and i show her all my nude pictures
603993 i just love the shock factor i just get a buzz off doing anything thats shocking i feel i dont have to prove myself to anyone as long as im happy with what im doing
603994 i used to be religious but now id say im a very spiritual person ive been to loads of tarot readers and psychic websites
603995 all of what has happened to me has been predicted in the cards and now its all coming true
603996 i have a friend i like like that and i don
603997 credible information evidence that the new patriotic party held a meeting on 8th july with some of its activists and other persons from the information services department at which meeting they i e the npp stalwarts hatched a number of plans to influence the electoral process in favor of the npp
603998 people in ndc strongholds by collecting their voter ids in order to disrupt the electoral process
603999 many artists have worked with elements and body fluids as
604000 i am an artist and working with photography and video i studied graphic design and photography in madrid and received a degree in photography and media arts in england recently for my minor project at the university i made a photographic project where menstruation is the nexus in the whole series i explore the female representation and menstruation has been an important area in my work as a sign of the feminine identity
604001 in this photograph below the girl is posing opposite the camera but the message which she is writing frontally on the white wall is the punctum the word amor which means love in spanish and it reveals my intentions in this series and my relation to the blood during menstruation seeing my own blood as a part of a female nature
604002 liliw is perhaps best known for its cold water spring resorts native homemade sweets and a sizeable shoe industry that rivals that of marikina city
604003 while in my mind they were a threat to do this in their minds it was only the americans that were a threat to do it
604004 they were concerned that maybe science in the states had progressed to the point where the athletes would have access to technologies that they werent looking for so they wanted an honest appraisal of how possible that was
604005 their government had instructed them that there were going to be no chinese athletes doping at the beijing olympics
604006 they wanted the chinese athletes to be scrupulously clean they didnt want an embarrassment on the world stage their major concern was the americans which was why they were talking to me
604007 have proven to be a lot more difficult so i dont think anybody has done any successful gene doping in athletes yet
604008 this is not a trivial thing that some athlete can inject themselves in a garage
604009 it may in the end keep it out of people during the period you would be undergoing immune suppression you wouldnt be in training you would be a hospital patient
604010 just because someone will sell you stem cells does not mean that they will do anything other than make money for the person selling them it shows how people are willing to make money at the athletes expense but is not likely to help anyones performance
604011 it does reinforce my belief that when gene therapy technology is more mature someone with the correct expertise will try to market gene doping to the athletes
604012 i guess when i watch sports ever since mark mcgwire and jose canseco ive watched with a little more of a jaded eye because it was so obvious watching those guys and looking at their body profiles that they were on steroids i was so incredulous at the time that baseball was ignoring it
604013 and then knowing the amount of doping that was going on in cycling from talking to people i know who are involved in that sport and it was being ignored for so long it does make you jaded
604014 you think well the authorities dont really care and they tolerate these things until it becomes a pr problem and then they go after it and so it does change your perception of sports and it reminds you that its more a business than a sport these days
604015 you dont believe it so you just have to wonder how long it is until they figure out what the person is doing
604016 and if they dont figure out and they win the gold medal at the olympics you walk away feeling well that was cheapened
604017 theres enough money here in athletics that people are willing to help the athletes like balco
604018 if somebodys made an undetectable steroid like balco was doing without a sample of it without any clue of what theyre doing wada is not going to be able to test it for this olympics and so the person may get away with cheating
604019 so i told them they might consider developing a test for that i dont know if they did or not
604020 thats why they have developed a list of coaches they felt were suspect and would try to dope the athletes they were really cracking down on them and testing everyone who was working with them in particular even though the chinese government and the chinese testing lab want to stop it they freely admitted to me that there were chinese coaches and athletes who would try to dope if they didnt stop them
604021 but i feel for those guys because i know how hard it is to go through those things to bust your butt in the off season and then to get injured in training camp i know how it is

604028 we didnt try to cram something in there when we werent prepared and they werent prepared
604029 i would have definitely been part of the conspiracy if someone would have done that
604030 i thought it was good that they could all feel like they were 30 plus today
604031 we had more players out for the spring than we had on the team last fall we wont be relying on freshmen as much
604032 its eye opening to get back to running and to get back in the pocket
604033 i just continued to throw my arm is probably stronger than its been and my timing is down
604034 our main focus is to find a tailback who wants to carry the ball 20 times a game and who separates himself from the group
604035 and on the offensive line are we tough enough are we rugged enough are we united on the offensive line
604036 we want to be the no 1 scoring defense in the conference and make an impact on special teams we know what we can do we have high expectations
604037 the bottom line is i like the way the team in coming and we need to stay hungry like every other team in the league
604038 its going to depend on how we practice as a team i believe as we progress the product will take care of itself to get the outcome we want we have to focus on execution
604039 we dont need to sit down we make up a game plan after weve started
604040 come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over

604044 if you wanna do my mother you gotta get her a benz
604045 i like paulos method which in most cases makes it evident not only that the strippeddown versions of the arguments fail but also that no refinement or elaboration will save them from their central shortcomings
604046 frankly i suspect that holt and orr simply mistake verbosity for profundity
604047 the month is generally weak in the first half then stronger in the middle
604048 while the us european and japanese are contracting moderately the asian economy continues to experience growth that is near its potential and south american growth is just below potential
604049 recent data releases and reports suggest that the consumer will continue to be pressured on all fronts income or cash flow wealth and credit consumers can spend using any of these buckets however with the labor market continuing to weaken housing continuing to deteriorate and credit harder to come by the outlook for spending remains bleak despite recent declines in gasoline prices
604050 it is nearly certain the fed will leave the federal funds rate unchanged at the august 5 meeting the market expects a higher federal funds rate at the end of the year we do not the details of the gdp report point to significant weakness in the economy against this backdrop and financial market fragility the fed would only exacerbate the economic situation by raising the federal funds rate in haste fighting inflation will have to remain on the back burner until financial and economic conditions improve by that time inflation is likely to be moderating as it is a lagging economic process
604051 if it walks like a recession and talks like a recession it must be a recession is the fed going to raise its funds rate target over the remainder of 2008 not bloody likely
604052 former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said the us is nowhere near the bottom of the housing slump and is right on the brink of a recession
604053 in an exclusive interview on cnbc greenspan said the us economy is holding up rather well considering the extraordinary pressures from the financial sector but he added that a recession appears inevitable
604054 whitney says loosely transcribed fed knows there is no quick fix every time they open window they lose fire power for next crisis there is not much capital out there that wants to rescue brokers i keep saying we are less than 50 done with this crisis and are still there all capital raised by banks so far 450 billion was only to plug holes and not to grow business all banks assets marked at unrealistic levels creditors have cut mortgages and credit lines to the areas with the worst house prices depreciation that will hurt consumers even more corporate loan market will get hit soon as well maria was prodding to find out how quickly the stock prices were going back to the highs pump pump pump whitney says there is no way the bank stocks will return to the highs in next 3 years no comment on 5 years out the brokers are not growing capital and diluting the shareholder they cant grow earnings that way merrill raised tremendous amounts of capital just to plug holes they still have to shed assets and are not out of woods yet most every bank has to write down assets like merrill and raise capital banks who got in bed with housing assets such as c ubs mer bac wb will be in the market soon to do another capital raise everyone was involved in mortgages all of these banks are in trouble now 25 institutions will have to raise capital in next two months banks will cut dividends i dont understand why banks raise capital and then still pay a dividend it is not prudent for board members to keep paying when they are so capital restrained fannie freddie in same situation as every other institution all banks are betting on house price assumptions that are far too optimistic no banks are close to case shiller due to banks bad math losses will apply to everyone across the board in 2006 07 2 5 trillion was securitized nobody can replace this mortgage money and housing prices will continue to suffer as a result when maria asked if lehman will survive she said huh huh huh huh huh huh i dont know i am very opinionated on the short selling rule if you want to have faith in the capital market there has to be two sides to every trade and people have to be able to hedge restricting free trade will have the opposite effect and endanger the markets jamie dimon and goldman are pros and very cautious and aware of risks
604055 the us may now be in a very long recession that will drive the unemployment rate higher with little that the federal reserve can do to help said harvard university professor martin feldstein
604056 i dont see recovery on the horizon feldstein who headed the national bureau of economic research until june and serves on the groups recession dating panel said in an interview with bloomberg radio
604057 feldstein said the fed has already lowered interest rates as much as it can to help growth and that exports offer the only bright spot while they arent strong enough to fuel a recovery
604058 the next president should not be raising taxes feldstein said he said he was really surprised that obama hasnt backed off his proposals for a major tax increase
604059 feldstein said todays gross domestic product figures reinforced his view that the economy entered a recession in december or january gdp shrank at the end of 2007 and grew less than forecast in this years second quarter the commerce department reported today
604060 fed officials have lowered their benchmark rate to 2 from 5 25 since september bringing the reductions to a halt in june amid rising concern that inflation will accelerate feldstein indicated the central bank should refrain from lowering borrowing costs further
604061 real gross domestic product of the us economy grew at an annual rate of 1 9 in the second quarter following a revised 0 9 increase in the first quarter this report also contained revisions of gdp estimates going back to the first quarter of 2005
604062 real gdp grew at a slightly slower pace during the period of revision 2005 2007 the most noteworthy aspect was the contraction in real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 0 2 from an increase of 0 6 as per the previously published estimate
604063 in the second quarter consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 1
604064 exports of goods and services grew at an annual rate of 9
604065 total nonfarm payrolls fell by 51 000 in july the seventh consecutive monthly decline

604067 the white house cut its forecast for us economic growth this year and indicated president george w bushs successor will face the dual headwinds of rising unemployment and faster inflation
604068 us gross domestic product will grow 1 6 this year and expand 2 2 in 2009 the white houses council of economic advisers said in a mid year review today the forecasts were slashed from an outlook in february for 2 7 growth this year and 3 for 2009
604069 the effects of the economic slump have worsened the job market and the white house forecast the jobless rate will average 5
604070 the us economy has continued to expand but growth has slowed as a result of the sharp housing decline disruptions in financial markets and high energy prices the report said
604071 the consumer price index will rise 3 8 this year compared with a february forecast for 2 7 the white house said next year the cost of living will increase 2 3 faster than the 2 1 gain predicted five months ago
604072 the white houses latest forecast for gdp growth was similar to private economists for this year and more optimistic for 2009 the economy will expand 1 6 in 2008 and grow 1 7 in 2009 according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by blue chip economic indicators this month
604073 the us treasury on monday said its borrowing would increase to 171 billion this quarter let us note three important points 1 budget deficits increase 50 to 100 in recessions 2 official budget deficit estimates historically greatly underestimate the deficits due to ridiculous assumptions and 3 surging nationalization and socialization is substantially increasing us guarantees and debt
604074 the credit squeeze in the us economy is likely to persist for many months and might even get worse gary stern president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis has told the financial times
604075 he said that with interest rates at 2 the fed was well placed to cope with any negative surprises on growth by contrast he said it was not as well positioned to deal with any negative surprises on inflation
604076 even without any such surprises the minneapolis fed chief also said real interest rates were at levels that if sustained for too long would not be compatible with medium term price stability
604077 an asset deflation in turn becomes a debt deflation pimco estimates a total of 5 trillion dollars of mortgage loans are in risky asset categories and that nearly 1 trillion dollars of cumulative losses will finally mark the gravestone of this housing bubble the problem with writing off 1 trillion dollars from the finance industrys cumulative balance sheet is that if not matched by capital raising it necessitates a sale of assets a reduction in lending or both that in turn begins to affect economic growth creating what mohamed el erian fears as a negative feedback loop
604078 president george w bush signed into law legislation that helps 400 000 homeowners facing foreclosure and extends a lifeline to fannie mae and freddie mac
604079 bush signed the measure at the white house shortly after 7 a m spokesman tony fratto said treasury secretary henry paulson housing and urban development secretary steve preston and federal housing administration director brian montgomery were among those present
604080 we look forward to putting in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets and to provide better oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac fratto said
604081 the law is aimed at stemming foreclosures and halting a free fall in housing prices by providing federal insurance for refinanced 30 year mortgages for homeowners struggling to make their monthly payments
604082 the measure also is designed to restore confidence in fannie mae and freddie mac by tightening regulations and authorizing the treasury secretary to inject capital into the two biggest u s providers of mortgage money
604083 banks have been given a one year reprieve by us accounting standard setters from having to take up to 5 000 billion of debt assets on to their balance sheets easing fears that they would be forced to raise large amounts of new capital quickly
604084 the financial accounting standards board voted to delay until january 2010 the introduction of rules that will force banks to consolidate more off balance sheet vehicles directly in their accounts
604085 robert herz fasb chairman said that the move was made reluctantly after a staff recommendation for a delay because there might not be enough time for all companies to adjust to the up heaval
604086 it does pain me to allow something that has been abused by certain folks to let that go on for another year he said
604087 recent data releases and reports suggest that the consumer will continue to be pressured on all fronts income or cash flow wealth and credit
604088 high inventories suggest still falling house prices putting further pressure on consumers balance sheets
604089 access to credit is likely to become harder to come by and more expensive
604090 consumer cash flows seem unlikely to improve anytime soon the labor market weakness evident in the claims figures suggest continued weakness in non farm payrolls
604091 data through may 2008 released today by standard amp poors for its s amp p case shiller1 home price indices the leading measure of us home prices show annual declines in the prices of existing single family homes across the united states generally continued to worsen in may 2008

604094 rising mortgage rates and mounting inventories warn that the us housing slump is far from over
604095 congress is trying to ease the burden on stretched homeowners and moved decisively to prevent a meltdown in the gses
604096 bond yields have risen in recent months pushed up by increasing inflation concerns and comments from some members of the fomc federal open mouth committee financial institutions are also belatedly widening spreads and tightening lending standards
604097 banks struggling to recover from multibillion dollar losses on real estate are curtailing loans to american businesses depriving even healthy companies of money for expansion and hiring
604098 two vital forms of credit used by companies commercial and industrial loans from banks and short term commercial paper not backed by collateral collectively dropped almost 3 over the last year to 3
604099 the scarcity of credit has intensified the strains on the economy by withholding capital from many companies just as joblessness grows and consumers pull back from spending in the face of high gas prices plummeting home values and mounting debt
604100 the second half of the year is shot said michael t
604101 companies that rely on credit are now delaying and canceling expansion plans as they struggle to secure finance
604102 merrill lynch is to raise an extra 8 5 billion in fresh capital on top of 23 5 billion already raised in the past 12 months as the beleaguered investment bank took some drastic steps to right its capital position
604103 merrill which just two weeks ago announced plans to raise almost 8 billion from asset sales including its 20 stake in financial news provider bloomberg revealed that it needs to raise the money after disclosing that it will take a financial hit of 10 6 billion in the third quarter
604104 the news will come as a surprise to the financial community which had hoped that the worse was over for merrill which has already been one of the largest victims to date of the continuing credit crisis
604105 prior to this latest series of writedowns and exceptional losses merrill has already written down 40 billion in assets and other instruments
604106 but chairman and chief executive john thain said that the news was positive because of the fact it has been able to off load the substantial majority of its positions in a certain type of complex debt vehicle
604107 mr thain who took over from stan oneal last december said the news marked a significant milestone in our risk reduction efforts
604108 leading global banks including citigroup and ubs on tuesday faced renewed pressure to write down or sell billions of dollars in toxic assets following merrill lynchs disposal of 30 billion in mortgage related securities at a cut price
604109 merrills move to sell collateralised debt obligations cdos for 6 7 billion or 22 cents on the dollar announced on monday night raised hopes that other banks would be able to strike similar deals and purge their balance sheets of bad assets
604110 however the low price paid by lone star funds a distressed debt investor to buy merrills cdos sparked fears that the financial system could enter another spiral of huge writedowns followed by highly dilutive capital raisings
604111 merrill on tuesday raised 8 5 billion to offset 5 7 billion of writedowns caused by the cdo sales and other losses by selling shares at 22 50 a 7 5 discount to mondays close
604112 mike mayo deutsche bank analyst said merrills action a fortnight after john thain chief executive said that it did not need more capital raises ongoing credibility issues for the industry
604113 developed market bond yields should move markedly higher through the rest of this summer but then fall sharply going into 2009 says daniel pfaendler head of g10 economics amp strategy at dresdner kleinwort
604114 he believes the oil price shock and the unwinding of asset bubbles over leverage and economic imbalances in general should keep growth significantly below trend and real yields depressed for a protracted period of time
604115 price stability oriented central banks having learned their lessons from the 1970s should become more hawkish in the near term thereby limiting the upward pressure on long run inflation expectations mr pfaendler says
604116 however he believes inflation will peak around autumn and then fall significantly into 2009
604117 he adds that the positive growth effects of us tax rebates should dissipate raising the risk of a simultaneous recession in the us the eurozone and the uk during winter
604118 therefore real yields and inflation expectations should be able to fall in tandem making long duration as well as curve steepening exposure across developed bond markets attractive again
604119 do you remember treasury secretary paulson rushing all over the world beijing moscow berlin tokyo you name it
604120 the dollar on a purchasing power parity is ridiculously cheap now
604121 in my opinion that was the deal that was the reason why paulson was running all over the world with his secret message
604122 faced with a swelling federal budget deficit as a slowing economy saps tax revenues the us treasury is expected to boost the frequency of 10 year note sales and offer more 30 year bonds next month
604123 analysts estimate the treasury will announce plans to sell 15 billion to 16 billion in 10 year notes and 9 billion to 10 billion in long bonds at its refunding announcement on wednesday
604124 theres a realization that these higher deficits are going to be with us for a while because the outlook for growth in the second half and into next year has deteriorated said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap in jersey city new jersey
604125 could we be watching a vicious but erratic correction in an ongoing bull market as far as im concerned this is the multi trillion dollar question of the day and the month and the year because if this is a correction rather than a primary bear market then this market could tend to hold and this market could be building a base and if so then 18 billion shorts will begin to get squeezed and if this market is in the process of building a base then the big money will begin slowly and subtly to re enter the market
604126 fullermoney has been very cautious regarding western banks for a number of months not least because of the weak performance and obvious fundamental problems
604127 i would now describe my view as cautiously bullish which requires some explanation
604128 taking a longer term view i would not be surprised to see a signification consolidation within the western banking industry over the next few years this will inevitably favour the strong players meanwhile conservative investors may prefer bank bonds to equity
604129 looking at the charts action for bank indices such as s amp p 500 regional banks dj euro banks and ftse 350 banks we certainly had climactic action in mid july as pointed out at the time
604130 while these bank indices have eased in the last three days after encountering overhead resistance evident from the january march range lows they have retained more of the recent rally than broader indices in the usa continental europe and the uk this may have something to do with the recent investigations regarding shorting but it could also indicate that the banks themselves are less bearish of their sector from a bullish perspective it would be encouraging if bank indices maintained their recent relative strength and also held at least half of this months gains
604131 the outperformance of japanese stocks over the past few months looks set to continue believes paul danis equity strategist at lehman brothers
604132 after strongly underperforming from early 2006 to march this year japan has outperformed the global equity market by 14 in dollar terms and 24 in local currency terms since mid march he says we think that the rally has legs
604133 mr danis notes that the total cash yield in japan has bucked the global trend and kept rising as net stock buybacks have increased in contrast to the us and uk
604134 mr danis also says that while the economic backdrop in japan is far from great he expects growth to be strong relative to the rest of the world some key japanese economic indicators are showing resilience and there are continued signs that japans economy is exiting a deflationary period
604135 he adds that analysts have aggressively marked down japanese company earnings expectations while for the world ex japan composite earnings are still at peak levels there is scope for this gap to close which should benefit japanese stocks relative to global markets in aggregate
604136 we recommend investors with a global mandate overweight japan in equity dedicated portfolios
604137 the three major currencies of central europe have appreciated strongly against the euro so far this year boosted to varying degrees by rising interest rates strong economic growth and positive investor sentiment the latter buoyed by the final confirmation that slovakia will adopt the euro next january
604138 zimbabwes economy is unravelling at such a pace that the central bank is set to slash yet more zeroes from the countrys increasingly worthless currency
604139 state media on sunday quoted gideon gono the reserve bank of zimbabwe governor and one of the members of the ruling elite targeted by fresh western sanctions last week as saying he would extend a currency policy that has so far failed to stem hyperinflation
604140 this time we will make sure that those zeroes that would come knocking on the governors window will not return mr gono was quoted as saying on saturday in a speech to farmers
604141 independent estimates put zimbabwes inflation rate well above the official 2 2 million per cent prompting the introduction last week of a 100 billion zimbabwean dollar note even state media reported mr gonos comments drew laughter from his audience
604142 the governor is expected to chop three or six zeroes from the currency following a three zero cut in 2006
604143 beside the inflationary zeroes haunting mr gono analysts and some opposition politicians say the crumbling economy in what was once a regional bread basket is perhaps the single greatest factor that might force robert mugabe president into relaxing his grip on power
604144 the government blames the economic strife on illegal sanctions condemning opponents who point to violence land seizures that have contributed to a drastic fall in agricultural output
604145 global growth is downshifting and the cyclical economic backdrop is no longer supportive of further commodity price gains
604146 inflation angst should begin to recede now that food and energy prices are gradually coming off the boil
604147 the weaker growth outlook along with reductions in energy subsidies and a tightening in policy by several emerging market central banks because of inflation concerns related to the commodity boom will only reinforce the tendency for commodity demand growth to slow
604148 1 the oil price is currently by far the most important factor in terms of global gdp growth consequently it is also a huge influence on the direction of various stock market indices and big moves up or down have a psychological leash effect on other commodities including gold
604149 i am a long term believer in peak oil but a short term sceptic even some of the best and most farsighted analysts often predict dramatic seminal events many years before they actually occur not least i suspect because life is short and our time is precious
604150 meanwhile the daily chart of crude oil has shown increasingly conclusive evidence of a significant peak commencing with that big downward dynamic on 15th july
604151 heavy bets in deep out of the money calls and other bullish plays in the gold options market indicate bullion has a shot at rallying to an all time peak of 1 200 an ounce by the end of the year
604152 gold has soared furiously a few years ago the metal was trading at 250 an ounce as investors poured into the market due to inflation fears a weakened dollar and market turmoil
604153 there are a lot of people who think that by the end of the year well be trading 1 200 to 1 500 they are not very expensive options so people are buying them
604154 bilello said that many option investors were currently adjusting positions after golds sharp fall but he saw recent strong volume of december 1 000 calls bull call spreads between 1 200 and 1 300 and the selling of put options all of which are betting that gold will rise further
604155 inflation in europe accelerated to the fastest pace in more than 16 years in july restricting the european central banks room to bolster the economy even as unemployment starts to increase
604156 the inflation rate for the 15 nation euro region rose to 4
604157 the ecb which aims to keep inflation just below 2 raised its key interest rate by a quarter point to 4 25 on july 3 a seven year high the risk is that higher borrowing costs will exacerbate the economic slowdown europes manufacturing and service industries are contracting and confidence in the economic outlook this month plunged the most since the september 11 terrorist attacks in 2001
604158 the growth outlook has deteriorated said martin van vliet an economist at ing group in amsterdam who doesnt expect the ecb to raise rates again
604159 australia may be headed for a housing recession similar to those roiling the us and uk

604164 bank of japan policy should remain accommodative as imf directors see little risk in delaying monetary tightening the washington based lender said today in its annual review of the japanese economy
604165 the funds 1 5 growth forecast for this year matches the median estimate among economists surveyed by bloomberg news the assessment indicates japan will avoid a contraction even as exports weaken hurt by slowing demand in the us and europe
604166 the japanese economy has shown resilience to the us slowdown and global financial turmoil the imf said in the review the near term economic outlook is for a soft landing although there remain risks from the global economy
604167 inflation excluding food and fuel prices is expected to stay contained and an undervalued yen may rise against other currencies it said
604168 inflation in japan accelerated in june to 1 9 the fastest pace in more than a decade because of surging energy and food prices
604169 japan was until recently in deflation and so price pressures remain mild compared with most of the world excluding energy and food cpi rose just 0 1 last month
604170 japans inflation is not caused by domestic demand so the bank of japan is seen to have little scope to raise rates from the current level of 0 5 the banks concern is increasingly turning towards growth
604171 this month the central bank cut its economic growth forecast from 1 5 to 1 2 for the year ending march 2009
604172 the squeeze on consumers is likely to hit consumption in the second quarter coupled with last months first export decline in more than 4 years some economists are forecasting that second quarter gdp growth will be negative

604246 celebrate the achievements and reaffirm the values of a great organization
604247 let no individual section faction or group ever regard itself as greater than the organization
604248 our nation comes from a history of deep division and strife let us never through our deeds or words take our people back down that road
604249 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
604250 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
604251 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
604252 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
604253 the tactic could cut both ways it might tap into the qualms some white working class voters in crucial swing states may have about a black candidate or it could ricochet back against the mccain campaign which has been accused even by some fellow republicans of engaging in overly negative campaigning in recent days
604254 we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it incur with president clinton say whatever you want about president clinton his record on this issue is above reproach
604255 the mccain campaign has obviously been watching our primary very closely and recognized how damaging it had been to be tagged with the charge of race baiting
604256 what they did to mccain in 2000 is what mccains trying to do to barack obama in 2008
604257 the exchange was reminiscent of several flare ups over race during the democratic primaries when the obama campaign complained about comments made by bill clinton in support of the candidacy of his wife
604258 its getting a lot of attention which is exactly what it was designed to do
604259 everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
604260 they ran a ridiculous ad thats insulting not to us but to the american people he said
604261 this is beneath him its beneath sen mccain and now to inject this race card issue takes it one step beyond that you have to ask what happened to john mccain what happened to the campaign he promised to run
604262 obamas pioneering status is inspiring to some voters and discomfiting to others and the way in which race is discussed may push voters toward or away from him mccain could benefit from discomfort with race or he could like hillary rodham clinton his predecessor in battling obama be distracted and ultimately diminished by constant charges of racism accurate or not
604263 its the first time in a while and he doesnt like it
604264 the retort was we must say not only contemptible but shrewd it also and we wish this were coincidence but we doubt it conjures up another loaded racial image the phrase dealing the race card from the bottom of the deck entered the national lexicon during the o j simpson saga
604265 it seems like we hit another low note every day from this campaign
604266 also suggested that obama would rather lose a war than an election is personally responsible for the rise in gas prices and is a celebrity on the order of tabloid divas britney spears and paris hilton
604267 the big question for the mccain campaign is whether this is worth of john mccain or whether it demeans him with frivolousness
604268 three months before election day john mccains stepped up aggression begs the question will voters vote for the scold
604269 in striking an aggressive pose mccain is in danger of letting the caricature of an angry petulant candidate take seed not so much because he is one but because it stands in stark contrast to obamas carefully cultivated well celebrity and mccains own promises to run a respectful campaign
604270 if voters find that obamas image doesnt match the one mccain is peddling they may reject him a lesson jimmy carter learned in 1980 when he painted ronald reagan as dangerous and out of touch

604274 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good

604278 statistics vary but the latest national survey of steroid use among teens reports that 3 5 percent of high school seniors admitted to using steroids at least once that doesnt sound like a lot but its a 67 percent increase over the 1991 and a 17 percent increase over figures cited by the national institute on drug abuse in 1999
604279 the high price of steroid testing is often cited as a reason steroids are not included in most scholastic random drug tests
604280 we cant go around testing a whole bunch of people for steroids wed run out of money
604281 now that its in the news every day teenagers equate steroids with doing well in sports making lots of money and being successful
604282 we can educate at least 15 kids through atlas and athena for what it costs to conduct a single steroids test

604286 they want to endanger the internal stability in more than one country and region
604287 when i was choreographing for bombay dreams i realised that for them the term bollywood means cinema of the 70s the first half is based in the 70s and the second half in 2007 the decade of the 70s was the period when interesting films were made there were stars like dharmendra amitabh bachchan rajesh khanna and hema malini on the top it was a fun era
604288 the styling for the film is unique totally like the 70s in the first half ive used cars which were used by rajesh and hema guru shirts which were made popular by rajesh have also been used i had to do a lot of referencing with hair dressers i have used props from r k studios like the lights and cranes etc
604289 it wasnt tough to make him do that but he said he would have to work on his body before doing it he worked hard to get those six pack abs ive shot so many songs on him earlier that i always wanted him to do an item number for me the way ram gopal varma shoots item numbers on his heroines with waterfall in the background and i did just that in om shanti om i am glad for shah rukh since it is a great change over for him at the age of 42

604293 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
604294 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
604295 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
604296 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
604297 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
604298 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections
604299 we need a comprehensive national aids strategy with measurable outcome targets a timeline for action increased funding and a particular focus on those most at risk including racial and ethnic minorities
604300 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
604301 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
604302 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
604303 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
604304 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
604305 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard

604319 ich hoffe sogar dass ich in meinem leben immer etwas k mpfen muss
604320 doch ich muss mich bis zu einem bestimmten ma damit abfinden
604321 when i got off the plane in switzerland last monday and my knee was swollen id say my chance of competing at the olympics were 0 1 out of 10
604322 now i give myself a six out of 10 chance maybe seven out of 10
604323 absolutely i give myself a chance of riding at the olympics its feeling better all the time but i want to get it to eight out of 10
604324 i want to do what is the best thing by the team
604325 were hoping he will be in the road race and certainly hell be competing in the time trial
604326 ive had a little too much drama over the past two weeks
604327 what happened at the function at the hard rock cafe was that the floor was wet and i slipped
604328 it was an accumulation of fatigue and sitting on a bike for three weeks which from a posterial and physical point of view is not good for your body
604329 my orthapaedic surgeon told me people have had a lot worse injuries by slipping in their own baths
604330 national coach shayne bannan called me with the time trial news and i was on the table getting treatment with my knee all bandaged up in ice and an electro stimulator attached
604331 he said weve got that second place i looked at my swollen knee and thought oh good for you
604332 every day im doing the physio and treatment on my knee and everyday its getting better but well decide on monday morning whether i go or adam hansen goes in my place
604333 for me to go and start the time trial id have to have a pretty stellar ride in the road race
604334 i dont want to go unless i can do a good result for myself and the team or contribute to a good result for the team
604335 so if i dont recover from my injury and am not close to my best i dont mind staying at home
604336 treatment on cadels knee has been going well and were hopeful that on monday hell get the all clear to fly to beijing
604337 all the evidence is there and the rba needs to act sooner rather than later
604338 i used to have two staff and now i have none its just me now i used to do double the amount of money its never been this low
604339 instead of waxing once a month they say they will leave another two or three weeks
604340 the gym went up by 5 per cent last week but my pay packet hasnt gone up by 5 per cent
604341 i have a mortgage so id like to see an interest rate cut but it would only be because the economy is going bad so its good on one hand and bad on the other
604342 im feeling and sensing it in the community petrol prices are hurting our clients because we have clients from everywhere travel here
604343 it would be great it would help us a lot we have more than an average mortgage so its 75 a month extra every time theres a rate rise she said
604344 im fortunate enough to own my own home but we leverage that he said
604345 i believe two interest rate rises ago they went too far we have been scared into a recession by speculation and innuendo
604346 consumer confidence is gutted were fortunate enough to have kids at school in sydney but we have to cut back on visits and supportive things back home like giving money to charities
604347 the cost of fuel is a major expenditure for people in this business so it eats into your bottom line
604348 im lucky i am on a fixed rate but that changes next year he said
604349 im not looking forward to that i havent had to make any major cuts yet but it may impact on christmas holidays
604350 i have three children as well so its hard entertaining them is expensive it costs 60 to go to the movies
604351 everythings more expensive i live with my parents and i would love to buy a property but its just too hard to save she said
604352 economist have expressed surprise at the sudden and rapid deceleration of the economy
604353 were not like the other australian banks in the sense that we are much more international weve got operations not only in the us and that capital but in the uk and new zealand
604354 and there are times when thats a great advantage and other times when its been a disadvantage but the banks in very strong health
604355 we certainly dont believe any downgrade would be appropriate the banks in very strong shape and at an operating level things are going extremely well
604356 i was just practising a couple of things that id read about
604357 shell be perfect love if she looks anything like you shell be beautiful
604358 its pretty easy to argue that this is the most prestigious competition of its kind in the world
604359 the reason is that the signature part of the prize is a 50 concert tour all around the united states canada and mexico
604360 a lot of other competitions are things you put on your resume and then move on but with this the exposure you get is something that can start a career
604361 i said if were going to do this lets invite a bunch of the people who ive met on my travels that have blown my mind
604362 its kind of a geek fest a star trek convention its a safe place for a lot of people
604363 the classical guitar landscape used to be much more fragmented than it is now
604364 when the foundation was started in 1974 there were maybe three or four schools in the country where you could get a degree in guitar performance now there are about 500 you can get them anywhere
604365 and having all these thriving guitar programs has created a whole generation of dedicated and interesting guitar professionals
604366 because unlike violinists we cant go take auditions for orchestra jobs
604367 but the twist with guitarists is that were more likely to cross over into other kinds of music pop jazz flamenco world music and so on and although the concerts at the convention are primarily classical the foundation does try to help those cross pollinations
604368 also because guitarists dont have as rich a history in the classical and romantic eras were probably more active in trying to cultivate new music guitarists tend to be very cutting edge in trying to figure out just what the life of our instrument is
604369 having the convention here is a real feather in our cap
604370 its a recognition of the importance of the city with people like david encouraging composition and sergio selecting this out of all the places he could have gone
604371 there may be more players in new york or los angeles but if you think of places where there is a lot of activity and a vibrant scene its san francisco
604372 the biggest challenge is that most aboriginal peoples numeracy and literacy levels arent that good and arent sufficient to be able to do the general mine training courses
604373 we need a lot of pre training to get people ready to join the mining industry or any kind of industry
604374 we need to have a longer term target than two years i think we need to establish cradle to grave strategies for employment and training
604375 we need to start focusing children as young as grade two and ensure that they are starting to establish the basic foundations in numeracy and literacy
604376 from the highest in the land to the employers of two or three people only the question to me is how can i help
604377 im gratified by that and i believe this is now an idea of australian employers not of mine of australian employers whose time has come
604378 what i do know is that unless you set targets unless you set goals we have one as a government its called closing the gap you turn around in five 10 or 15 years and theres no progress
604379 far better to set some ambitious goals even if you fall short and i commend andrew forrest for his ambition
604380 a welfare only response to these communities is precisely the wrong way to go
604381 weve got to get housing right weve got to get education right weve got to get health right but weve also got to get jobs right
604382 and thats where corporate australia comes in and i look forward very much to partnering with our major australian corporations in what is their initiative
604383 ive hung around corporate australia for a number of years ive heard a lot of goodwill from people but ive never been actually sure about whether those doors are openable from the outside
604384 we all wish he would come back but he has given no indication that he will
604385 i suppose we are all publicly saying what a terrific bloke he is what a fantastic political talent he is how much we miss him we love him we want him
604386 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
604387 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once but sadly have not yet had and probably never will
604388 peter costello has earned the right to make the decision about his future with his own family in the best interests of both them and the people of higgins
604389 as ive said privately and publicly i would be very happy for peter costello to stay on in the parliament
604390 not going to elect dogcatchers but we may have the presidency
604391 it is the worst fundraising that i have ever seen
604392 candidates who were at 700 000 last time are now at 100 000 those who should be at 350 000 to 500 000 are at 70 000
604393 will gain house seats again this year the only question is how many
604394 to get 41 you need 45 because youre always going to lose a few republicans
604395 a new president gets a honeymoon period for the first two years thats his best chance of passing sweeping legislation
604396 the soviet union saw a tide of new weapons designs in the late 1980s which didnt reach a production stage
604397 they can be described as new only in a sense that they werent built in numbers
604398 i dont think that we are lagging behind in a critical way
604399 the loss of technologies and the brain drain have led to a steady degradation of military industries
604400 now when we finally get state orders plants often cant fulfill them due to the lack of components
604401 there is an acute shortage of key specialists turners welders millers
604402 we built good planes in the past because we had a competition between aircraft makers
604403 but that doesnt mean im afraid to use my 45 dont underestimate me just because im a woman
604404 the numbers continue to grow in spite of the violence were witnessing
604405 certainly few women have the chance to become queen kingpins
604406 yet their mere existence may serve as a role model and symbols of female power for common women in the drug trade or those considering such a career
604407 were definitely seeing more women and were seeing them playing a more important role
604408 they have other skills to influence rivals theyre more persuasive and more organized about their activities whether money laundering or running their own operations
604409 as many of the current female smugglers look to her as a successful role model
604410 everyone talked about la nacha and so in a way la nacha and my aunt became my role models into a different more adventurous life
604411 the key is not to let any male dominate you either in bed or in the heart its all business
604412 at least thats my philosophy and one that i believe has kept me alive all these years
604413 it was a very difficult life not as pretty as was described to me
604414 i used to go two or three times a week after work but now i just stay at home and go once every now and again
604415 i do more drinking at home now than at the pubs theyre more for special occasions since its becoming so expensive
604416 brewing is a major industry beer our national drink and pubs a treasured part of our national culture
604417 sadly the trade repeatedly shows that it cannot be relied upon to consistently act in a responsible way
604418 theyre increasingly more friendly to families the quality of the food has increased
604419 about 52 000 german civilians mostly children perished in various camps in yugoslavia between 1945 and 1947
604420 were not counting german soldiers just innocent civilians who had in no way participated in the occupation
604421 most of those buried at this site were children and there can be no harm in marking their grave
604422 the old falsified history is now being corrected under a democratic government
604423 they have never been in the focus of public attention because in comparison with numbers expelled from elsewhere their total is not very high
604424 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
604425 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
604426 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
604427 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
604428 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
604429 many people want more tribal involvement and management and some want it turned over to the tribe
604430 my job is to balance the park service mission and very strongly listen to what the tribe is suggesting and maybe do something that should have been done long ago
604431 the thing we havent done with each other is listen
604432 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
604433 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
604434 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
604435 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
604436 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
604437 the scientific community is really going to run with this
604438 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
604439 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it

604441 das werk der separatistischen terrororganisation mit blut an den h nden
604442 its not necessarily james bond like spying where you have some super spy penetrating the deepest u s secrets
604443 its trying relentlessly to get defense related technology from u s companies u s engineers and the u s military
604444 theyre claiming that we built this house with money he earned illegally
604445 theres isnt a shred of truth in it not one dime
604446 he is totally unable to lie it is not his nature hes as honest and truthful and trusting as they come
604447 it would take unfathomable millions multiple millions and millions of dollars
604448 the idea was to design a building that would actually help your mind recover
604449 its hard but at the end of the day when you walk around to the front of the building and look up at it you remember why youre doing this
604450 so if u s congress does not grant a waiver by the end of september it means your astronauts in 2012 will be preparing for their missions on the ground and will not be flying
604451 the bottom line is that congress is very wary of russia
604452 its going to be difficult for any government agency to get an exemption
604453 if we dont get it well end up with no access to space
604454 if he wins a ring this year hell stay there forever
604455 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
604456 pretty much the one thing that i didnt want to happen happened
604457 i came here after a trade and got hurt its really disappointing that i cant help the team
604458 a couple of games at the end of the year
604459 when i get traded for five guys theres a lot of expectations
604460 thats in the past i still keep in contact with some guys but other than that im not thinking about all that i watch the highlights but i cant tell you the numbers and stuff
604461 its frustrating for something to happen like that and for him to go through that
604462 you try to do that your whole life being a baseball player and being a pitcher and now he just cant do it anymore and hes young its frustrating for him and its frustrating for the people that know him i wish him all the best
604463 hes a guy thats drawing some attention to himself with the type of season that hes having
604464 the chances of us getting him back sept 1 are zero
604465 as long as we felt he was healthy strong and ready to go i would not hesitate
604466 a bit of a reality check might be good for the guys bring us back down to earth
604467 it just reinforces how tough it is to win away from home and i think we need that heading to south africa
604468 we were confident whether we were over confident i dont know
604469 you dont see too many roads without bends in them
604470 well of course we didnt know it was going to be the biggest concert in history we knew it was going to be a very big concert and he clearly hoped to raise a lot of money and as far as i remember i think i flew in a couple of days before the show
604471 i remember that it was a pretty major wonderful show fantastic show but there was a bit of concern about eric when he flew in because of the problems that he had at that time and everyone was really concerned and i think this sense of concern was everywhere really
604472 everybody was just excited and thrilled that it went so well everybody had a good time with each other there was no egos
604473 this isnt just a cookbook its a way of life
604474 what if theyd bombed the railroad lines to the camps
604475 youll notice that our book is published by ben yehuda press he only invented modern hebrew that son of a jew so i guess ill see you at your jewish book fair right
604476 my 94 year old writing partner couldnt be here tonight because he has a standup gig playing the cedars sinai hospital
604477 with struggles being waged by black people in the areas of education housing employment and many others it was only a matter of time before afro american athletes shed their fantasies and delusions and asserted their manhood and faced the facts of their existence
604478 a lot of the black athletes thought that winning olympic medals would supersede or protect them from racism but even if you won a medal it aint going to save your momma from the effects of racism it aint going to save your sister
604479 once my husband threw away my medication into the pit latrine
604480 he said that he did not want to see these medicines in his house
604481 where do you get the time to talk to 100 people about their vacations

604483 wed rather experience a nuclear meltdown than put up with your deranged family
604484 i wish people would give us notice before just dropping in
604485 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
604486 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
604487 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
604488 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
604489 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
604490 i dont think that prices will return to the record level nor will they fall below 100 per barrel
604491 what some media reported that kuwaits oil reserves are less than that is wrong and not based on scientific record on the contrary there are new discoveries
604492 the doctors can do nothing for my brother he has gradually become weaker and now spends much time in a deathly state speechless and still i am determined to help him my wife has begged me not to go but it is my duty to look for a cure for this accursed illness we retrace my brothers steps through europe and into the very heart of transylvania in search of the evil of his illness dr cornelius van helsing london spring 1907
604493 the hebrew writer of the bible was not so well acquainted with egypt as has often been imagined
604494 d they sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt
604495 and josephs master took him and put him in the prison a place where the kings prisoners were confined
604496 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in to pharaoh
604497 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
604498 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
604499 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
604500 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
604501 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
604502 go yourselves and take for yourselves straw where you can find it but do not diminish from your work anything
604503 the lord god of the hebrews has met with us moses and aaron and now let us go we beseech you three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
604504 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
604505 and the egyptians made the people of israel serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard slavery in mortar and in brick and in all kinds of service in the field all their service which they made them serve was with rigor

604508 a career in the arts has always been difficult to establish but in the last few years the process of breaking in has changed as digital technologies and shifting economics profoundly alter the ways in which art is made popularized and consumed whether that constitutes a disaster or an opportunity depends largely on how old you are
604509 we should break down we should get into a fistfight
604510 i tell concert promoters are you willing to take 50 000 in cash in your driveway and burn it and then come back to work the next day then maybe youre cut out to be a concert promoter
604511 he got you to say yes and you didnt even know how
604512 if you ever think youre going to do well youre not
604513 nothing is ever going to be easy you have to work yourself like stupid
604514 my friends are all on the road breaking their back on a tour that i built
604515 and i am not there sweating each show out dealing with the everyday struggle of being on the road
604516 and i would rather live the lifestyle that i live
604517 music in a way has turned from being its own revenue stream into becoming added value for corporate brands
604518 hes definitely an amazing role model for the way to break into the business the whole industry at this point is about providing services for artists and if you can find a way to work with a band or grow with that band youre creating a job for yourself sean has created 10 jobs for himself
604519 im not regretting anything but maybe i should have rethought and changed little things
604520 he finished the tour that he set out to do
604521 you do it because you have a love for music and a love for what you do i know in the future it will pan out
604522 how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
604523 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
604524 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
604525 so then i figure we have somebody blow the guys head off ah hahahaha
604526 perlakuan yang diterima oleh penduduk arab palestina tahun 1947 dan 1948 secara moral adalah tidak bisa diterima sebagaimana terjadinya pembantaian atas enam juta orang yahudi oleh nazi walaupun secara kuantitas hal itu tidak bisa dibandingkan dengan tindakan kriminal yang dilakukan oleh nazi tapi secara kualitas bisa dibandingkan
604527 seolah olah tidak ada orang palestina di palestina dan kami datang dan melempar mereka keluar dan merampas negara mereka mereka sama sekali tidak ada
604528 ketika kami menyelesaikan persetujuan yang permanen kami akan mendapatkan 78 persen tanah sementara orang palestina hanya akan mendapat 22 persen saja
604529 tugas kami adalah untuk menciptakan jurang pemisah dan sekali lagi menebarkan ketakutan atas orang arab di wilayah itu

604531 kami mendapatkan perintah untuk mengetuk setiap pintu rumah untuk masuk dan membawa pergi kaum lak lakinya orang orang yang lebih muda usianya kami perintahkan untuk berbaris dengan tangan dihadapkan ke tembok dan para serdadu memukuli mereka di bagian perut dengan tongkat pemukul hal ini bukanlah inisiatif perseorangan hal ini adalah perintah dari komandan kami setelah seorang serdadu selesai memukuli seorang tawanan serdadu lainnya akan berteriak padanya kamu nazi dan orang yang pertama akan menyahutinya ketika seorang serdadu mencoba untuk menghentikan pemukulan atas orang arab itu perkelahian pun pecah
604532 interogator israel secara rutin memperlakukan dengan kasar dan menyiksa para tawanan arab para tawanan ditutup kepalanya dan matanya dan kemudian digantung dipergelangan tangannya untuk waktu yang lama kebanyakan dipukuli dibagian alat kelaminnya atau bagian lain untuk menyiksa secara seksual kebanyakan dari mereka juga diserang secara seksual sementara yang lainnya diberi sengatan listrik
604533 tidak ada negara di dunia dimana penggunaan cara penyiksaan secara resmi yang berkelanjutan dilakukan sedemikian mapan dan mendapat dukungan sebagaimana kasus yang terjadi di israel
604534 setelah ditahan seorang tawanan mengalami masa kelaparan kurang tidur yang dilakukan dengan metode metode yang terorganisir dan memperpanjangnya dimana tawanan tadi diperintahkan untuk berdiri dengan tangan terbelenggu dan terangkat ke atas selembar sarung sementara selembar karung yang kotor menutupi kepalanya para tawanan kemudian diseret ke tanah dipukuli dengan benda benda ditendang ditelanjangi dan ditempatkan dibawah pancuran dengan air sedingin es
604535 thomas are mengingatkan akan dietrich bonhoeffer seorang pastor yang aktif yang datang untuk meyakinkan bahwa dia dan para pendukungnya telah dicekoki dengan kedustaan bahwa pembunuhan dan penyiksaan ribuan orang laki laki wanita dan anak anak karena tidak melakukan riset yang cukup pastor semacam bonhoeffer hanya akan menganggu jemaahnya reverend are telah mengerjakan pekerjaan rumahnya dan menurut saya telah sering dan lama berdoa selama dia menulis buku yang berani itu
604536 buku ini akan membuat pembacanya berontak buku itu menyeru anda untuk memberikan suara atas nama orang orang yang tidak bisa bersuara
604537 kami tidak dapat membiarkan orang lain untuk mendikte cara berpikir kita atas masalah apapun khususnya atas sesuatu yang sama pentingnya seperti keimanan kristiani yang diuji oleh tindakan untuk mencari keadilan bagi orang orang tertindas hal ini adalah tugas orang orang kristen untuk mengetahuinya
604538 suarakan opini anda bagi bangsa palestina dan anda akan mendapat banyak musuh namun sebagai seorang kristen kita harus bersedia untuk mengangkat isu isu ini yang hingga sekarang kita pilih untuk hindari

604568 how is it that it took me so long to realize a truth so obvious and simple as this
604569 man is an image everything experienced is temporary and deceptive and this universe is a shadow
604570 appear to us arranged in a series of events in this series the single events which we remember appear to be ordered according to the criterion of earlier and later
604571 space and time are forms of intuition which can no more be divorced from consciousness than can our concepts of colour shape or size
604572 who is it that sees the three dimensional bright image that is formed in the brain
604573 my son even if something weighs as little as a mustard seed and is inside a rock or anywhere else in the heavens or earth god will bring it out god is all pervading all aware
604574 alas for us what is this book which does not pass over any action small or great without recording it
604575 i am creating a human being out of dried clay formed from fetid black mud when i have formed him and breathed my spirit into him fall down in prostration in front of him
604576 the world is made up of images these images only exist in our consciousness and the brain is one of these images
604577 human consciousness is only the result of the functions of the brain
604578 how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the djin when aladdin rubbed his lamp
604579 in this confusing material of the universe there is something that perceives itself as i am
604580 our thoughts are the product of our atoms and neurons
604581 open your eyes and a scene fills your view effortlessly close your eyes and think of that scene and you can summon an image of it certainly not as vivid solid or complete as a scene you see with your eyes but still one that captures the scenes essential characteristics
604582 cause precedes the result or the end of a phenomenon appears after its beginning
604583 each one of the sense organs is intricately adapted to deal with its own type of stimulus molecules waves or vibrations but the answer does not lie here because despite their wonderful variety each organ does essentially the same job it translates its particular type of stimulus into electrical pulses a pulse is a pulse it is not the color red or the first notes of beethovens fifth it is a bit of electrical energy indeed rather than discriminating one type of sensory input from another the sense organs actually make them more alike alsensory stimuli then enter the brain in more or less undifferentiated form as a stream of electrical pulses created by neurons firing domino fashion along a certain route this is all that happens there is no reverse transformer that at some stage turns this electrical activity back into light waves or molecules what makes one stream into vision and another into smell depends rather on which neurons are stimulated
604584 cause precedes the result or the end of a phenomenon appears after its beginning
604585 those who learn the secret of matter feel great excitement
604586 no images do not form in the brain the incoming signals form a representation of a visual experience
604587 definitely not what we see in our brain is a copy of the world
604588 the brain simply processes the incoming signals and orders neural activity that is how you see and hear
604589 when you see a bus coming towards you you get out of the way to avoid being crushed that means the bus exists why should you get out of the way if you see it in your brain
604590 you realize that matter actually exists when someone hits you
604591 you can have no doubt as to the existence of matter when someone kicks your knee
604592 when a bus has hit you you understand whether it is in your brain or not
604593 in that case go and stand on the motorway in front of the oncoming traffic
604594 it is true that i see all objects in my mind but i am seeing things that actually exist outside
604595 matter exists outside my brain the pain when a knife slips and cuts my hand and the blood that flows from it are not an image what is more my friend was with me and saw it happen
604596 i may see the knife in my brain but the sharpness of the blade is a fact just look how it has cut my hand
604597 what you are seeing is just perceptions this knife is not real the blood flowing from your hand and the pain in it are not real they are just events you are witnessing in your mind
604598 i am a materialist i do not believe in such claims there is a physical reality in everything i am now seeing look cant you see the blood
604599 all these things are perceptions and you can never reach the original sources of these perceptions nor can you know whether these originals even exist or not
604600 is saying that matter is an illusion we perceive in our minds compatible with islam
604601 the greatest reformer of the 10th century according to the muslim calendar
604602 gods creation is at the sphere of senses and perceptions
604603 gods creation is at such a sphere that at that sphere there is no permanency or existence for objects apart from senses and perceptions
604604 whatever exists in the universe is but a perception it is like a reflection in a mirror or a shadow
604605 if everything is an illusion how can we explain some of the attributes of god
604606 this is an old philosophy that was once put forward by the idealists
604607 is the subject of the truth of matter the same as the idea of the unity of being wahdat al wujud
604608 how can anyone love something he knows to be an illusion if we accept that everything is an illusion formed within our minds how are we to love our mothers fathers friends and the prophets
604609 call on your partner gods and try all your wiles against me and grant me no reprieve my protector is god who sent down the book he takes care of the righteous
604610 and behold ye come to us bare and alone as we created you for the first time ye have left behind you all the favours which we bestowed on you we see not with you your intercessors whom ye thought to be partners in your affairs so now all relations between you have been cut off and your pet fancies have left you in the lurch
604611 a person wants his loved ones to be as real and permanent as he is
604612 a person wants his friends to be as real and permanent as he is how can they be any different
604613 to conclude that the universe is a collection of perceptions means abandoning enquiry into how the universe functions in other words science
604614 is there not a contradiction between describing the being of god with the proofs of his existence in nature on the one hand and saying that the physical world put forward as a proof of his existence does not exist on the other
604615 if we accept this account then there can be no concepts of lawful or unlawful
604616 these people are just images in my mind so it does not matter if i lie to them
604617 we thought we were not responsible that is why we are here
604618 everybody says leaves are green when they look at a tree since everyone describes this tree in the same way that means it does not exist in my mind alone
604619 we can never say whether someone else sees the rose which we see as red in the same way as we do or whether what we see as blue he refers to as red
604620 there are the ways things look to me and sound to me and smell to me and so forth that much is obvious i wonder though if the ways things appear to me are the same as the ways things appear to other people
604621 i am in a garden with two friends and the three of us see exactly the same things if what we each see in our minds is the same that means that there must be originals of these things outside our minds
604622 we perceive the external world as it actually is so there isnt any abnormality in our behavior for instance when we come to a cliff we stop instead of keeping on and walking over the edge
604623 there is a physical world out there however everybody sees that world differently in his own mind
604624 there is a material reality out there and we see it as it is nobody sees it any differently the proof of this is that when there is a cliff edge out there we see it as such and stop walking
604625 there is an outside world but we see this world differently from how it truly is
604626 we perceive all that we experience in our minds and we can never make direct contact with any sort of original independent entity for that reason we can never know whether these originals exist in the external world or not
604627 there is no doubt that god shows us these images in order to test us however why should god the creator of all actions bring about such a test
604628 everything is an illusion so there is no point in worship
604629 from what we have seen so far our perception will continue even after death will that last forever are heaven and hell nothing but totalities of perception
604630 can we never directly experience absolute existence i am uneasy at knowing that i exist only in a world of perceptions
604631 is the end of this world of perception nothingness can people remain in that nothingness
604632 can someone who understands that everything is an illusion continue to be tested in this world
604633 it is all an illusion so it does not matter
604634 let someone else do a bit ive done all i can
604635 if god is showing me this image then he wants me to find a solution and i am responsible for doing so
604636 is it really true that god is everywhere does his sovereignty not lie in the heavens
604637 god must be somewhere we cannot see in space or somewhere far away in the sky
604638 we have variegated throughout this koran all kinds of examples for people but more than anything else man is argumentative
604639 knowledge of them is with my lord in a book my lord does not misplace nor does he forget
604640 if everything is an image what is the purpose of carrying out our religious duties
604641 do you argue with us about god when he is our lord and your lord we have our actions and you have your actions we act for him alone
604642 we were your followers so why do you not relieve us of a portion of the fire
604643 all of us are in it god has clearly judged between his servants
604644 our lord give him who brought this on us double the punishment in the fire
604645 how is it that we do not see some men whom we used to count among the worst of people did we turn them into figures of fun did our eyes disdain to look at them
604646 call on your lord to make the punishment less for us for just one day
604647 how is it that it took me so long to realize a truth so obvious and simple as this
604648 man is an image everything experienced is temporary and deceptive and this universe is a shadow

604670 kurang enak bersarung dan berkopiah tidak bebas bergerak apalagi kalau kita pergi ke sawah atau kebun
604671 kami kan tidak mewajibkan orang orang pegayaman berpakaian seperti itu
604672 nanti ketika mereka mulai beranjak tua mereka pun akan berpakaian seperti saya berkopiah dan bersarung
604673 buat apa kalau mau makan kita datang saja ke rumah orang pasti diberi makan dan kopi
604674 banyak unsur kesenian muslim yang bisa dipadankan dan dipadukan dengan unsur kesenian tradisional bali
604675 sejak berdiri gambuh ini sudah seperti ini padahal di pacung hingga kini tak terdapat pemukiman warga muslim
604676 jika berbagai jenis dan unsur seni dari berbagai etnis dan agama ini dipelihara dan dipadukan maka buleleng tentu akan sangat kaya dengan berbagai jenis dan bentuk seni budaya
604677 i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention but she didnt make that clear
604678 it didnt seem like she was telling me to go away if shed told me to leave id have done so straight away
604679 that was at 12 33pm i know because just a minute before id made a call from my mobile to check how much credit i had left
604680 i know i have done wrong in the past and if i could go back in time and change that i would
604681 ive missed out on so much i should have been getting on with my life who knows what i could have done and achieved
604682 i dont want to spend any more time in any of her majestys holiday camps i wont follow women anymore i know its wrong
604683 i will be vigilant from now on i am never going to give anyone the chance to send me away again i have changed
604684 i think the lesson really is that in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who might be responsible for the crime
604685 i think they did close their mind after the arrest of barry george
604686 while we have our loan challenges and are working through them were shrinking our balance sheet and creating cash
604687 they kind of leave the builder in the lurch so the builder has to cough up the funds to get the loan back
604688 we were so much earlier in our identification of our loan issues
604689 weve got about a four or five month head start
604690 that were at the conclusion of our risk identification process although that can change
604691 since their stock prices are down anyway theyre just trying to flush all the expenses they can so they wont have those expenses in the future
604692 christina applegate was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
604693 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me
604694 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do
604695 activities that are not in accordance with interpretations of the religion of islam
604696 our state is a weak state that doesnt dare to enforce the law if it goes against the religious feeling of the majority
604697 the state has no right to say you may or may not worship
604698 right to worship according to their own religion or belief
604699 we call on muslims to fight ahmadiyah to kill ahmadiyah kill kill kill
604700 if they refuse to return to mainstream islam kill ahmadiyah clear them out of indonesia god is great
604701 the police didnt do anything when they burned down the mosque
604702 if we had taken action the riot would have worsened
604703 if ahmadiyah is the first one to be banned then other minority groups will be the next target
604704 after the israeli occupation refused to receive most of those who fled gaza dozens have returned and the palestinian police have taken them into custody
604705 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
604706 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
604707 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
604708 at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
604709 tony blair continues to be 100 percent supportive of gordon brown and the government
604710 ich habe zwei kinder die auch gerne hier und dort helfen wollen ist ja gut gemeint aber meist zeigen sie damit nur ihren guten willen sp ter klappt es dann doch nur selten ist es denn nicht irgendwie gef hrlich wenn behinderte ihre dienste anbieten wollen
604711 es ist wirklich schade dass sich fast keiner ein bild davon macht was behinderte alles tun k nnen irgendwie denken die meisten bei behindert nur an menschen die schwerst k rper oder geistig behindert sind es wird nur schwarz oder wei gemalt aber es gibt auch viele farbt ne dazwischen das vergessen viele menschen leider immer wieder
604712 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
604713 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
604714 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
604715 the key for us this season is we have to make significant improvement on defense
604716 never played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture
604717 i wanted a change i wanted to get away from the humidity of the east and i wanted to see the mountains and deserts of the west
604718 i got interested because i had so much fun with the seventh grade girls that i wanted to coach again
604719 i love coaching i wanted to coach volleyball so i applied for the high school position and i got it
604720 i think its going to take a few years to really build a team the way id like to
604721 but im really excited about where they the players are coming from theyve been practicing all summer im really excited and anxious to get started
604722 im excited about having natalie become the head coach of our varsity volleyball team
604723 thats the most important thing women could do for each other
604724 we would rather have a man with cs than a woman with as
604725 you know how we feel about women in this job
604726 theres a glass ceiling up there and its real folks
604727 im going to take the risks she did and try my hardest and show the guys what i can do as a police officer
604728 im proud of all the work our youth city council is doing
604729 im just really proud of them and the city is too
604730 the primary purpose of this whole campaign is to put more people on payrolls without reducing the wages of those already at work even it its only to put on a young man or woman at 12 50 a week
604731 we have a home field in dayton where they gave us the key right to do our vending and pretty much run it as an naba national adult baseball association field
604732 were going to be playing a lot of games there
604733 you could have a goat if you can ride it
604734 the country fair joined the duo because they had similar audiences
604735 weve got more police officers available to us than we did a few years ago
604736 by infusing some of our extra personnel were seeing the reduction in crime primarily in areas weve seen a lot of crime over the years
604737 thats just great to present to a jury if in fact some suspect wants to take it that far
604738 weve done a lot of good work and i think the cops out there should get the credit for it
604739 weve got some tough challenges ahead of us with the economy the way it is
604740 her first words were she was very happy to see very nice people she was ecstatic
604741 the numbers that the method used for calculation of the impact fees generated even i will admit were somewhat mind numbing in relation to going from no road fees to a set schedule of fees
604742 now 30 months down the road special interest groups in alliance with some elected city officials have made every effort to derail what they presume is our task
604743 ill be the first to admit were in over our heads here we need to back off and slow down
604744 are we really going to see the kind of growth projected
604745 id really like to see us scale down on this model
604746 we cannot support these kinds of fees we need to revisit this whole thing
604747 id really like to see similar sized cities used for comparison purposes
604748 i cant swallow 5 6 per square foot additional costs on a commercial building to try and fund these projects
604749 we need ideas on how to fund these things to avoid gridlock
604750 all of these roads identified for inclusion in the impact fees are ndot roads
604751 one of ndots goals is to reduce its inventory of roads which drastically reduces their maintenance expense my recommendation would be that we engage in discussions with ndot for the city to take over ownership of some of these roads and in exchange they would help us finish the needed improvements
604752 there comes a time in life to decide new challenges
604753 weve built the best d as office in the state it would be a wonderful challenge to take
604754 there is little appetite in churchill county and lyon county to spend money on something thats nice to have
604755 we invited everyone to the table to learn more information
604756 no untoward incident has been reported from any where in the region on sunday
604757 no as the real killers sivarasan suba and dhanu were already dead
604758 the real reason behind the meeting is still to be revealed by priyanka
604759 the meeting is unique there is no comparison in the world history priyanka and nalini do not know each other prior to the meeting it is unexpected for a daughter of a victim in a gruesome murder to meet an accused who had been sentenced with death penalty later on converted to sentence for life
604760 whatever may me the reason for not coming out with real reason for meeting the courage and the generosity of priyanka should be appreciated the outcome of the meeting in no way helps nalini
604761 my next project is more than likely going to be a childrens book
604762 i wrote one book a good number of years ago for my eldest son zafar so it only seems fair to resurrect the tradition for my 11 year old son milan
604763 las primeras estimaciones del sistema del cdc revelan que la epidemia de vih es y ha sido peor de lo que se conoce previamente los resultados indican que aproximadamente 56 300 nuevas infecciones por vih se produjeron en 2006 en estados unidos
604764 esta cifra es casi un 40 por ciento m s alta que las anteriores estimaciones del cdc de 40 000 infecciones por a o que estaban basadas en informaciones m s limitadas y m todos menos precisos
604765 los datos confirman que hay un fuerte impacto de esta epidemia entre los hombres gays y bisexuales de estados unidos as como entre los hombres y mujeres negros
604766 necesitamos desarrollar programas que apunten espec ficamente a aquellos que est n en mayor riesgo como afroamericanos hispanos y hombres que tienen sexo con otros hombres
604767 dr yunus is accompanying him as rahul gandhi visits our microcredit programmes in suburban singair and manikganj
604768 the service unites people who have shared a similar experience of losing a loved one and often it can be devastating for the people left behind with so many unanswered questions
604769 the service heightens community awareness of the difficulties faced by families and friends of missing persons
604770 dad i am not chattel or cattle please just present me and as far as officiating i just want you to be dad that day
604771 theres no doubt the former howard government did little to work with the states
604772 but under the rudd government weve moved from an era of confrontation to a period of cooperation
604773 but the states will continue to take the lead in delivering services and that wont change
604774 i disagree in terms of his prognosis and his prescription
604775 if there has been a diminution of confidence in performance of state governments i think hes largely to blame for it
604776 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
604777 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
604778 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
604779 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
604780 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
604781 unless workers aged 55 to 59 increase their saving substantially or work beyond age 65 they will be unable to maintain their current standard of living and will have to reduce their standard of living significantly more than todays retirees to minimize the risk of exhausting their financial assets
604782 uh do you know its going to be like 96 degrees
604783 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
604784 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
604785 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
604786 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
604787 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
604788 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
604789 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
604790 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
604791 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
604792 we received 47 civilians who were injured in the blast and so far five have died in the hospital three of them women
604793 its the largest number of civilians we have received from one incident in weeks
604794 we believe its readily achievable and were well on the way to getting there
604795 while most of australian aquacultures 793 million value is produced in south australia and tasmania now opportunities are clear for queensland western australia and the northern territory where access to suitable farming sites is available
604796 apart from our own local market it is the asian european and american markets which are hungry for quality australian seafood
604797 aquaculture will play a major role in meeting this demand
604798 the wild catch sector cannot meet demand for this premium product so farmed product will step up to fill the gap
604799 farming fish can also be done year round and so is not restricted to seasonal cycles as in the wild
604800 judges will have the discretion to impose the maximum sentence on criminals who commit the worst crimes
604801 three mates two clubs five knockbacks one punch up to 10 years in jail
604802 we expect the prison population will grow with serious offenders at the worst end of the scale thats where the pressure will come
604803 this was an issue that needed to be resolved were not looking at an election context
604804 it was an issue which with the recent court of appeal decision we had to act on weve moved expeditiously
604805 believe me its a real talking point in the prison this truth in sentencing in particular
604806 i think if it had of been brought in a long long time ago there would be a lot of people walking around now quite a lot
604807 the last thing i ever want to do is to make this issue political its not a political issue its a community issue
604808 i have friends on both sides and i personally have not been able to choose its a lot of pressure
604809 there hasnt been this much advance demand for a book since the seventh harry potter book was released last summer
604810 ever since the first book came out its been steadily building in popularity im 50 and i read it and ive talked many women my age into reading it its very romantic though theres no sex in it at all i think this notion of a byronic hero who has to restrain himself to protect the woman he loves resonated with a lot of female fantasies
604811 stephenie meyers writing might not be spectacular but shes an amazing storyteller
604812 what i like about the world that she has created in twilight is that there are rules about what vampires can do and what they cant do and the rules dont change in the harry potter books sometimes she rowling will put the characters in a predicament and then invent some new magic that they can do to get them out of it
604813 stephenie meyer knows how to spin out the moral perplexity of growing into adulthood and making decisions youll have to face the rest of your life
604814 and she knows how to write a lot of adventure i was flipping pages wanting to find whatever happens next
604815 if you avoid expensive neighborhoods like this one youll do all right but the key is to plan ahead
604816 it wasnt like when your britney spears decided to shave her head for a new look
604817 the last time i spoke one of the girls during the question and answer asked me a question and i want your opinion
604818 she asked me when i was in the camp and i could see the smoke and i knew that it was the bodies of people and it could also be me did i ever get angry with god
604819 and i told them that i struggled with it then and i still struggle with it now in my struggle is how i continue to seek god then and now
604820 people told us wed never be able to raise the money we werent big enough we didnt have enough of a base but we persisted
604821 he saw what he did as a spontaneous gift to the city something that just happened like a dream i would never reconstruct any of that or let trickery intrude on that part of the film
604822 and that anything that happened in that part of the country could happen anywhere in the country
604823 to make it that much more of a social pressure cooker
604824 finding people who felt they needed to accomplish something if they feel that need in all likelihood their year will follow a dramatic arc
604825 all these people have sides that dont fit into the stereotype
604826 he knew i wanted to get his ideas and use his energy and engagement to bring his story to life many people in new york first encounter the tale of this frenchman walking between the towers as one in the family of new york stunts but its really about an artistic performance made possible by a conspiracy i always saw this as a suspense film a thriller
604827 he transformed an environment and in 1974 that environment hadnt quite been finished
604828 their interviews were very emotional detailed and fresh this was a big event in their lives probably the most exciting moment they ever had
604829 every film is defined by a series of choices my goal was always to tell this story as fully as i can and give people some of the joy and thrills i had finding out about it a more conventional documentary might have commentary linking what philippe does to childhood traumas which is equally interpretive and possibly more phony than putting on a really good show
604830 their disruption and violation of human rights to be put to rest so that the nation can move ahead
604831 if we are to become a first world country as you said in your resolution we have to put a stop to their ideological nonsense and their criminal acts once and for all our instruction our goal is they must be stopped by 2020 that is what we want to do
604832 in port irene yesterday wednesday i went to the cagayan economic zone i went to sta ana and i saw there thousands of jobs have been created in that cagayan economic zone that i visited
604833 i dont know how exactly this works but it does
604834 when you come to the border hold your card up to your window and on the border patrol screen up will pop your name your picture the fact that you are a u s citizen and the number of your card theyll peek in to see if youre the same person and speed you on your way
604835 are making noble attempts to preserve their natural assets create a user friendly infrastructure and build an economy where their citizens share the benefits of tourist revenue by bringing our commerce to such places we encourage their efforts and inspire neighboring countries to support these values as well
604836 were truly trying to preserve this history for future generations

604842 they come here to have a picnic with their schoolteachers
604843 it happens every spring and fall its a tradition its meant to give the children a day off and let them enjoy themselves with their teachers
604844 the spirit filled believer depends on the holy spirit to do what only the holy spirit can do
604845 i write when im inspired and i see to it that im inspired at nine oclock every morning
604846 the true function of a writer is to produce a masterpiece and no other task is of any consequence
604847 the writer when he is also an artist is someone who admits what others dont dare reveal
604848 the most solid advice for a writer is this i think try to learn to breathe deeply really to taste food when you eat and when you sleep really to sleep try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might and when you laugh laugh like hell and when you get angry get good and angry try to be alive you will be dead soon enough
604849 talent alone cannot make a writer there must be a man behind the book a personality which by birth and quality is pledged to the doctrines there set forth and which exists to see and state things so and not otherwise
604850 when a writer talks about his work hes talking about a love affair

604864 we will make a huge effort to bring up the clinical quality at dmc beyond anything what we have seen before

605164 mami senang yang kontolnya besar lebih besar dari aku punya atau yang kira kira sama
605165 oh kalau gitu ya si lud saja sebab dia punya panjang dan besar
605166 hwa kamu jauh berbeda dengan istriku yang kerempeng itu sedang kamu betul betul padat berisi sebenarnya sudah lama aku ingin menikmati tubuhmu tapi takut ngomong sama suamimu ternyata ada tawaran yang mengagetkan aku untuk ikut menikmati tubuhmu yaaah seperti ada petir disiang hari bolong rasanya
605167 waaah aku nggak tahan lagi nih pi habis sejak dalam mobil tadi lud terus mempermainkan dan meremas buah dadaku terus
605168 waaah pi pertama aku dirangkul dan diciumi oleh lud badanku rasanya mrinding dan panas dingin habis bulunya tangan dan kumisnya begitu geli rasanya waktu menggesek tubuh dan pipiku
605169 kalau nanti malam papi tidur sendirian bagaimana sebab katanya aku akan diajak tidur dengannya semalam
605170 nggak apa apa yang penting mami bisa keturutan mendapat kepuasan
605171 tadi lud bilang kalau nanti malam air maninya akan disemprotkan terus ke seluruh tubuhku dan memekku sampai habis dan lendir santanku akan dikuras sampai kering dengan kontolnya
605172 naaah ini untuk menikmati tubuh yang indah dari istri teman baikku aku harus bersiap supaya benar benar bisa memberikan kenikmatan yang diharapkan
605173 oh sudah seminggu lebih sejak istriku mens sebab kalau mens dia sampai 4 5 hari
605174 waaah kebetulan sekali nih sebab sekarang pasti air santannya hwa lagi kental kentalnya dan banyak nanti aku yang akan menghabiskannya dan kebetulan juga tanggalnya tidak pas saat subur nanti aku bisa semprotkan maniku sampai ke dalam mulut rahimnya hwa
605175 hwa apakah kamu tak bawa pakaian tidur tapi kalau tak bawa ya tak apa apa sebab nanti malam kan tak ada pakaian yang boleh menempel di tubuhmu sebagai gantinya tubuhmu akan kuselimuti dengan tubuhku
605176 addduuuh lud gila bener gesekan bulu atas bawahmu itu gak tahan memek dan buah dadaku kena gesekannya
605177 waduuuh lud santannya hwa mulai keluar dan kental sekali lud
605178 aku juga ngaceng banget kontolku disedot sedot dan dipermainkan lubangnya oleh hwa ayo kita ganti posisi
605179 masak toch padahal sudah kemasukan kontolku dan sudah ada santannya lho
605180 ini supaya hwa mendapat kenikmatan yang lebih hebat mau coba ya hwa
605181 waaaah kaya apa rasanya nanti lud aku belum bisa membayangkan tapi pokoknya habisi ya lud air mani dan santanku
605182 waduh lud pi rasanya seret sekali bibir memekku bisa merasakan bentuk kontolmu lud
605183 aduh pi kontolnya lud mentok sampai dalam kepalanya rasanya menyodok mulut rahimku enaknya luar biasa dan gelinya juga hebat kena gelang bulu itu
605184 pi lud tolong semprotkan semua manimu ya aku sudah pengin rasain hangatnya manimu sekalian
605185 mi gimana mami nikmat dan puas keinginan mami untuk merasakan dua kontol sekaligus terlaksana
605186 ya pi mami puas banget dan memang enaknya dan grengnya luar biasa sekaligus melihat memegang dan menikmati dua kontol apalagi ada yang gede gede mami jadi kepingin terus
605187 ayo an sekarang kita puaskan hwa dengan semprotan mani secara berbarengan
605188 ya pi bibir memekku merah kan itu gara gara kontol temanmu itu tuh yang seretnya bukan main mulai dari bibir memek sampai dinding dalam memek seret terus sehingga memekku bisa merasakan lekuk lekuk kontolnya lud
605189 wah pi maninya lud ngendon dalam memekku nih sebab tadi semprotannya banyak sampai tiga kali tapi yang keluar kok sedikit ya mungkin masuk ke rahim sebab dalam perutku masih terasa hangat dan saat nyemprot ujung lobangnya benar benar disodokkan sampai rasanya masuk lubang rahimku gimana ya pi
605190 biarin saja lama lama kan keluar sendiri sekarang dikeluarin juga percuma nanti malam kamu kan masih akan disemprot lagi
605191 bukan malam ini saja mungkin sampai besok pagi akan kusemprotkan sampai habis maniku ke memekmu
605192 betul lud biar kamu kembali ke rumah sama istrimu nanti sudah kosong tinggal botolnya doang jadi manimu dua hari ini harus dihabiskan sampai tuntas buat aku ya
605193 an kamu beruntung sekali punya istri dia walaupun sudah punya anak tapi buah dadanya masih berdiri menantang tidak jatuh juga perut dan pahanya mulus sekali tidak keriput siapa yang tak ngaceng terus lihat tubuh seindah ini apalagi isapannya juga yahut kalau jadi istriku tiap hari bisa kusetubuhi minimum dua kali
605194 sudah kesampaian keinginanku untuk melayani nafsu birahi dua laki laki sekaligus
605195 oya pi malam ini aku tak tidur denganmu ya aku akan melayani lud untuk menyalurkan nafsu seksnya sepuas puasnya supaya temanmu ini tak kecewa kalau balik ke jakarta
605196 boleh saja lud malam ini hwa biar melayani kamu supaya kamu bisa melampiaskan semua nafsu binatangmu padanya
605197 memang sejak aku makan di restoran sate kambing aku sudah minta supaya dia malam ini dan besok pagi melayani nafsu binatangku
605198 an sebenarnya aku sudah lama tiap kali bertemu dengan hwa aku kepingin menikmati tubuhnya ternyata malam ini jadi kenyataan untuk itu malam ini istrimu kupinjam untuk menemani tidur sebab aku akan melampiaskan seluruh nafsu binatangku pada hwa dan kontolku akan kusimpan dalam memeknya sepanjang malam aku akan memberikan kenikmatan dan kepuasan yang tak terkira pada hwa
605199 boleh lud malam ini istriku biar melayanimu agar kamu benar benar puas
605200 tapi kalau nanti malam papi butuh ya papi ikut masuk saja sebab mami tetap mau melayani papi juga kok malam ini untuk itu nanti pintu kamarnya biar terbuka saja ya jadi papi dapat lihat kami dan dapat masuk buat ikutan juga kalau mau
605201 malam ini aku benar benar merasa sehat makin mendapat semprotan mani makin sehat rasanya manimu tadi yang keluar lagi dariku baru sedikit lainnya masih berada di dalam rasanya masih hangat di dalam perutku say
605202 mi jangan lupa kalau maninya lud disemprotkan ke dalam mulut hati hati jangan sampai tertelan dan jangan mau kalau kontolnya di masukkan ke dalam lubang anusmu
605203 selamat menikmati kontol lud yang gede ya mi nanti papi dikasih tahu ceritanya ya
605204 aduuh lud aduh lud nikmatnya luar biasa aku sudah tak kuat menahannya lagi semprotkan manimu lud
605205 aduuh lud aduh lud enak banget kontolmu lud tapi aku tak kuat nahan nikmatnya lud aku butuh manimu lud kontolmu sudah makin hangat lud
605206 ayo oi jangan tidur saja mami mau disemprot mani lagi berdua berbarengan
605207 waaah pi maninya lud rupanya masuk terus ke dalam rahimku sebab tiap nyemprot tak pernah keluar lagi apa karena memekku disumpal terus dengan kontolnya lud ya pi sebab biasanya kalau punya papi paling 1 jam sudah mengalir keluar lagi walupun nyemprotnya keras banget
605208 gila istrimu itu minta disumpal terus memeknya pokoknya kontolku malam ini tak boleh lepas dari memeknya
605209 nggak pi lud yang minta dulu supaya kontolnya dipendam semalam suntuk dalam memekku dan aku setuju
605210 kontolnya terasa hangat terus di memekku dan kalau mulai tegang terasa mulai goyang goyang dan makin keras yang nyodok nyodoknya pi kalau tidur walaupun sudah tidur pula kontolnya tetapi kepala kontolnya tetap nyantol di bibir memekku jadi tak mau lepas seperti papi punya biasanya lepas sendiri kalau tidur
605211 aduuuh pi kontolnya lud masih menancap terus dalam memekku kalau tak ditarik tak bisa lepas sebab nyantol kepalanya
605212 mami tidak nelan maninya lud toch dan tak dimasuki lubang anusnya juga kan
605213 tidak pie semua maninya lud masuk ke dalam memekku dan sampai sekarang belum keluar sehingga rasanya ada sesuatu barang dalam perutku yang hangat lud hanya mencabut kontolnya kalau minta diisap setelah itu dimasukkan kembali ke memekku
605214 aduuuh lud aduuh lud enaknya kontolmu lud nikmat banget lud rasanya
605215 aaaach hwa memekmu juga nikmat aku kangen terus dengan memek dan payudaramu yang kenyal ini hwa
605216 hwa kamu jangan pakai bra saja jadinya lebih bagus karena kaosmu ketat
605217 aaah katanya mau keluar makan dan nanti kan mau pulang nggak enak kalau tak pakai bh
605218 kita kan hanya makan di restoran sini saja blm pulang sebab nanti aku masih mau main lagi sama kamu hwa lagian aku mau memamerkan kamu sama pengunjung restoran yang lain
605219 jadi bisa rame hwa kita main dua pasang dalam satu kamar pasti hot
605220 waaah maninya lud mulai keluar cd ku sampai basah dan lengket jadi tak enak dipakai mungkin rok ku juga basah belakangnya
605221 aduh pie maninya keluar lagi rasanya basah dan lengket semua pahaku cepat dikit pi
605222 papi sini lho lihat pie pahaku kena cendol maninya lud dan itu keluar terus banyak
605223 bh nya jangan dulu ya supaya papi lebih terangsang kalau papi mainan payudara mamie
605224 hebatnya lud itu sejak dari awal sampai yang terakhir semprotannya keras terus dan kental serta hangatnya dan banyaknya sama makanya rasanya penuh sekali dalam perutku tadi sampai suatu saat aku tekan perutku dan mulai keluar terus maninya
605225 mie kalau sudah habis cuci dulu vaginanya aku sudah nggak tahan nih
605226 waaah mie memekmu masih seret juga buat kontolku aku kira jadi longgar kemasukan kontol gedenya lud
605227 waktu kontolnya lud ditanam semalam suntuk dalam memekku begitu mulai kurang ngacengnya memekku mulai kurenggangkan sehingga sampai kepalanya saja yang nyantol di bibir vaginaku dengan maksud supaya jangan sampai longgar liangnya
605228 apalagi lud selalu pakai cincin bulu kuda itu waktu di dalam geli banget rasanya kalau goyang sedikit kalau di luar kurang gelinya sebab yang kena cuma bibir vagina saja
605229 kalau mainnya papi dan lud sama saja hanya lud kalau sudah nafsu banget agak kasar mainnya lain dengan papie tetap semangat tapi mesra hanya papi punya kalah besar dan panjangnya saja tapi mami mau belikan alat yang bisa buat memperbesar dan memperpanjang kontol tiap pagi nanti mami yang melakukannya supaya punya papi bisa jadi panjang dan besar
605230 memang saat lud mau nyemprot mami selalu tekan pantatnya mamie ke atas supaya kontolnya bisa ambles masuk semua sebab kalau nyemprotnya di dalam rasanya hangat enak dan nikmat papi punya kalau nyemprotnya keras dan kebetulan maninya agak encer juga bisa langsung kena mulut rahimku jadi hangatnya enak pie
605231 pie ini lho selain leher buah dadaku juga dicupang oleh lud tapi nanti mami gosok dengan minyak kayu putih supaya cepat hilang
605232 aduuuuh pie nikmat banget pie aku sudah kangen dengan kontolnya papi sejak papi minta tadi malam masih seret ya pie aku masih merasakan seret gesekan kontolnya papi pie mau keluar ya kok sudah anget banget kontolnya
605233 waaah maninya papi nyemprot ke dalam sebab semprotannya keras tapi agak encer bisa jadi satu dengan lud punya nih

605397 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me
605398 we need to take care of it for our tourism industry but the big problem is not on the beach its whats happening in the seas
605399 human caused stresses including global warming and overfishing are encouraging jellyfish surpluses in many tourist destinations and productive fisheries
605400 in the past few years the dynamic has changed completely the temperature is a little warmer
605401 creating a natural barrier that keeps the jellies from the coast
605402 im a little afraid to go back in the water
605403 right now i cant tell if i have hands or not they hurt theyre numb they itch
605404 there are more every year we saw hundreds offshore today
605405 you just have to learn how to handle the stings
605406 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
605407 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
605408 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
605409 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
605410 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
605411 its not really a problem i got it under control
605412 come on rick then whats with the warning signs buddy
605413 so youre in control of your power now thats good
605414 well i got to go mingle a bit have a good time at the reunion man
605415 no im too old for that now mostly i work for a demolitions company i help take down buildings and all that
605416 nah when i was working under the mask i was too busy now well i just dont know a lot of people how about you
605417 married twice and divorced twice i have a couple kids theyre off to college now and once the nest is empty it seems really empty
605418 of course an empty nest is empty what else would it be
605419 im happy enough i do honest work for fairly good pay i mean the money they save by having an indestructible exploding man blow up a building for them has to go somewhere right
605420 but are you happy not having been married not having kids
605421 i dont think about it very much sue my life well it just isnt normal i never had the same expectations as everyone else take kevin he was good at football and his big dream was to join a pro team he played a bit in college and in semi pro teams but he eventually settled into a middle management job at stuyvesant industries that kind of thing isnt really available to an exploding man i mean my vocation was pretty much handed to me at birth im an exploding man so i explode you know
605422 i wish i could have had that kind of direction in life i just feel like im like a butterfly flitting around from place to place without any plan when we were together it was different i had a dream we could have been something me and the exploding man imagine that
605423 we could have been something but we werent it wasnt meant to be sue
605424 we could be something still rick we arent dead yet
605425 im not drunk just a little buzzed im buzzed and im seeing clearly
605426 i need to go sue this was a bad idea
605427 after the israeli occupation refused to receive most of those who fled gaza dozens have returned and the palestinian police have taken them into custody
605428 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
605429 every year i just want to improve as a special teams guy or as a linebacker just to be a better overall football player
605430 every year thats my main goal just being an overall better linebacker better at what i do on special teams and at linebacker just getting better at that position
605431 hes an intelligent young guy and hes picking up the defense really well but were all coming in on a clean slate and have the same opportunity to make the team were both in the nfl now so im happy regardless
605432 besides just being another year under my belt theres no difference
605433 sometimes its not so complicated sometimes you come in and you dont know a lot of stuff but yes there is some familiarity from a year ago
605434 every day is a learning process and every season is a new season
605435 youre always learning year to year youre picking up a few things where you may be a little better than other people but every year theres always other stuff to learn
605436 basically its to never take a play off and everybody getting to the ball and when that happens you usually create positive situations for yourself
605437 yeah were disappointed in the super bowl outcome but its a new season and weve overcome it were getting ready for this year and were not worried about last year or what happened
605438 were still a veteran group with tedy bruschi mike vrabel and adalius
605439 it really hasnt changed very much were still good on the outside and at inside linebacker so im just looking to be on this team and to take on any role im given if its special teams thats great
605440 you might want to try talking to one of the other guys mate
605441 i hardly slept in the van and my minds not here
605442 but its a nice setting i think this is the first festival weve played in the middle of a city like this its quite nice
605443 i just ran out of gas with a few minutes to go there i wasnt even running on adrenaline at that point i was running on cells thats all that kept me going cells firing
605444 i wanted the crowd to burst into flames i wanted them to jump so high that they would break their legs when they land i wanted them to burst into flame so the skin peels back off their forehead and its just a skeleton jumping and dancing around really though i just wanted to entertain people to the fullest plus its chicago i had to bring it
605445 im already working on that youll have to wait and see
605446 unless we get together and help were going to cut it short
605447 it was bad up there i was right at the fence and people were pulling my hair back and pushing everyone forward
605448 ive seen rage two other times before and its never been like this
605449 but maybe ill stand back a little farther this time
605450 i think the country may well vote mmp out but i think they will vote in another proportional system
605451 i dont think theyll go back to first past the post
605452 i do think voters thought they were going to get an opportunity to kick they tyres and were giving them that opportunity
605453 national believes building better infrastructure is essential to fuelling higher levels of non inflationary economic growth for years to come
605454 the team has done a fantastic job of continually improving the car over the past few weeks so im really proud of what weve achieved today its great to have locked out the front row with heikki weve been threatening to do it for a number of races so to achieve it at a track where its tricky to pass is really satisfying theres a great harmony within the team at the moment and we really deserved this i couldnt ask to be in a better position weve both got good strategies for tomorrow and well be challenging for the win
605455 it was difficult to choose the right tyre for the final session and i felt i could have done a slightly faster lap in q3 but i was a little cautious in turn two still weve found a great direction with the car and ive got a great opportunity to win the race tomorrow its fantastic to be starting on the front row alongside lewis i hope that starting on the dirty side of the track wont be a disadvantage and i fully expect us to look out for each other in the first corner tomorrow this result really repays the team for all its efforts over the past few months
605456 its a shame i didnt manage to get the best out of the car in q3 mainly because of traffic especially on my second run in the first two parts of qualifying the car felt good as can be seen from my times but then i never managed to prepare the tyres in the best way clearly overtaking isnt easy but we have a good pace and i will try and exploit that in fighting with the two drivers ahead of me on the grid
605457 i am really happy with the result this was certainly one of my best qualifying sessions so far this season i was not expecting to start from fourth as the car has been quite difficult to drive over the entire weekend we struggled a bit with the balance but in the end i was able to make the harder tyre compound work very well and here we are i am now looking forward to the race
605458 that was a very good qualifying session for me and im obviously delighted we made a good start in first practice yesterday the team did a good job overnight and we made the right choice over set up it wasnt easy today because we had a very tight choice over tyres so we had to make a close decision for every lap but in the end my engineers stayed cool and got it right in q2 the car felt perfect then on the very last lap it was a bit trickier again because the tyres didnt behave quite as well but im happy with p5 we are in a great situation for tomorrow its good for all of us and after hockenheim this is the perfect answer for the faith i have in the whole team
605459 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again
605460 we knew that the qualifying session would be very close and that proved to be the case the first part was very competitive but we managed to reach q3 with both cars which is positive but i think the race tomorrow will be difficult thats for sure i will try and do my best to be on the pace and hopefully score some points
605461 that was a pretty good qualifying session quite straightforward it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us im disappointed im on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so well see how we go tomorrow
605462 im glad to be in the top ten but that was a difficult qualifying session and p9 is disappointing since this morning i have struggled for grip and balance and unfortunately we werent able to find the answers in time i had the same problems in qualifying so we will have to investigate that tonight im happy for timo who has done a good job this weekend and it is clearly important for us to score as many points as possible for the constructors championship overtaking is very difficult here but tomorrow is a very long race and we will see what we can achieve
605463 the session was very competitive and more difficult than i though it would be in the end i managed to reach q3 and i am happy about that it means we can approach the race sensibly tomorrow and i hope we can make the most of this grid position to score some points
605464 a shame to miss out on q3 by one hundredth but we expected it to be tight we can be happy though especially given i only managed nine laps yesterday it means we did a good job today now we can do what we like in terms of fuel load for the race and hopefully find a good strategy ive yet to do a long run this weekend but i think we can find a good compromise between qualifying and race pace and we have a good set up on the car
605465 im happy to have qualified in p12 today after a good lap on the final run in q2 pushed me a few places up the grid weve definitely made some progress with the new developments to the car and in particular the new rear suspension is working well and this has enabled us to improve the car step by step over the weekend i got the most out of the car today and its encouraging to see we were only three tenths away from the top ten as it has been a while since we were that close im on the dirty side of the grid which is a disadvantage but i am sure we can have a good race tomorrow from here nonetheless
605466 i was losing a little bit of time in each of the sectors and i couldnt deliver that last little bit of lap time because i was bringing the mid corner speed too low its tough from thirteenth for sure but the hungarian race can be unpredictable so lets see
605467 i struggled with the option tyre as it gave me no grip and i was sliding around more and had no feel for the car i was very happy in a well balanced car earlier on but after that im not really sure what happened i am disappointed because even if q3 would have been hard to reach i could not match my q1 time in q2
605468 we had a difficult start to this weekend but weve improved throughout the sessions and learnt a lot of things along the way we therefore werent looking too bad for qualifying i made a mistake on my fast lap in q1 and lost two and a half tenths in one corner so my q1 time did not show the true potential of our car we then had a good chance of making it into q3 but a hydraulic problem meant i couldnt go out at all in q2 which was disappointing its pretty interesting here tyre wise as both are very soft on this track but the harder ones were better for me today
605469 im totally disappointed it looked quite good at the end of yesterdays practice and also this morning but on my last lap in q1 i had four cars in my way most of them at least tried to give me room but it still cost me time towards the end of the lap i had one car in front which was on an out lap he saw me and accelerated he then overtook sebastien bourdais before the last corner and then sebastien was right in my way i was hoping it was so obvious he would be penalised right away and i could still get into q2
605470 it was a difficult qualifying for me aside from plenty of traffic i didnt really manage to find the right balance on my last set of option tyres both factors compromised my run we now need to go through the data and work out whats happening in order to get the most out of the car for tomorrow
605471 choosing which tyre to run was a really tough decision today and it was a difficult qualifying session i felt the supersoft option tyre was working slightly better with the car so i stayed with that for my final run after a good first sector i went in too quick for turn 11 and made a mistake which ruined my lap with that went the chance to progress to q2 and the time from my previous run puts me in 18th place on the grid the lap was going quite well but a mistake at turn 11 meant that i had to abort the lap i have to settle for 18th place today and turn my focus now to the race
605472 conditions today were tough but actually that was the maximum we could do the target was to do a 1 min 21 7 or 21 8 and we did a 21 6 so that was the most we could get out of the car the balance was not too bad but unfortunately the grip level is still very poor i think were not particularly quick round here and we have to accept that but we are still quite close we are to the others
605473 certainly not the 10 million that the article speaks about preliminary estimates place it in the 6 million region

605486 at one point i hesitated about finishing the building whether it was something i could handle
605487 but we had planned every detail of the showroom together and i knew that she wanted me to finish it ive been filled with relief and joy when it comes to this building this was a dream that was finally realized for both of us

605491 karen foresaw that i couldnt do this all on my own so she made sure i had some help
605492 i felt fortunate to have so many family and friends offer help
605493 karen was delighted when tom accepted because he is a mature talented person who really carried us when we needed him
605494 ive had so many people who really took care of things while i was trying to get back on my feet im almost there but havent quite reached it yet
605495 something i learned about this is to let people help you karen and i never sought out much help before but its part of the healing process for them as well it helped them while filling some of the loss i felt

605509 six of the boys were walking into town when three of them decided to get a run on three others dion nick and cooper were left behind and walking in at their own pace
605510 he was looking down at the river saying something to the boys and they told him to get down in a split second he fell
605511 they saw him mr cowdrey three times bobbing up and down in the river they did have contact with him yelling out screaming to him to get to the other side of the river
605512 all of a sudden he just went down and he never came back up
605513 they have no idea what the hells gone on how it could happen and theyre struggling to deal with whats happening theyre out on the water trying to do what they can to help
605514 we never give up hope but he hasnt been found well look every day the condition of the river is a factor and with the amount of water it may affect how soon he is found he may come up a bit sooner

605527 obama has not picked up any ground against mccain on foreign issues
605528 so if sen mccain wants to debate taxes then im ready i was just reading that wild bill hickok he had the first duel in the town square here in springfield and i have not done all the full research on this but the family legend is that wild bill hickok hes a distant cousin of mine so were going to research that cause im ready to duel john mccain on taxes right now right here im a quick draw
605529 the main thing about roosevelts appeal is hes remembered by most people as an image and a style
605530 sooner or later just about every republican who runs for president will invoke t r
605531 usually though they dont know what theyre talking about mccain is more serious about it i think hes got more justification
605532 a mccain white house will reflect the guiding principles of theodore roosevelt americas foremost conservation president
605533 john has shown immense amounts of courage that are certainly in the tradition of the old lion
605534 some critics in his day and ours saw in roosevelts patriotism only flag waving chauvinism not all that dissimilar to old world allegiances that incited one people to subjugate another and plunged whole continents into war
605535 but they did not see the universality of the ideals that formed his creed
605536 it goes to show that john mccain is someone who can appeal to anybody
605537 a rockin country song about john mccain and what hes done for our country
605538 it is not to barack obamas advantage to make this a big issue
605539 it is simply not acceptable to the majority of people including many of those who may be sympathetic
605540 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
605541 barack obama has played the race card from the bottom of the deck
605542 race plays a role in american politics in a lot of different ways its not just ku klux klan style racism
605543 when a large number of african americans decide to support barack obama on the assumption hed be a better vehicle for pursuing their interests thats taking race into consideration
605544 its simple these are three of the biggest celebrities in the world thats why they were chosen
605545 one of obamas big problems is that hes black and he does have a funny name
605546 weve had a little bit of that over in france with the corvette at le mans
605547 but this was good fun now ive got to make dale jr let me run next week when the nascar nationwide series goes to watkins glen
605548 the rain tire everybody had questions about it but it worked
605549 i dont know if i would have wanted to be out there on dry tires that were nine years old but the rain tires held up very well
605550 i felt like i dominated the race i feel really disappointed i felt like it was our race today
605551 this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof threaded with golden fire
605552 before and immediately after august 8 we will not see persistent heavy rainfall
605553 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers it is impossible to tell at what time the rain will fall on august 8 but we cannot exclude that there will be periodic rain then

605574 yeah and lets nail a broken security camera on top of the door so it looks authentic

605576 so whatre you gonna tell the clubbers who want to come in that its real exclusive
605577 better we cant open that door right so i let nobody in
605578 no name the club with no name itll create an aura of mystery
605579 hang in there v v maybe some senior citizens will think its a bingo hall and drop by
605580 if you build it they will come i have faith in this place
605581 if they try to break in should i call the cops
605582 you feel this power when youre a bouncer even if youre guarding nothing
605583 its the dark door they dont let anybody in someone says they saw someone famous walk in
605584 youre from europe arent you just arrived huh you sound british or french its new and like really exclusive ill bet they deal coke in the vip room
605585 ive been calling all my connections some ofem swear theyve been there already or know people whove been invited
605586 i have to put in a request it could take a few days
605587 i know this bloke who knows the owner you have to buy a place on the bottom of the list and only the top fifty on the list get in
605588 what only fifty people get to have the place to themselves
605589 no no the names on the list are shuffled around see its a complicated system but eventually everybody gets in and theres the entertainers know what i mean
605590 only fifty at a time doesnt sound like much fun
605591 so how does the bouncer know hell let me in
605592 the camera stupid you send in your photo with your name when your name is up you just look into the camera and they call the doorman who lets you in and youre made

605594 well now thats just enough turn out the lights already
605595 a most wise decision since having kotoko around ensures that chris will soon be a master of the doctrine

605599 maar iran zal niet afzien van zijn recht om een nucleair programma uit te bouwen
605600 lihat saja jepang yang tidak pernah mengeluh dengan harga minyak karena dia pakai mekanisme pasar
605601 itu baru sektor hulu belum hilir butuh waktu agar hasil di hilir bisa dirasakan
605602 namun ini akan sulit karena harga bbm subsidi tidak akan berubah sampai 2009 itu janjinya
605603 selama industri kita sangat tergantung kepada bahan bakar minyak bbm berarti industri kita akan terus direpotkan dengan biaya produksi karena minyak dunia memang akan terus berfluktuasi dalam kondisi tersebut mana mungkin industri kita bisa memikirkan daya saing
605604 semua jenis bahan bakar minyak untuk industri seperti premium solar minyak tanah serta pertamax akan mengalami penyesuaian persentasenya belum ditetapkan tetapi mungkin sekitar rp 200 00 per liter
605605 karena kalau yang sekarang kan masih pakai stok yang di kilang
605606 kenaikan rp 200 00 atau sekitar 3 an itu akan memberatkan industri kita karena dengan dampak kenaikan bbm tahun 2005 saja masih banyak industri yang belum bisa memulihkan diri sekarang sudah akan dihadapkan dengan kenaikan harga bbm lagi
605607 kalau yakin ini merupakan siklus biasa artinya ada kemungkinan turun kok belum belum sudah mengumumkan kenaikan ini artinya pertamina keder dengan situasi yang berlangsung dan saya kira pada saatnya kenaikan akan lebih besar dari rp 200 00 per liter
605608 pastinya nanti ada dampak pada pertumbuhan ekonomi kita intinya kita akan tetap mewaspadai dan apbn merupakan jangkar kestabilan ekonomi dari setiap negara karena itu kita akan mengamankan situasi apbn tahun ini ataupun tahun depan
605609 pengaruh yang positif dalam pertumbuhan ekonomi global saat ini pada neraca pembayaran maupun ekonomi kita tetapi di sisi lain ada dampak yang perlu kita waspadai yaitu peningkatan subsidi kalau harga minyak meningkat ini tentunya kita perlu waspadai dampak terhadap industri dalam negeri terhadap cost yang meningkat
605610 secara umum kita tetap optimistis tingkat pertumbuhan ekonomi tahun ini masih bisa dicapai
605611 kalau tidak artinya ekonomi global itu turun lebih dari yang kita perkirakan pastinya nanti ada dampak pada pertumbuhan ekonomi kita
605612 what is most interesting to me is helping people find something within themselves and then drawing it out
605613 study links drop in test scores to a decline in time spent brookings institute time spent on math homework doesn t help test brookings institute time spent on math homework doesn t help test
605614 thats what ill do it would mean the country wants to go backwards towards fear anti intellectualism i dont know i dont even want to think about it
605615 its totally possible were often in the situation where the democrat loses george bush was a terrible terrible president but karl rove was very sly and he put together a very mannered strategy that worked there are plenty of uninformed voters out there and all you have to do is scare them
605616 i would imagine that those voters are for the most part uneducated
605617 the media doesnt want to talk about race because you could inflame the issue
605618 the gop doesnt want to have this discussion either no one wants to have it
605619 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document
605620 you can see where theyre dipping the pen in to get more ink
605621 what the fuck was the point in him writing this
605622 that is perhaps why it touches me more because it is realistic
605623 its tough we hit every single play if we get up at 6 oclock in the morning were hitting at 7 you have to be a man about it
605624 we get together in the huddle and just say lets go
605625 coaches get comfortable with the guy thats there they get used to what hes good at
605626 you dont just have another guy show up and throw him in there and expect him to pick up where he left off thats why were out here for a month before the season starts
605627 eu sei do meu papel na sele o brasileira como principal jogadora mas n o sou uma estrela mundial minha fun o n o essa meu papel ajudar a sele o na conquista da t o sonhada medalha de ouro
605628 n o tem essa de marta e mais 17 jogadoras n o adianta uma jogadora tentar resolver sozinha que n o vai conseguir
605629 ha you thought he was going to die but he doesnt but then he does muahahahaha
605630 expanding and rising are fundamental desires of living beings blahblah
605631 wow hard to believe that ozma was once clean shaven and ranka could be lolier
605632 on an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak ones mind
605633 i dress like a rorschach inkblot test i have as much consistency as a revolving door they say i have too much of an imagination i say the world has pavloved me into retreating to my cotton candy thoughts whenever everything starts getting too crazy or worse too dull
605634 when you go to h amp r block and have your taxes done theyll buy your refund for a discount we do the same thing with real estate
605635 we buy the real estate agents commission many deals dont close for weeks after they are signed for a fee we give the agent access to that commission right away
605636 weve been flying under the radar since there are not a lot of people doing what we do
605637 there are a couple of small companies that are focused on the toronto area and a little bit of montreal but we do more business than all our competitors combined
605638 working on commission it can sometime be months between deals
605639 getting access to 80 per cent of the commission sooner helps fill in the gaps and the fees are reasonable
605640 they want consistent cash flow so they can do marketing and hire assistants
605641 my inventory is money if you have to tell a client in any business you dont have any inventory youre dead in the water
605642 our head office could be anywhere everything we do is by phone or by secure internet were headquartered in the valley because this is where i like to live it is very inexpensive to have an office here
605643 a hope for all humanity the first environmental city of the 21st century
605644 the american government has vetted us but theyre not behind us
605645 because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain
605646 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
605647 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
605648 we have identified around 3 500 of these temporary consents but we operate on a risk basis
605649 because most of these have not been identified as unsatisfactory and are low risk to water quality they are not a priority of ours
605650 at 2am we thought we were close to a deal we didnt seem to be too far away
605651 i believe that full advantage must be taken of this and of any other opportunities to make progress that may arise
605652 i am very disappointed with the outcome of the pay talks
605653 but it is indicative of the policies under brian cowen that are now quickly unravelling
605654 it is very worrying for the economy but not very surprising given the high cost high inflation situation mr cowen perpetuated as minister for finance we must now look to the suggested review to see if any progress can be made
605655 i have great sympathy for the people affected because it is devestating and frightening for a flood of water to go through anyones home but i am thankful that thanks to the prompt action of certain people nobody lost their life and nobody was seriously hurt
605656 hay que desdramatizar cada uno es responsable de las acciones pol ticas que realiza y no voy a adjetivar la decisi n del vicepresidente

605659 as youre carrying a m 16 door to door you live on an adrenaline rush
605660 nobody in the group gets more than five hours of sleep id say
605661 ive had combat veterans say bad things happen at night
605662 if thats something they endure everyday for 12 months are we surprised they come back with sleep problems
605663 the sleep disruption is so intertwined its not usually the only thing on the table
605664 if youre well rested youre better able to deal with the other problems
605665 the reality is that no one who goes to war is ever the same
605666 i havent gotten eight hours of sleep in five years
605667 i had a 5 year old throw a grenade in my truck the second day i was there my son is 5
605668 this is the first drug that has been demonstrated effective for ptsd nightmares and sleep disruption
605669 no as the real killers sivarasan suba and dhanu were already dead
605670 the real reason behind the meeting is still to be revealed by priyanka
605671 the meeting is unique there is no comparison in the world history priyanka and nalini do not know each other prior to the meeting it is unexpected for a daughter of a victim in a gruesome murder to meet an accused who had been sentenced with death penalty later on converted to sentence for life
605672 whatever may me the reason for not coming out with real reason for meeting the courage and the generosity of priyanka should be appreciated the outcome of the meeting in no way helps nalini
605673 it all depends on the arrival if it is delayed prices increase by a few rupees
605674 prices may further rise as supply from rajasthan is declining and freight charges of nasik varieties will add to the cost of the commodity
605675 the council felt that with the presence of foreign players local players have not been given the opportunity
605676 we are back to the drawing board our focus now will be development
605677 we are not at the status of the english premier league our league is not matured yet therefore some drastic measures must be taken to improve it
605678 many are having problems paying salaries and they cant cope so it is best that we do away with foreign players until the problems are solved

605685 foram precisos os psicodramas da universidade moderna e da universidade independente para que a opini o p blica tomasse consci ncia da situa o do ensino universit rio
605686 acum trei patru zile prezent la respargerea unor strazi am fost sa vad de ce trebuie am crezut ca sunt microfisuri dar era o lucrare pe 50 de metri si am avut curiozitatea sa cobor in pasajul universitatii dar nu am putut merge pentru ca erau gunoaie ca la marginea capitalei
605687 vom vedea pentru la anul si in niciun caz nu mai atacam haotic toate strazile sa ne injure toata lumea ca nu am avea un plan
605688 solutia este ca intr o luna vreau sa termin camera de coordonare care stabileste ce strazi se refac in 2009 vin si cei de la retele si apa canal si din momentul acela primarul general isi da cuvintul de onoare ca nu mai da nicio aprobare decat pentru situatii de urgenta ca ne prinde 2090 in aceeasi situatie
605689 the rocket attack was in response to israeli violations any calm deal must end israeli attacks on our people in the west bank too
605690 it depends on the assessment of the situation following tuesdays rocket attack

605693 schlie lich kam er ins fahrerprogramm von renault als er dort fallen gelassen wurde griff bmw zu allerdings nur weil alex wurz der eigentlich testfahrer werden sollte nicht ins cockpit passte k nnen und gl ck m ssen zusammenkommen
605694 heute hei t erfolg haben f r mich das beste aus einer situation herausholen inzwischen ist der rennsport f r mich noch viel mehr er ist eine lebensart mein ganzes leben dreht sich darum
605695 er hat selbst hart gearbeitet um etwas zu erreichen und jetzt hofft er dass ich das auch so hinkriege
605696 neulich habe ich mich mit meiner mutter zum einkaufen verabredet ich finde das sch n entspannend wir machen das jetzt fter meine ersten kochversuche haben auch alle berlebt
605697 wenn es so warm ist wie es in diesem jahr in australien oder in malaysia war dann ist das ekelhaft das kann sich niemand ausmalen wenn man im cockpit nichts zu tun h tte und nicht abgelenkt w re k nnte man das nicht aushalten
605698 ein formel 1 team ist wie eine firma und die piloten stehen weit oben in der hierarchie man wird sehr jung zur f hrungsfigur mit einem studium f ngt man wieder ganz unten an das stelle ich mir schwierig vor
605699 reducing our use of fuel is the responsibility of all members who operate a county vehicle
605700 of course this mandate is not intended to impact the performance of employees assigned duties
605701 in no way will we allow these cost cutting measures to negatively impact service
605702 for my dad it is a way of giving back to the community and the 4 h program that has given us so much
605703 the whole goal is to teach youths life skills they can use now and as adults
605704 because you can meet other people each year its more fun because you get a new cow and see what they are like and how they are different from the cow you had before
605705 i like how friendly they can be they dont get up when you lay on them
605706 they are really learning hard work and once the fair arrives they are going to realize how much teamwork plays a role its going to be wonderful
605707 i think im going to pet my cow and be as nice as i can
605708 nu e primul care i ncearc profe iile pe mine am nt lnit n carier mai mult de unul i niciodat nu i am luat n serios
605709 i think there are ideas that come out that you havent been exposed to before
605710 a year ago environmental issues were riding high now the economy has gotten so bad that a lot of environmental issues are way down
605711 we have to find a way to get across that these issues are inextricably entwined
605712 as a legislator its really important to understand what the counties are doing
605713 critical that were there to keep in touch with local government
605714 im the guy with one eye i should be the self conscious guy
605715 well excuse me for not having that natural ability to dress nicely i actually have to buy these clothes i cant simply make them like you can
605716 well given what your employers pay you i would think youd splurge on yourself once in awhile
605717 i did splurge on myself i got myself a new line of hawaiian shirts
605718 hey ill have you know that those were from the magnum collection
605719 gee why didnt you get a ferrari to go with it
605720 because your friend erik would probably trash it and then threaten to kill me because you didnt marry someone with the right genetics
605721 actually erik doesnt care either way about you its victor who wants to kill you
605722 yeah well its not my fault you had a past crappy relationship
605723 oh youre one to talk shall we count off the loves of xander harris
605724 this is nothing to be honest we really didnt think there was anything wrong with our marriage
605725 it sounds to me that you two might have issues
605726 every marriage has issues and were no exception whenever xander and i have a real fight we usually beat the hell out of each other in a dojo
605727 we usually work our frustrations out after awhile shes got this really cool kick thats kind of sexy until you get hit with it
605728 yes well we dont need to talk about that dear he really doesnt want to know about that
605729 but i have to tell you even faith would be impressed
605730 girls night out about a week after we got married
605731 you were dodging bullets and looking for that antique dagger in brazil
605732 oh yeah we got in a fight the night i got back didnt we
605733 oh yes and it was very good had me screaming for several minutes
605734 you mean to tell me that you have sex after every fight
605735 its kind of our way of foreplay given the life we live we always have a constant flow of adrenaline and danger going
605736 i hope so but i thought he would outlast the others it was almost too easy
605737 i just wish buffy and the others would stop trying to send us to these counselors our marriage really isnt that bad
605738 but still it is kind of fun messing with the heads of the various shrinks they makes us see
605739 i think they still think youre a demon and not a mutant
605740 turn it over turn it over everything is in it
605741 if i forget you o jerusalem let my right hand forget its skill
605742 i have always set god before me i shall not falter because he is at my right hand
605743 clarify that the israel they support is not the oppressor that lets settlers steal land and club women but the one that is a paragon of justice decency fairness and peace
605744 youre tearing my heart out by taking away my grandchildren
605745 our internet phone and web camera will definitely make communication easier its not like making aliyah 50 or even 25 years ago when some families spoke via telephone only once a month for a quick five or ten minutes
605746 vcu intenta facilitar la tarea de reventar contrase as a usuarios de ordenadores de cualquier nivel
605747 if we know this much about torture rendition secret prisons and warrantless wiretapping despite the administrations attempts to stonewall then imagine what we dont know
605748 you have to go back to the mccarthy era to find this level of abuse
605749 because the bush administration has been so opaque we dont know the extent of what laws have been violated
605750 we need a broad investigation on the way all the moving parts fit together it seems like were always looking at little chunks and missing the big picture
605751 copies of the main core or essence of each item of intelligence information on americans produced by the fbi and the other agencies of the u s intelligence community
605752 found that girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests
605753 talking barbie doll who proclaimed that math class is tough
605754 researchers looked at the average of the test scores of all students the performance of the most gifted children and the ability to solve complex math problems they found in every category that girls did as well as boys
605755 gender differences in math performance even among high scorers are insufficient to explain lopsided gender patterns in participation in some science and math fields
605756 girls and boys have roughly the same average scores on state math tests
605757 black beans mixed with fresh corn and olives and bulgur and some spices
605758 a vegetarian im not a vegetarian and you know why shouldnt i eat meat did you know our teeth were designed to eat meat besides i actually need meat
605759 i dont know whats going on on gossip girl or any other show so we should take a stab at some other conversational gambit
605760 why the hell do you think i care that you eat meat watch only the evening news and certain good dramas and okay sometimes jerry springer
605761 this is an attack on my entire lifestyle choice to use the pike
605762 so she has no opinion or knowledge about this and i should take a stab at some other topic
605763 theres a big part of contemporary conservatism thats based solely on doing whatever one things would make al gore a hippie michael moore upset
605764 we knew some people would say why are you wasting time doing this
605765 its important to educate folks about the humane treatment of animals
605766 see you cant tell the difference in these two particular products ed therefore you should only eat tofu from here on out and give up any silly immoral meat eating habits in fact the government should ban meat after all its full of trans fats and growth horomones in addition to being morally unjustified
605767 permission is to be sought thrice if it is accorded you may enter otherwise go back
605768 seeking permission to enter somebodys house has been prescribed in order to restrain eyes from looking at something we are not supposed to look at
605769 everybodys two or three paychecks away from being homeless so i have nothing against the shelter
605770 youd have to know corey if you complained that it was monday hed say only four more days until friday he was always always always optimistic in his heart he had a good soul
605771 we dont take kids with big problems like fire setters or sexually aggressive kids
605772 obviously we have to do a better job of letting the neighbors in and letting them know what goes on around here
605773 every patient who comes here you always try to do the best for them but you dont have a crystal ball were always hopeful that what we do can set them on the right path
605774 obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
605775 voters care about the military again dismissive of maliki suggesting that only he knows what the iraqis really
605776 if you lived in iraq and had lived under a tyranny youd be saying as mccain said in 2004 when asked if the u
605777 mccain knows best rejects malikis timetable but says i know what iraqis want
605778 ive met too many times with him and i know what they want
605779 it doesnt matter what they want i say they want what i want and thats that
605780 if you lived in iraq and had lived under a tyranny youd be saying
605781 when you my friends in iraq need an opinion i will give you one ok
605782 the climax must be a fight with the villain during which the symbiosis of good guy and bad guy implicit throughout must be articulated
605783 tim burtons interpretation of the batman saga especially batman returns will hold up somewhat better
605784 omg a mass market commerical movie can make a statement and christopher nolan is like totally genius
605785 how does someone like superman with virtually unlimited power maintain his astonishingly noble moral code when it seems likely that any real individual would be corrupted by that power
605786 just as we accept that there is an individual who can fly we also accept that there is an individual who is incorruptible
605787 over the long haul tim burtons interpretation of the batman saga especially batman returns will hold up somewhat better than nolans mega grossing effort
605788 yeah at least the first burton movie had nicholson as the joker nothing in nolans movies matches that
605789 the limits built into the superhero genre as it currently exists
605790 there is no doubt that the extraordinary work of our u s forces has contributed to a lessening of the violence just as making sure that the sadr militia stood down or the fact that the sunni tribes decided to flip and work with us instead of with al qaeda something that we hadnt anticipated happening
605791 i think that i did not anticipate and i think that this is a fair characterization the convergence of not only the surge but the sunni awakening in which a whole host of sunni tribal leaders decided that they had had enough with al qaeda in the shiia community the militias standing down to some degrees so what you had is a combination of political factors inside of iraq that then came right at the same time as terrific work by our troops had those political factors not occurred i think that my assessment would have been correct

605798 mccain the fact is we had four years of failed policy we were losing we were losing the war in iraq the consequences of failure and defeat of the united states of america in the first major conflict since 9 11 would have had devastating impacts throughout the region and the world
605799 no one has supported president bush on iraq more than i have
605800 the fact is that i have agreed with president bush far more than i have disagreed and on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
605801 to say that john mccain was aligned with president bush on the prosecution of the war in iraq is to change history
605802 among u s servicemen taken captive during the korean war as many as nine out of 10 survivors may suffer from post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and other mental disorders more than 35 years after their release psychologist patricia b sutker of the new orleans veterans administration medical center and her colleagues report in the january american journal of psychiatry
605803 this is just incredibly disturbing i have no choice but to conclude that john mccain has simply no idea what is actually happened and happening in iraq
605804 chalabi will take over and we can leave by august
605805 colonel mcfarlane phonetic was contacted by one of the major sunni sheiks because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others
605806 the fact is that in december 2006 the argument was between a change of strategy and
605807 there is no doubt that the extraordinary work of our u s forces has contributed to a lessening of the violence just as making sure that the sadr militia stood down or the fact that the sunni tribes decided to flip and work with us instead of with al qaeda something that we hadnt anticipated happening

605814 these subprime and alt a securities amount to 75 of equity but 95 are rated aaa providing a strong cushion from losses on the underlying collateral ing has largely limited its exposure to higher quality portions of the alt a market with the underlying mortgages carrying virtually no loan value ratios above 80 and no fico scores below 680

605816 the energy dependence rate is defined as net imports divided by gross consumption expressed as a percentage gross consumption is equal to gross inland consumption plus the fuel oil supplied to international marine bunkers a negative dependency rate indicates a net exporter of energy a value greater than 100 occurs when net imports exceed gross consumption in this case energy products are placed in stocks and not used in the year of import
605817 on the one hand repeatedly decreasing incoming orders indicate that germany s momentum will loose steam in the next six months on the other hand continuing price increases for energy and food are reducing the purchasing power of consumers furthermore loan conditions for companies should worsen as a result of the financial market crisis and the expected interest rate increase by the ecb
605818 the expectations of the financial market analysts are strongly influenced by the current forecast of a weaker economic momentum in 2009
605819 the upswing will lose significant drive in the coming 12 months
605820 leading indicators point to much worse news ahead on the manufacturing side of the euro zone economy including more recently in germany as a consequence the risk of a recession is increasing and unlike the previous downturn monetary policy isnt going to come to the rescue
605821 germany is on the verge of falling back into its old weak growth pattern for 2009 we see a notable trough in economic growth looming
605822 the data is really quite shocking the mood among the analysts has dropped close to freezing point
605823 the strong increase in the price of oil is the deciding reason for the worsening outlook
605824 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win
605825 employment in the service providing sector of the economy declined 3 000 the first decline since november 2002
605826 now who will protect the market from getting a false impression of the demand for our members securities
605827 we werent serious when we signed up for it it was just a bit of a laugh really expect plan c presently
605828 the idea that there are direct risks of contagion to the french property market from the year old us subprime crisis well deserves rejection indeed the mechanical selling obliging us households to take losses on their homes against a backdrop of collapsing prices oversupply and reduced demand has not spread however the financial and stock market crises which have since broken appear to have definitely affected the health of the property market
605829 the risk of subprime contagion is limited the usa is not in france
605830 in spite of a decline in prices of 1 0 during q1 2008 the market environment does not look positioned to enter a scenario of generalised price declines
605831 it is clear that so far the market is still in the process of stabilization

605834 over the years the united states has sent many of its fine young men and women into great peril to fight for freedom beyond our borders the only amount of land we have ever asked for in return is enough to bury those that did not return
605835 have you heard the latest dumb stunt bush has done he has sent an aircraft carrier to indonesia to help the tsunami victims what does he intend to do bomb them
605836 our carriers have three hospitals on board that can treat several hundred people they are nuclear powered and can supply emergency electrical power to shore facilities they have three cafeterias with the capacity to feed 3 000 people three meals a day they can produce several thousand gallons of fresh water from sea water each day and they carry half a dozen helicopters for use in transporting victims and injured to and from their flight deck we have eleven such ships how many does france have
605837 why is it that we always have to speak english in these conferences rather than speaking french
605838 wow i look like my irish cousin in that one
605839 youre kidding right this proves how bad it really is
605840 it is true that youngs rhetoric during a time of war was part of the backdrop against which the massacre happened
605841 a systematic effort to cover up and destroy records diaries and court records of the day
605842 we have got to give a lot of credit to the lds church for stepping up and owning the mountain meadows massacre
605843 this is something that has been swept under the rug denied and hidden for 151 years this book represents a real paradigm shift and thats remarkable
605844 we came up with the idea for the book ourselves we were not assigned to do it
605845 we sought the cooperation of church leaders to get access to information such as the first presidencys confidential collection but asked that we retain full editorial control and theyve honored that
605846 the trio of authors has properly tagged direct responsibility for the massacre on local church leaders and nauvoo legion officers with southern paiutes playing a minor role
605847 i give credit to the authors for this somewhat nontraditional view as well as their willingness to rescue the reputation of the victims from the appalling vilification thats taken place for 150 years they have also identified the impact of gov brigham youngs overheated rhetoric and provocative actions in helping to create a violent atmosphere in utah leading up to the massacre
605848 make obsolete previous studies and without doubt will constitute the necessary starting point for all future ones
605849 our marching orders as i understood them were to find the truth and tell it thats what we have tried to do
605850 my feeling is the best approach is to face it
605851 its a terrible sad story and a hard one to read we cant condone what they did but we can try to understand it good history brings you into the story in a way that you can understand yourself you should wonder what would i have done had i been there
605852 the decision means the case was not decided on whether mr grassos pay had been unreasonable but rather was thrown out because the exchange merged with archipelago holdings in 2006 becoming a public company the appeals court concluded that the attorney general has no standing to sue mr grasso since the exchange has been converted from a nonprofit entity to a for profit corporation negating the attorney generals ability to sue on behalf of the public rather than for private shareholders
605853 we do not want to do further damage to the zimbabwean people but when businesses are helping the mugabe regime they should reconsider their positions
605854 throughout this book you will find page number references in parentheses these numbers refer specificly to relevant information in

605860 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
605861 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
605862 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
605863 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
605864 hiv aids continues to be a public health emergency that has not received adequate nor appropriate attention as a nationwide priority
605865 to make measurable progress against hiv we need to know whether infection rates are going up which groups are becoming infected and which prevention activities reduce new infections
605866 we need a comprehensive national aids strategy with measurable outcome targets a timeline for action increased funding and a particular focus on those most at risk including racial and ethnic minorities

605872 looks like the past and present fed chairmen dont give a rats ass about you
605873 so long as the dollar weakness does not create inflation which is a major concern around the globe for everyone who watches the exchange rate then i think its a market phenomenon which aside from those who travel the world has no real fundamental economic consequences
605874 rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
605875 during today s town hall meeting in new hampshire mccain says oil executives told him we could see results from offshore drilling within a couple of years
605876 we have never had a secret vote in the two years of this parliament
605877 we dont consider it legal it is an effort to delay the elections
605878 see we told you so mccain lost because he wasnt sufficiently loyal to the right
605879 wish it wasnt that way but it is and always will be
605880 this is a clear choice that the american people have i had the courage and the judgment to say i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
605881 someone that went to a church that full of anti semitism and hamas loving and zionism is racism
605882 i had the courage and the judgment to say i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war
605883 are the gop convention delegates bound by anything or do their rules allow them to consider a do over it might be their only chance
605884 the angry one can try to paint the one as having bad judgment but who is being advised by kissinger the man who helped keep us in vietnam and get us into iraq
605885 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation
605886 these are the stakes to make a world in which all of gods children can live or to go into the dark we must either love each other or we must die
605887 vote for president johnson on november 3 the stakes are too high for you to stay home
605888 obama has been said that mccain doent care about the troops when his own son is in active duty
605889 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate
605890 i am thinking joe wet his pants when he viewed that commercial back in 1964 and now suffers from ptsd as a result
605891 this is a clear choice that the american people have i had the courage and the judgment to say i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
605892 has his own media outlets he can get his message out unfiltered through fox talk radio wsj and dozens of other gop organs
605893 the blatant media bias in favor of the messiah it is sickening watching these sycophants on tv drooling over the one
605894 nobody has batted 1 000 when it came to iraq
605895 donb dont forget to keep a fire extinguisher handy when youre burning things like crosses
605896 if you make racist statements like donb11 then youre a racist
605897 i cant decide on this because i dont understand it help me figure this out and then i will make a decision
605898 seven nominations on the shelf did this film direct itself
605899 this is a clear choice that the american people have i had the courage and the judgment to say i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
605900 there is a principle which alone is proof against all arguments and will keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation
605901 this word means this and that word means that so thats what this means
605902 i watched cnn read time magazine and debated on the internet then i voted for obama cause he said hed pull out of iraq
605903 i followed orders and blasted the hell out of a bunch of iraqis who never did anything to me or my country
605904 uh i didnt go because i thought the war was wrong
605905 this is not for oil because ive seen us drilling for water this is not for our empire but so that they can actually govern themselves because when they can we will be safer
605906 pelosis right though its too late for a surge instead of putting all its brainpower into surging the military should be focusing on how to get our conventional forces out and leave our unconventional forces in the neighborhood in a way that prevents an all out regional conflict
605907 for the record im outraged bush is ignoring the election results and the reality on the ground in iraq i think he is sending more young american lives into an impossible situation
605908 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
605909 the reality is that neither barack obama nor nouri al maliki nor most anybody else believes that the iraq war can be
605910 our media is run by people who cut their teeth on the my lai stories
605911 i do believe that each able bodied man of the appropriate age should look at his motives for sitting this out though if the answer is selfish then perhaps he should do something to serve it doesnt have to be in combat but there are a lot of people carrying the burden disproportionately
605912 it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency how sad
605913 the reality is that mccain should be proud that he helped salvage a disastrous situation by pushing the counterinsurgency plan its something to run on
605914 we will favor stronger currencies over weaker ones and will readjust accordingly
605915 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
605916 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
605917 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
605918 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
605919 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
605920 so long as the dollar weakness does not create inflation which is a major concern around the globe for everyone who watches the exchange rate then i think its a market phenomenon which aside from those who travel the world has no real fundamental economic consequences
605921 i could never have predicted the career ive had the good fortune ive had
605922 ive worked hard but ive also been in the right place at the right time it takes both it really does
605923 he had great presence in front of a jury and not everyone does
605924 and he didnt do it by being flamboyant he wasnt a screamer he was just very well prepared and matter of fact and focused
605925 with all due respect to my brethren in law enforcement we catch the dumb ones
605926 he should have had an independent counsel investigating this from the beginning and investigating all four caucuses
605927 and if its a republican its going to irritate me more
605928 i stand here and take it i know what were doing and were doing the right thing
605929 anyone who calls this a witch hunt is from neptune pluto or mars

605931 during all of this tournament i didnt play my best i congratulate him because hes playing well
605932 no one is unbeatable but the way he was playing we all thought hes not going to lose any time soon
605933 i tried not to think of his winning streak and what his new ranking spot will be i tried just to focus on my game
605934 it was my intention to have a fast start and to step in and go for it and in the second set i just tried to stay with him
605935 i played the best summer hard season in my life so im very happy for that
605936 today he played unbelievable in the first set in the second set i felt well and in some moments i felt i was playing better than him but finally he beat me
605937 the word formation means something that manifests when many conditions come together when we look at a flower we can recognize the many conditions that came together to make the flower manifest in that form the earth the compost the gardener time space and many elements come together to help the flower manifest the flower doesnt have a separate existence it is a formation
605938 oscars for people who consider the scorpion king to be the movie raiders of the lost ark could have been if itd just you know been made better
605939 to be a major central figure in public debates about what our cities should look like where tall building should go and try to put historic preservation right in the middle of those debates instead of at the end
605940 starting the organization was one of jordan phillips great contributions
605941 when we started the association laparoscopy was not part of residency training for doctors
605942 the market is terrible around the country the level of consumer misery is worse than ive ever seen foreclosure uncertainty about getting mortgages the collapse in home sales it went from such a boom to such a bust
605943 the rule of law has to return to real estate from borrowers to wall street
605944 people go back to diligence best practices back to basics with down payments and credit
605945 the multiple listing service is imploding as we know it
605946 as data becomes ubiquitous online dependence on realtors to find listings has changed dramatically
605947 our users go to real estate web sites why not serve them ourselves
605948 their engagement is high they come for the content 2 000 articles 1 300 videos and stay for the listings
605949 you see we have done it you can even see the mountains
605950 there has been an improvement this is unprecedented for this country
605951 this will be a way for china to show the world what it is capable of
605952 the first rule of being in business is being in business
605953 it is essential to lay the foundation of the bangsamoro homeland in order to address the bangsamoro peoples humanitarian and economic needs as well as their political aspirations
605954 if a peace agreement is reached that would send a positive signal
605955 but we dont have confidence of continuity of rules laws regulations they seem to be changed more or less at will and this makes investment very difficult
605956 lopez family is not in the business of bribing people in the pursuit of its businesses or to win cases in court
605957 olympism stands for the preservation of human dignity as stated in the olympics charter thus olympism also means respect for human rights it does not only mean excellence in sports
605958 internet censorship and the detention of people who raise human rights concerns in china are tarnishing the legacy of the games the cyclists join us in this view we have repeatedly reminded china of the human rights pledges they made during the bid for the olympics
605959 we have never called for a boycott of the beijing olympics we recognize the olympics as a unique opportunity for china to project itself as a nation ai is not biased against china we have campaigned on other countries that have previously hosted the olympics
605960 een achterlijke cultuur is het niet tolerant gewoon blijven steken in de zwarte achterlijke tijden zo rond het jaar 600 schat ik
605961 ik vind het gewoon kansloos en laag wat jullie hier doen jullie branden hem helemaal af terwijl jullie die man niet eens hebben gekend
605962 deze jongeren plegen bij wijze van spreken een overval en rechtvaardigen dit vanuit de islam
605963 ik had het over extremistische moslims en pastors scheert alle moslims over n kam eigenlijk zegt hij als er geen moslims zijn dan is er geen criminaliteit dat kun je niet maken in een functie als stadsbestuurder
605964 for the sequential read operations windows xp performed significantly better than the other systems for block sizes less than 8 kilobytes
605965 hij is een goede geestelijk leider die veel bruggen heeft gebouwd
605966 voortdurend de nadruk legt op het nastreven van een vreedzame samenleving
605967 we doelen dan op het illegaal aftappen van stroom en diefstal van apparatuur
605968 de sociale werkplaats heeft al een eigen kwekerij en alle benodigde kennis is daar in huis bovendien kunnen ze daar altijd extra werk en inkomsten gebruiken
605969 als de tweede kamer besluit tot een proef met legale teelt willen we hier best werk van maken
605970 wij zijn druk bezig om die afspraken na te komen maar daarvoor hebben wij tijd nodig
605971 ik heb de prefecten hoogste vertegenwoordigers van de staat in de departementen gevraagd die personen terstond uit te zetten
605972 mijn geloof verbiedt mij wetten van anderen aan te nemen
605973 juist de religieuze denkbeelden hebben geleid tot de aanname dat hij een terreuraanslag voorbereidde
605974 er kennelijk helaas in onze samenleving elementen rondlopen die niet weten wat democratie is
605975 moeilijk is om je tegen dit soort idioterie te verweren
605976 kennelijk helaas in onze samenleving elementen rondlopen die niet weten wat democratie is
605977 de rest is er buiten gehouden omdat het niets toevoegt aan het beeld dat je krijgt van de verdachte
605978 dat is heel zuur voor de mensen die gedupeerd zijn en genoegdoening willen
605979 zowel de gedupeerden als onze stichting zijn belanghebbende en worden niet als zodanig erkend wij willen gehoord worden en eisen inzage in de dossiers
605980 hij is gewoon ge nteresseerd in palestina in tsjetsjeni in irak en het is toch erg wat daar gebeurt dat zou toch ieder mens moeten vinden als hij zich bezig zou houden met de tweede wereldoorlog zou niemand dat eng vinden wat is beter interesse in de medemens hebben zoals mijn man of alleen maar bezig zijn met scootertjes en meisjes
605981 als ik bezig was met de poepluiers van ons zoontje zat hij aan tafel te knutselen gewoon met een soldeerbout ja nee ik vroeg hem niet w t hij maakte hij is altijd bezig hij houdt van knutselen daarom is hij ook die studie chemie gaan doen

605992 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
605993 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
605994 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
605995 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
605996 hasta ahora se pensaba que en un gran n mero de especies de peces igual que en los reptiles el sexo en los individuos estaba determinado por la temperatura ambiental y no por la informaci n gen tica este mecanismo que se conoce como determinaci n del sexo dependiente de la temperatura o tsd del ingl s temperatura dependent sex determination implica que no hay diferencias gen ticas entre machos y hembras sino que es la temperatura a la que est n sometidos los animales durante el desarrollo temprano lo que establece si un individuo ser macho o hembra
605997 en el peor de los casos s lo quedar a un 2 de hembras lo que compromete seriamente la supervivencia de la especie
605998 ya hay datos de una especie sudamericana el pejerrey una de las m s sensibles que sugieren que estos cambios ya se est n produciendo en algunas poblaciones naturales
605999 en muchas ocasiones lo que se hab a interpretado como determinaci n del sexo dependiente de la temperatura eran en realidad perturbaciones en la proporci n de sexos provocadas por unas condiciones an malas la determinaci n del sexo es predominantemente genot pica
606000 el csic se ala que el calentamiento global puede aumentar la proporci n de machos de algunas especies de peces

606036 semalam saya berada di permatang pauh bagi memberikan taklimat persiapan pilihanraya dan esok kita akan turun pergi semula ke sana bersama datuk seri anwar dan datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail bagi menjayakan majlis ceramah di sana
606037 kalau tanya saya sama ada saya bersedia untuk lawan anwar ibrahim saya kata sudah tentu saya bersedia dan saya tak akan tolak menang atau kalah itu bukan perkara utama tetapi yang penting kita tentang anwar sebagai satu pasukan untuk menegakkan kebenaran
606038 sebab itu saya kata jangan nak sebut dengan saya tentang kalah menang dan jangan nak takutkan saya tentang kawasan permatang pauh jangan nak cabar saya kerana saya antara pejuang dan saya akan lawan
606039 selama ini orang ingat anwar seorang pendekar tulen tetapi semalam dia dah tunjukkan sikap sebenarnya kalau betul dia pendekar kenapa dia perlu menyorok di kawasan selamat dan ajak orang bertarung
606040 kalau boleh saya mahu calon yang mewakili kami orang tempatan dan boleh berkhidmat di sini jangan ingat kami mengundi sekadar untuk sukasuka kami mengharapkan sesuatu berkhidmat untuk kami
606041 muda atau tua bukan persoalan kalau dah lima penggal jadi wakil rakyat tetapi tidak boleh bawa perubahan tak ada gunanya
606042 beliau dr wan azizah kata bertanding untuk berkhidmat kepada rakyat tetapi bila rakyat pilih belum sampai lima bulan dah letak jawatan dan ini tidak betul kerana dibuat atas kepentingan peribadi bukan ikut kehendak rakyat
606043 kalau boleh kami mahu penduduk tempatan kerana kami mahu pembaharuan dari segi pembangunan dan politik kami mahu pemimpin baru dan kami tidak mahu lagi berada di takuk lama
606044 kalau boleh kita juga mahu calon tempatan bila calon itu tahu tentang keadaan di sini lebih elok
606045 sehingga kini belum ada apa apa permintaan polis meminta beliau menemui polis
606046 anwar telah pun ditahan bulan lalu tidak perlu ditahan lagi
606047 menerusi surat kami bertarikh 29 jun kami telah memberi jaminan kepada polis bahawa kami akan memberi kerjasama kepada polis dan ini yang kami lakukan
606048 jika perlu polis boleh minta kami hadir menemui polis maklumkan kepada kami
606049 di sini ingin saya terangkan tugas tugas saya sebagai seorang

606052 terpulang kepada pembaca untuk percaya atau tidak atau cuba minta dsai anwar jelaskan sendiri sama ada benar atau tidak
606053 buat saudara saudari sekalian seperti yang dijanjikan saya akan melakukan sumpah dalam masa terdekat memandangkan siasatan kes saya ini seperti yang dimaklumkan telah pun selesai

606060 hasil kerjamu sungguh luar biasa saya sangat kagum dengan kemampuanmu menebang pohon pohon itu belum pernah ada yang sepertimu sebelum ini teruskan bekerja seperti itu
606061 sepertinya aku telah kehilangan kemampuan dan kekuatanku bagaimana aku dapat mempertanggungjawabkan hasil kerjaku kepada majikan
606062 mengasah kapak saya tidak punya waktu untuk itu saya sangat sibuk setiap hari menebang pohon dari pagi hingga sore dengan sekuat tenaga
606063 nah disinilah masalahnya ingat hari pertama kamu kerja dengan kapak baru dan terasah maka kamu bisa menebang pohon dengan hasil luar biasa hari hari berikutnya dengan tenaga yang sama menggunakan kapak yang sama tetapi tidak diasah kamu tahu sendiri hasilnya semakin menurun maka sesibuk apapun kamu harus meluangkan waktu untuk mengasah kapakmu agar setiap hari bekerja dengan tenaga yang sama dan hasil yang maksimal sekarang mulailah mengasah kapakmu dan segera kembali bekerja
606064 bapak ulama berikan pada saya obat agar hilang penyakit malas dari diri saya
606065 anak muda berjalanlah engkau ke pasar lihatlah orang orang yang bersemangat menjajakan dagangan berupa sayur sayuran buah buahan dan bahan bahan masakan belajarlah pada mereka insya allah kemalasanmu akan berkurang
606066 bepergianlah dengan menggunakan kereta di sana belajar pada orang orang yang berjualan makanan berjualan mainan serta menjajakan kerajinan tangan tanya pada mereka bagaimana menghempaskan rasa malas dari dalam kehidupan
606067 berikan saya cara agar bisa menghilangkan rasa malas dari diri saya
606068 kali ini coba bepergianlah dengan biskota di sana kamu bisa belajar pada mereka yang berjualan koran koran menjual barang barang dengan harga murah nian serta pada anak anak serta pemuda yang menjual suara secara sederhana dengan modal sebuah gitar dan kencrengan lihat semangat mereka rasakan rasa percaya diri tanpa gengsi mereka ketika mencari rejeki dari tuhan nya yang maha penyayang
606069 datanglah ke mesjid musholla dan tempat pengajian ikutlah berdoa bersama mereka yang menginginkan perubahan dalam hidupnya semoga doamu dikabulkan tuhan
606070 mulailah dengan mengucapkan bismillah kemudian pergilah ke hutan lalu kau potong sebuah pohon jadikan seikat kayu bakar kemudian jual ke pasar jika engkau bekerja dengan penuh keyakinan maka insya allah sifat malasmu akan berubah dalam sepekan
606071 alhamdulillah kapak itu telah membuka kesadaran saya ketika tiba di hutan saya memotong sebuah pohon namun ketika saya ingin membuat kayu bakar terpikir oleh saya bahwa meranti ini akan mempunyai nilai jual yang lebih tinggi jika saya buat menjadi sebuah kerajinan tangan kebetulan saya punya keterampilan membuat kaligrafi maka saya pun membuat kaligrafi dari kayu meranti kemudian saya jual ke pasar dan ternyata banyak orang yang gemar dengan penjualan awal yang cukup besar saya bisa membeli sebuah kios di pasar kini kaligrafi dari meranti ini mendapat pesanan dari luar negeri
606072 berapa lama lagi kamu baca koran itu tolong kamu ke sini dan bantu anak perempuanmu tersayang untuk makan
606073 sindu sayang demi ayah maukah kamu makan beberapa sendok curd rice ini kalau tidak nanti ibumu akan teriak teriak sama ayah
606074 akan minta sesuatu sama ayah bila habis semua nasinya apakah ayah mau berjanji memenuhi permintaan saya
606075 sindu jangan minta komputer atau barang barang lain yang mahal yah karena ayah saat ini tidak punya uang
606076 jangan terjadi dalam keluarga kita dia terlalu banyak nonton tv dan program program tv itu sudah merusak kebudayaan kita
606077 sindu kenapa kamu tidak minta hal yang lain kami semua akan sedih melihatmu botak
606078 ayah sudah melihat bagaimana menderitanya saya menghabiskan nasi susu asam itu dan ayah sudah berjanji untuk memenuhi permintaan saya kenapa ayah sekarang mau menarik menjilat ludah sendiri bukankah ayah sudah mengajarkan pelajaran moral bahwa kita harus memenuhi janji kita terhadap seseorang apapun yang terjadi seperti raja harishchandra raja india jaman dahulu kala untuk memenuhi janjinya rela memberikan tahta harta kekuasaannya bahkan nyawa anaknya sendiri
606079 kalau kita menjilat ludah sendiri dia tidak akan pernah belajar bagaimana menghargai dirinya sendiri
606080 anak anda sindu benar benar hebat anak laki laki yang jalan bersama sama dia sekarang harish adalah anak saya dia menderita kanker leukemia
606081 thats because at least with scheduled load shedding theres a way to gracefully shut down servers and other critical infrastructure and safe guard data from loss with intermittent power issues and no idea when interruptions will take place ups solutions are going to become even more important
606082 i therefore believe that looking longer term all businesses should continue investigating alternative power generation methods
606083 since each of them has its own benefits and drawbacks they should be investigated in detail before a decision is made
606084 and since the oil price is climbing at a rate of knots having to refill fuel tanks with diesel is proving to be a more and more costly affair if the diesel price continues to climb it may render generators the least cost effective option in the long term
606085 those that have the space and capacity must also bear in mind that it takes a fair amount of investment to build such a power solution it is therefore only viable for companies that want a long term solution
606086 as there is a bigger demand for batteries than ever before and it could put huge pressure on lead resources thereby rendering batteries a scarce commodity

606090 we hadden wel beter gekund maar we hadden zaterdag een vliegtuig te halen naar peking
606091 maar we zijn tevreden van ons toernooi we hebben sterk gespeeld
606092 het is goed dat we deze week al op het zand kunnen trainen waar de wedstrijden zullen gespeeld worden daarom beslisten we ook om niet naar yantai te gaan waar het boic een stagekamp heeft ingericht nvdr het zand zou er heel hard bij liggen dus het is belangrijk dat we er al kunnen op trainen

606101 at ourstage our mission is to help talented artists achieve critical exposure by solving the greatest challenge on the internet today sorting quality content from the sea of mediocrity online
606102 ourstage does this by providing a game free platform allowing fans to experience music and drive the best to the top
606103 with so much bogus manipulation going on regarding social networking sites today we look for signs of sincere growth in many areas
606104 i was following the band online and their chart ranking over an extended period on ourstage convinced us that the support and demand for this band was real and tangible
606105 when ourstage sent plushgun to sxsw they gave me the opportunity to see the band live which sealed the deal on our end
606106 in order to build a real success story you have to be willing to invest in the development of an artists career and were thrilled that theres finally someone out there that shares our passion and commitment and can step up as a partner when the talent is there
606107 tommy boy is a legendary record label that has always taken chances when it comes to new artists ranging from afrika bambaata and de la soul to rupaul and fannypack
606108 with the internet permanently changing the way music is discovered and distributed we are excited not only to support talented emerging artists but to work with creative partners like tommy boy that can help us deliver this music to the fans
606109 he saw what he did as a spontaneous gift to the city something that just happened like a dream i would never reconstruct any of that or let trickery intrude on that part of the film
606110 and that anything that happened in that part of the country could happen anywhere in the country
606111 to make it that much more of a social pressure cooker
606112 finding people who felt they needed to accomplish something if they feel that need in all likelihood their year will follow a dramatic arc
606113 all these people have sides that dont fit into the stereotype
606114 he knew i wanted to get his ideas and use his energy and engagement to bring his story to life many people in new york first encounter the tale of this frenchman walking between the towers as one in the family of new york stunts but its really about an artistic performance made possible by a conspiracy i always saw this as a suspense film a thriller
606115 he transformed an environment and in 1974 that environment hadnt quite been finished
606116 their interviews were very emotional detailed and fresh this was a big event in their lives probably the most exciting moment they ever had
606117 every film is defined by a series of choices my goal was always to tell this story as fully as i can and give people some of the joy and thrills i had finding out about it a more conventional documentary might have commentary linking what philippe does to childhood traumas which is equally interpretive and possibly more phony than putting on a really good show
606118 i dont feel bad i just feel very sad ive lost a super yacht that was less than a year old
606119 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
606120 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
606121 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
606122 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
606123 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
606124 one of the most pernicious writers is steven plaut a man who could be thought of as israels daniel pipes

606126 hadmi will not be returning to the laboratories or to the university the hebrew university has agreed to review his thesis to determine if he is eligible to continue on to a phd but he has been specifically barred from the laboratory due to security considerations
606127 according to the law even ex cons must be given the opportunity to educate themselves and so we have agreed to examine his written work without allowing him into the university

606137 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
606138 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
606139 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
606140 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things

606160 no untoward incident has been reported from any where in the region sunday
606161 the slurry should have been embedded towards the direction in which the waves travel during an explosion in this case it was placed exactly the opposite way and thats why the damage was less the bomb expert said
606162 this becomes very crucial during the next operation to defuse bombs as bomb squad personnel could be exposed to danger
606163 this bomb was probably made some years ago the container used is a tin box of a gutka company the police also recovered some safety fuse this has the potential to kill one or two human beings that too when thrown into a mob experts said

606173 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
606174 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
606175 the choice is and was always between gb running as the change candidate or as continuity nl new labour

606187 you dont just go out and needlessly shop as a hobby its really kind of an eye opener
606188 all that was money out the window we could not keep going like that and make ends meet
606189 people are coming for all different reasons with credit card debt or others who say my kids are so materialistic and out of control
606190 the real surprise is that its so much easier than you would think
606191 if you hang on its like dieting the hunger goes away
606192 i dont see that as being bad for the economy
606193 there are different levels of adherence its what makes sense to your economic or personal conditions
606194 on motion that the house agree with an amendment to the senate amendment to the house amendments to the senate
606195 legislators in both the house and senate are getting ready to put through the mother of all mortgage bailout bills
606196 socially responsible investing somewhat lies in the eyes of the beholder
606197 natural gas is far more efficient and environmentally friendly than fuels like coal so where we can we take the more environmentally friendly fuel
606198 put a trojan back door of your choice on the target could be netbus could be beast make sure you have snort running
606199 the only thing we really have in common is our desire to never stop learning how these systems work
606200 you can never get away for any length of time
606201 being able to escape to a place thats all inclusive like this is a godsend you get to play with other geeks for a week its like a geek playground
606202 i know our natural tendency as security people is to try to protect ourselves
606203 if you ask 100 people for their passwords youll eventually get 10
606204 a lot of this stuff is invented by college kids fresh off dungeons and dragons and hopped up by 16 hours of mountain dew
606205 and he wanted to take documents to his new company it was software so it was easy to detect those were trade secrets so he did get prosecuted
606206 we decided to leave it on and put up a camera
606207 he suspected the man was having an affair with his wife
606208 we would be very interested in assets that arent core to wachovias business
606209 i think youll see a lot of that over the next six to 12 months
606210 i cant imagine that markets like philadelphia would ever be considered noncore by wachovia
606211 they should sell their new york city locations where they have been a total failure
606212 i think from new york south theyre pretty well entrenched
606213 those deposit franchises have a lot of value but my guess is when wachovia talks about the northeast they mean new york and new england from philadelphia they have such a good earnings stream they dont want to cut that off
606214 we missed out on the upside that many of the big new york firms were getting but we dont face the downside either
606215 we are monitoring our business very closely and within a reasonable degree of tolerance revenues are tracking very closely to where they were in 2007
606216 we are simply a little less subject to market volatility for better or for worse
606217 we are all worried that the next deal is not coming in but so far they are coming in
606218 when you see big layoffs and every speck of news that you read is negative it is surprising to see things going up
606219 the problem is that people buy a fund after the manager has proved that they are a high performer but they sell the first time theres a problem
606220 they wind up chasing performance buying high and selling low instead of sticking with a manager who has proved that they can deliver if you give them enough time
606221 that they can dig out of a hole because you have to believe they can create return fast enough to help you catch up from any down period you want them to be able to live up to the expectation you had for the fund when you first bought it which means you have to believe they can get performance back to what you expected over time
606222 when a manager loses conviction in what they are doing thats a problem
606223 i think there are ideas that come out that you havent been exposed to before
606224 a year ago environmental issues were riding high now the economy has gotten so bad that a lot of environmental issues are way down
606225 we have to find a way to get across that these issues are inextricably entwined
606226 as a legislator its really important to understand what the counties are doing
606227 critical that were there to keep in touch with local government

606232 my uncle loved to say you can keep throwing these departments out and send the customer down the mall to somebody else or across the street to somebody else

606237 gt sawah abu saif the cameraman man working for germanys ard public broadcaster and ard charges that he was tortured afp reports
606238 we was questioned about the work of ard they wanted to know everything about the staff and correspondents and why ard reported so much negative news about hamas
606239 if hamas wanted to know while interrogating saif why ard reported news that was supposedly negative about it they certainly gave us another reason to do it
606240 claro que animo a las parejas casadas a rezar para que tengan una buena y feliz vida sexual para ellos es un medio de acercarse a dios
606241 la gente est un poco sorprendida al principio pero agradablemente sorprendida
606242 si crees en dios crees que dios est presente en la vida en el amor en el matrimonio y en la sexualidad parece natural hablar de sexo y suprimir algunos tab es y etiquetas del pecado

606248 hes been a guy who has needed a little adjustment time as he has moved up levels
606249 we wanted to get him to triple a and have him make his adjustments in august rather than out of spring training next year
606250 weve got some guys who think hes a three or a four
606251 i think he can be better than that i think guys mature people forget hes only 21 and with maturity he could get better i think he could be a legitimate no 2

606256 give police the power of arrest and add criminal penalties to arrests the state has to give cities and towns greater powers to enforce restrictions
606257 i would like to see city council posting them on city bulletin boards
606258 you go into a park and here are all the people you should be wary of
606259 a 12 year old is going to accurately remember what a photocopied image looked like while walking along the street
606260 there are so many possibilities for things to go wrong
606261 these measures are essentially trying to punish people for life
606262 if i have to sacrifice one sex offender for one student when you reach the level of a level 3 sex offender thats a lifelong tag that you elected to put on yourself
606263 i didnt buy that especially in new hampshire you might be able to drive someone underground in boston or new york but not new hampshire
606264 people who are in positions of power are becoming more educated to the real impact of these ordinances theyre not promoting them theyre not advancing them
606265 the only reason why selectmen come up with residency restrictions is out of frustration that legislators arent doing anything
606266 the laws that are supposed to protect us are not working residency restrictions are the only thing a town can do
606267 i think people will now see sex offenders getting time for crimes
606268 la base genetica che fa sentire le donne appartenenti allaltro sesso
606269 we wanted to take another look at it to avert problems before enforcement
606270 putnam county is committed to protecting children from dangerous offenders through a process that is efficient practical and constitutional
606271 recent court decisions concerning similar child safety laws in sister jurisdictions have prompted us to review our local law to ensure that it satisfies all those requirements
606272 people can challenge any law on the books i would rather have a law in force that is tough and let a judge throw it out
606273 there would have been no place in putnam county where i would have been able to place someone
606274 i think the law is necessary to keep our children safe
606275 i moved up here from throgs neck to give my children a better life so they could play in the backyard
606276 i was shocked when i found out putnam doesnt have a child safety law
606277 bundesfamilienministerin ursula von der leyen cdu hat gestern einen gro en topf spaghetti gekocht
606278 it feels good to behave the way i want to behave out there
606279 it was fun to pitch here because it was a reminder of good times
606280 for me its about focusing on what i do not the results it was like pitching in little league again when you didnt have to worry about contracts and things
606281 when he told me he felt fine it was his ballgame at that point
606282 we have all the confidence in the world in barry
606283 to go eight innings that was very very impressive this guy can pitch
606284 when you go up against peavy especially in san diego you know its going to be a battle
606285 the key is to get that out of my head that im facing peavy
606286 we just have to play better everybody has to play better myself included
606287 zito was solid out there tonight very much in command
606288 that was something im not really sure what happened but thats a done issue thats something that obviously people hear stuff im here practicing waiting obviously cant wait till the season starts
606289 it caught me off guard because hes 29 years old
606290 id had a couple of conversations with him and it seemed like there might be something going on so he came in and sure it was a surprise
606291 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it
606292 im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
606293 why wouldnt i im with a new team a great bunch of guys as far as me being young thats a done issue thats far from my mind im looking forward to getting this season on the road and actually looking forward to going into next week and try to put everything together as a team and as an offense
606294 a lot has happened from signing a big contract in 2006 with denver to being injured being released in 2007 signing another big contract las vegas
606295 and im sure hes been a little disappointed in his play out here and battling back from injuries theres a lot going on in his mind
606296 he did that on his own come out and get some work
606297 the way the game was going that could have been a wrap
606298 dans certains cas la violence qui se d chaine est lexpression dune autre violence qui ressurgit dun pass fait dabandons de traumatisme ou de profondes carences
606299 on navait m me pas attendu freud pour imaginer que des carences affectives pouvaient laisser des traces de l justifier un acharnement par ces seuls aspects est risible pas de r ponse la question z ro point
606300 certains narrivent pas r aliser la violence et lintensit de ceci parfois un acte violent peut se retracer partir de la violence dune histoire personnelle ou familiale ce qui nexcuse rien mais permet de rechercher une esquisse de sens
606301 si la col re qui peut saisir tout un chacun peut surprendre par son intensit et sa violence les interdits que nous avons int rioris s prot gent la plupart du temps contre des actes plus graves
606302 thats kind of what our guys said he could do for us when we picked him up
606303 he had four pitches working and he could throw them at any time thats why he had success and will continue to have success
606304 at bats like that can make or break a game if he gets a hit or drives the ball there he could give them some momentum i just wanted to make good pitches there
606305 it was nice to throw a good game not only for me personally but more importantly for the team we have two months left and we have to get wins
606306 the sfa covers the entire range of bilateral relations including economic cultural diplomatic etc the sofa covers military cooperation
606307 would allow the united states to continue military operations in iraq until an sofa could be completed
606308 i am not sure whether this will happen during either administration but if iraqs demands are met then we may reach a protocol or a sort of agreement
606309 we are not going to sign a treaty this is unlikely
606310 i started the ico project ueda san joined my team in japan as a cinematic animator but he created a short movie and presented it to me and said i want to make this game
606311 i said yes lets do it but you have never made a game
606312 the focus of this debate should be upon how the australian classification system can best give adults the information they need to chose video game content for themselves and their children without burdening our country with unjustified and draconian censorship to the amusement and pity of the rest of the world
606313 we can start with the immediate implementation of an r18 games rating
606314 on one hand australia is an oasis of game development with a thriving highly skilled industry generating hundreds of millions of dollars of valuable export revenue
606315 on the other hand australias lack of an r18 classification means that some of the worlds most important video games are effectively banned from appearing down under at all
606316 the particularities of culture language and tradition are gods gifts to us for they define who and what we are
606317 but we also need to foster openness towards those who are different the peoples and nations of our divided world
606318 tartis city is not the big shux ive said to much ok anyways moving along
606319 now you shall say to this people thus says yahweh
606320 it shall be given into the hand of the king of bablyon and he shall burn it with fire
606321 i will bless those who bless you and i will curse him who curses you and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed
606322 we know you are a false prophet because god gave us this land and we have a right to defend it and therefore we will not defect to the bablyonians but we will fight against them
606323 israel has a right to the land for god gave it to them and therefore they have a right to defend themselves against their muslim enemies against hamas hezbollah and their other arab enemies
606324 im confident that by showing respect to the people to the olympics it will put me in a position to continue to have frank and candid discussions
606325 this is an enormous show of face gesture of face from the president to actually go to the olympics
606326 this is chinas international coming out party in many respects the olympics so its an enormous thing
606327 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
606328 were always thinking what do we need to do to get more kids playing
606329 thousands of girls jump rope but they do it as a recreational sport just for fun for it to be in the schools that means its getting good recognition as a sport
606330 you have to do an aerial which is like a flip
606331 you have to do a rapid dance with some fancy footwork you have to do a rope trick and you have to do a cheer an ending that your whole team takes part in
606332 double dutch is a sport that gets girls involved no matter what their condition is
606333 jumping double dutch was one of the requirements of being outside
606334 i can still see her sitting there in her stroller with those beautiful soulful brown eyes smiling and responsive so trusting so vulnerable
606335 i asked about school and danieals last visit to the doctor and the mother said she hadnt had the resources to take care of those things yet the girl had been in her care for nine months after visiting her father in arizona she had had nine months
606336 she was a child a child i met and now she is gone for no good reason at all
606337 it was terrible terrible and in our office when that happened we considered her everyones child and everyone was depressed
606338 there were a lot of people who fell short on what this child needed
606339 if even one level of that had worked it might have turned out different
606340 administrators need to exhibit the same sense of responsibility and urgency that dhs employees such as trina jenkins and catherine mondi displayed
606341 and i was just like look im going to help this woman ive got a family thats in need of help so let me just give her the help she needs
606342 the girl had not seen a doctor had not started school and had received no services for her disability
606343 a new phase of life thats emerging between the end of midlife career and real old age
606344 like working retired thats kind of like walking dead nothing aspirational about it encore career is a radically optimistic notion you wont make more money or become more famous but you might be doing the most essential work of your life with heart and soul
606345 life skills compassion are as important as a pile of letters after your name
606346 the bridge from midlife careers to encore careers remains almost invisible to many
606347 i think most people parents and children appreciate the choice
606348 you can decide what school you want to attend and that appeals to people
606349 if you run a good operation then you make a profit but you wont get any students if you are bad
606350 you have to do a good job to get money that is even more important for a private school
606351 a beacon being more marketlike than any other among rich countries
606352 its not a very marketlike program but since its the best thing around in the rich world its definitely worth watching
606353 it is a model that is clearly working and we need to learn from that
606354 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
606355 the ruling dynasty is under pressure to show its population that the oil money is being reinvested for the good of the people the al sauds have suffered from the image of a ruling family as corrupt and spending lavishly
606356 the stone age did not end for lack of stone
606357 are part of a broader effort to diversify the economy away from oil and away from its reliance on the public sector the cities are intended to develop more of a non oil economy well before the oil runs out
606358 when there was money it was easy to absorb young saudis into public jobs but the population kept growing and the local education system did not produce enough candidates for the local job market that caused resentment and allowed militant groups to launch against the local dynasty
606359 were not anymore an isolated island we realize the challenge today in order for us to be more competitive means more transparency and more gender equality
606360 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
606361 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
606362 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
606363 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
606364 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
606365 no hace falta el que se fue sino el que vendr
606366 mi vida y mi pensamiento constituyen una sola cosa un unico proceso y si algo espero que me sea reconocido es el de meter toda mi sangre en mis ideas
606367 i told my husband learn from him mohannad how he treats her how he loves her how he cares about her
606368 we are a little more open not as conservative as some of these countries and i think this might have some appeal for the audience
606369 this series collides with our islamic religion values and traditions
606370 every student of writing in the country needs this book
606371 like his novels houses play shows a deep sense of place and humanity
606372 husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
606373 your old enough to understand your father didnt love you without being ridiculous youre being ridiculous drinking is a sin go home to your wife i raised you better than that
606374 we are talking arent we now please shut up okay
606375 this part of my life this little part it called happyness
606376 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
606377 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
606378 they have to settle all their differences otherwise it will lead to a crisis in all iraqi cities
606379 i dont feel bad i just feel very sad ive lost a super yacht that was less than a year old

606391 ning n coleccionista compra en el vac o tener informaci n es fundamental
606392 no puedes ser un coleccionista si lo que haces es mirar un poco a ver qu hay y luego eliges cosas
606393 lo ltimo que quieres es hacer que alguien compre cosas que te apasionan a ti porque ah el proceso se termina y se transforma en cons gueme un damien hirst tr eme un warhol y eso no es coleccionar

606397 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
606398 at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
606399 tony blair continues to be 100 percent supportive of gordon brown and the government
606400 the choice is and was always between gb gordon brown running as the change candidate or as continuity nl new labour
606401 by trying to be change he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term in office
606402 its been a pretty decent weekend for us so far and i feel safe with the position were in
606403 the team have done a great job in improving our car even from the last weekend and it would be great to get a 1 2 on sunday it would be about time
606404 i wasnt 100 percent happy with my laps in q3
606405 i went out on the track at a little bit of a wrong time when there were too many cars around
606406 that made it really tricky for the preparation of my tyres but i think our lap times from the first two qualifying sessions showed that we are pretty strong
606407 i definitely have the feeling we can push these guys tomorrow

606422 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organization including having ties with israel
606423 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
606424 if people are worried that because im taking over doctor who its going to be really really frightening well then tough
606425 id love to play him hes one of my favourites and there are some things in the pipeline
606426 mmmm impressive but no thanks i already have a sharpie
606427 we wanted to break the format and do something different particularly after how powerful the climax was with the death of two major characters
606428 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
606429 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
606430 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
606431 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right
606432 id be in a mall or wherever and people would come up saying ive never cried so much
606433 but there is a tiny part of me that kind of prefers she does stay dead
606434 its a big show for bbc america and its a show they are really proud of and it works really well i dont exactly know what that means in physical numbers but it gets a lot of airtime and it gets a lot of coverage
606435 because susannah had always had the sense that she was a supporting character in her own life and it was awful awful awful to know such a thing to have always been part of someone elses story to flail for a way to escape it to have to work so hard so late in the game to discover what she was on her own
606436 it was a place like the face of the moon though it had once been inhabited by people animals things a track mark snaking through the ground might have been an ancient snails path nearby roared an oceany sound looking hard enough you could see the evidence of the world that had been and you did look and hard like a dog surveying a park for another dog because you wanted to see something of yourself in the desiccated landscape because you wanted to believe that the world had a pattern an order to make sense of
606437 ten bucks ok with you anything else here catch your fancy
606438 i might be driving west from new york on my way back from paris because the melons are in season in fresno and ill send you a postcard and say im on my way

606440 you think we can get a horse to behave like god or do we have to dress up a couple of my cousins in fresno
606441 is it true as someone said that william saroyan is the most famous armenian who ever lived
606442 but they were good words but only a hundred good words
606443 reader take my advice dont die just dont die thats all it doesnt pay
606444 a great living member of the human race died and he is gone and dont you do it
606445 but howd ya get hold of that phone how the hell old are ya
606446 it doesnt have to be long but something thats better than what that killer sakakibara wrote
606447 its only when i kill that i am liberated from the constant hatred that i suffer and that i am able to attain peace
606448 it is only when i give pain to people that i can ease my own pain
606449 you have to make him totally vanish from the face of the earth otherwise if hes still alive you wont ever get rid of the darkness thats in your heart
606450 probably he just felt his mother was a pain a real pain if you told adults that was the reason you killed your mother they wouldnt believe you but its the truth the whole worlds a pain

606452 defining the filipino through the arts from specialistic innocence to participatory consciousness
606453 a quiet feminist who blazed a trail for women in a profession that had never allowed women to participate fully until she came along
606454 was to get sites never photographed or documented they may be mentioned in a monograph but some are like that wonderful house in san jose
606455 shes getting better known in the bay area particularly but she deserves to be on the same level as frank lloyd wright louis sullivan bernard maybeck and greene and greene
606456 she could inspire a generation of young people to go into architecture and a career in design
606457 in reality morgan only destroyed a relative handful of her records and none of her plans
606458 its 532 buildings for frank lloyd wright and she completed close to 750
606459 she was influenced but she synthesized the two into something unique
606460 she didnt copy anything when i see a building thats a julia morgan i can almost always tell because of the refinement of proportions
606461 my parents suggested i study art because they knew how much i loved it
606462 boy when all those come back home theres not going to be room for us to live in our house
606463 i like to have the doors open to listen to the birds
606464 i feel that the more you look at the more you learn
606465 i just feel that what i need to do is paint i think as with anything else you just need to do it as your style evolves you get better
606466 i like to think that art keeps them young keeps them going
606467 theres really nothing very interesting about a real estate developer whos also an architect
606468 my mom bless her heart had four sons and we were all 21 months apart
606469 we did everything but tie her up and cook her so we spent a lot of time in our rooms because we were unruly and i would read
606470 burning this thing would have been an insult to fire
606471 since i was going to write and i was interested in guns and have been a marksman and a sharp shooter i figured why not use that theme and move forward with it

606720 well some of those hadiths are not acceptable or true or some other disclaimer
606721 what about the greatness of the islamic golden age why the west got all of its real learning from the muslims they preserved the greek philosophers invented algebra chemistry the algorithm and laid the basis of our learning
606722 the high point of human civilization occurred in baghdad and moorish spain it was all peace and harmony with christians jews and muslims living in multi cultural compatibility
606723 when europe was mired in the dark ages islam was a shining light on the hill
606724 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy

606728 more than 180 palestinians from fatah were authorised to take refuge in israel twenty two of them were wounded and were hospitalised
606729 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose

606745 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
606746 thats not really correct greenhouse gases trap the heat reflected from the earth surely
606747 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
606748 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
606749 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
606750 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
606751 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
606752 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
606753 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
606754 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
606755 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
606756 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
606757 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
606758 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
606759 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
606760 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
606761 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
606762 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
606763 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
606764 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
606765 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
606766 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
606767 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
606768 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
606769 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
606770 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
606771 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
606772 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
606773 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
606774 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
606775 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
606776 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
606777 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
606778 somebody had to do it its good it was us
606779 what shuttleworth may not understand is that a patent troll can be a proxy for someone else who does have something to lose
606780 they have discovered water on mars for the third or fourth time
606781 like a beacon of light a proclamation of love and faith a steadfast companion and guide for the traveler on earth
606782 its rare for an artist to be given a chance like this
606783 after all i have dedicated my life to making religious works like this and i didnt ask for a single cent it follows my advocacy
606784 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
606785 on a global scale i dont think you are going to get this kind of investment again
606786 im still going out there with a mind to win gold to go all out to win glory once again for the motherland
606787 a conservative figure puts it at six gold mens and womens marathon mens 3 000m steeplechase womens 800m and any others in mens 800m and either 5 000m or 10 000m races
606788 we have a strong team possibly equal in strength to the great team of seoul and our team of 1968
606789 my first car was a little austin 7 which i had to start at the front with a handle
606790 then it was a case of running like mad to get in the car before it stopped
606791 at 94 im a bit long in the tooth now for long distance trips but im sure ill be able to keep her entertained

606812 die gegend ist eine kriegszone wir verlangen dort eine waffenruhe damit wir sie freilassen k nnen
606813 seien auf einem berg der region freigelassen worden und dort etwa eine halbe stunde sp ter von sicherheitskr ften gefunden worden
606814 it was an either or i dont think we had our minds set on going one way or the other
606815 it was just what we could purchase or lease that would fit our needs
606816 the idea is you get an anchor tenant to offset the cost of the overall project then use the rest of the lots in the subdivision for revenue generation
606817 we had been talking to peg development utah based developer of the skyway shopping center about additional property and that number was developed previously
606818 they made a proposal that was probably half of that rate
606819 but theyre a good tenant stable you dont have to worry about getting paid so we made about an 8 percent adjustment
606820 when youre a teenager you just take everything in you absorb all these ideas
606821 it just opened my mind not only to new ideas but just that theres a bigger world out there and that i can do anything i want and so when i got home i was like im going to be a filmmaker thats when i decided when i was about 17 and i stuck to my guns
606822 theyre revealing themselves in a way that could follow them for the rest of their lives
606823 i felt the weight of that responsibility when i was making it
606824 i knew i wanted it to be a town that had only one high school
606825 and i wanted it to be economically mixed and i was hoping for it to be racially mixed but that was hard to find in the midwest in small towns
606826 much more than my film and theres much more of an emphasis on wealth and competition
606827 more stagy we want to control everything in america its unfortunate
606828 i think theres something mean spirited about a lot of them too theyre appealing to the basest part of ourselves weve become bottom feeders
606829 i think that because this film is about teenagers there is a natural assumption that its influenced by reality tv because there is so much reality tv about teenagers
606830 but a lot of reality tv got their cues from documentaries and now documentaries are being criticized for learning things from reality tv funny
606831 there were parallel story lines a bit more like you have in
606832 so it was written like that but in the editing process my editor and i realized it wasnt working that left us in a kind of crisis especially me because everybody really liked the script everybody loved the script and i remember going into the shoot with a huge attitude like i knew i had the cast and i knew i had the script and i felt like nothing could go wrong and then it was like waking up we saw the first rough cut and discovered that it didnt work at all
606833 i tell you man people dont doubt you anymore but you cant believe the hype dont believe the hype thats very important
606834 so its a very personal film but dont expect too much each film has to be whatever lets see
606835 the real problem was not the brilliance of the tory conference but the hubris and vacuity of our own this meant the tories by having something to say on policy appeared substantial and to represent the future
606836 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
606837 at present there is every indication that the lessons will not be learnt
606838 the choice is and was always between gb gordon brown running as the change candidate or as continuity nl new labor
606839 by trying to be change he played exactly the same game the media wanted but never the game that gives us the only chance of a 4th term in office
606840 take readers on a journey through their celebrated young lives pausing to reflect on what has helped shape them into who they are today
606841 when you pick up a 2 foot 8 inch human being and throw him to the floor it hurts
606842 a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less than average career
606843 she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of a sudden she has all these kids
606844 a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied but she has no talent
606845 im sure paris would tell you that herself shes a very sweet nice girl but thats it
606846 it is ironic that the birthplace of quakerism in american would choose to commission a disney fied version of this universal theme
606847 reverberations modern and contemporary art from the bank of america collection
606848 our ability to change the way we feel depends upon our ability to change our submodalities

606860 welcome war resisters former u s president john f kennedy once said war will exist until that distant day when the co conscientious objector enjoys the same reputation and prestige that the warrior does today a majority of canadian mps understand this and voted on june 3 to allow u s soldiers who object to the war on terror on conscientious grounds to stay in canada however the conservative government is ignoring the will of these deserters to be deported to face punishment in the u s
606861 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
606862 hes a lot more optimistic than me i can tell you
606863 thats one thing that we used to fight about because im i wouldnt say pound for pound im a total pessimist but i am pretty pessimistic about a lot of things in the economy and the political successes he has lots of success stories to tell although i dont know i guess because a lot of his work has been undone systematically undone by dergulation so how he keeps his spirits up i dont know i really dont
606864 but we all know you dont have a snow balls chance in hell of getting elected
606865 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
606866 this whole nation needs to be turned around were not going to do it with the democrats saying well get around to it someday
606867 nader filed paperwork putting himself on the ballot in utah
606868 this country is not owned by the two major parties they dont own the voters there is not even the word party in the constitution there isnt even the word corporation in the constitution and yet these two institutions have run our country into the ground and are tearing the heart and soul out of america
606869 we aint trying to say oh im down with the streets
606870 there are indie artists now outselling majors simply based on being themselves and building their niche instead of falling in line with all the rank and file
606871 during the whole hyphy movement people was like we gonna rush hyphy hella hard
606872 the bay is only hyphy trying to bottle that creativity that made it weaker
606873 my goal has always been to be the most versatile rapper there is
606874 ive spent my whole career breaking down barriers in order to exist in a variety of genres
606875 the response has been far beyond what i thought it could be
606876 people are really receptive to the fact that im digging deeper than whats usually heard
606877 its not so much a movement or a trend its a constant flow
606878 indies have gotten better we figured out how to survive on a shoestring and stretch it
606879 validated in the hood but dont necessarily have a consistent message
606880 have international recognition but are maybe not as validated on the ground
606881 it should be seen in stadiums it should sell millions we should have all the opportunities available to us that our counterparts in other genres have what we do is no less important than radiohead or u2 or michael jackson and we should be etched in history
606882 cats that are into the indie scene love to make music thats whats feeding it
606883 i have driven by laguna honda and seen picnics on the lawn there and i dont want anything to interfere with what little pleasure those old folks have
606884 were truly trying to preserve this history for future generations
606885 not only is it beautiful with straight grain and no knots or imperfections but mahogany stands up to water very well
606886 these boats are like your finest dining room table but we put them in the water and use them
606887 if you had to be changed to an animal what kind of animal would you prefer to be
606888 in oakland tim hudson was the bulldog and then there was mark mulder and my pitching coach back then rick peterson said i was always better at intensity level five
606889 it feels good to behave the way i want to behave on the mound and relax and be nice and easy
606890 playing little league here when youre not worrying about contracts and stuff like that maybe it had some mojo for me
606891 that motivated me big time zito got respected by the manager to get one of the biggest outs of the night and my job was to preserve this quickly
606892 this is pretty much like watching zito on tv when i was in college
606893 he threw at his tempo not speeding up the game it looked pretty amazing that curve ball that went out of the screen i always wanted to throw one of them its not in my bag
606894 i want to prove i can get to 200 innings and go from there
606895 i would like to go out there and pitch the ninth inning every time
606896 but thats up to me i have to lower my pitch count i have those innings when i start a guy off 2 0 and still get him out thats not really efficient i need to throw strikes right off the bat i need to get guys out quicker
606897 im young theyre probably thinking they dont want to blow me out for the season
606898 if the outcome is good you say well it worked out just fine now we can do it all the time but theres too much stuff that can go on that would make it swing one way or another you cant beat yourself up over it there are so many things you cant control
606899 a lot of people have said that its the way he moves im glad to see a young guy from my country have the opportunity to show his stuff and im glad i have the opportunity to help him out
606900 i was trying to come up with any excuse not to do it
606901 i was attracted to the challenge and risks in the story but i was afraid of the stereotypes of the wise older man and the beautiful young woman that could come across in a cinematic interpretation
606902 but hes very weak hes the dying animal ive met a lot of david kepeshes in my life
606903 ben is one of those actors where you can say now in this take i want a tear to leave your left eye and i want that tear to go down half of your nose and then disappear and ben will do it
606904 the male directors vastly outnumber the female directors that ive worked with
606905 isabel brings a female sense behind the camera that i found brought very exciting dimensions to the film she captures the male vulnerability as a huge asset rather than a weakness all of the characters can then expose their vulnerabilities in her lens because we know were putting them in a very safe place
606906 its not always easy to know exactly where to put the camera to feel perhaps that the audience might be peeping around the corner of the window to see something that the characters would rather they didnt see
606907 whenever i see a script with you gotta love this guy in the stage directions i tend to throw the script across the room realizing its not for me
606908 its really dangerous to try and flirt with the audience in an underhand way and try to get them to love you they have to go through the turmoil of judging the character just as the character judges himself
606909 everyone is talking about this wonderful kiss that im supposed to have had with mary kate olsen in the wackness but no one is talking about my kiss with dennis hopper i asked for many takes in filming that scene
606910 sabertooth storm what do they call you wheels this is the stupidest thing ive ever heard
606911 no doubt youve discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm as your father believes
606912 lets face it this is not the worst thing youve caught me doing
606913 i believe whatever doesnt kill you simply makes you stranger
606914 the ten commandments are the foundation of western morality and the american constitution and government
606915 generally acknowledged to be one of the 10 best movies ever
606916 naive idea that art is the direct personal expression of individual emotional experience art is almost never that great art never is
606917 livings easy on a houseboat let the ocean rock us back and forth to sleep
606918 if i go to heaven ill be bored as hell like a little baby at the bottom of a well
606919 shes sexy but the concept of altering barbie of turning her into a piece of art brings it into the realm of personal identity
606920 for many of the artists it stops being about barbie and becomes a celebration of the self
606921 now i spend my time trying to alter the barbie image by making barbie into a warrior a social deviant fattening her giving her more muscle
606922 sometimes i try to make her more like the actual people in my life because i am so sick of the blond princess image and the glamour queen doll i grew up with
606923 the reason i enjoy working with barbie is that she is iconic and always seems to be ready for her up close
606924 she represents the good and the bad stereotypes of culture race materialism womanhood in that sense i find something amusing and gratifying about altering something so solidly representative of old fashioned values
606925 the thing about barbie that makes me feel sorry for her is that she has no nipples
606926 nipples are my specialty and many of my barbies are bare chested so i can give her a beautiful set of nipples she likes that
606927 barbie has always been very focused on getting married almost every barbie book ends with her engagement or wedding and im attempting to subvert the idea of marriage as a goal or end in itself for both women and men with these pieces
606928 its pretty easy to argue that this is the most prestigious competition of its kind in the world
606929 the reason is that the signature part of the prize is a 50 concert tour all around the united states canada and mexico
606930 a lot of other competitions are things you put on your resume and then move on but with this the exposure you get is something that can start a career
606931 i said if were going to do this lets invite a bunch of the people who ive met on my travels that have blown my mind
606932 its kind of a geek fest a star trek convention its a safe place for a lot of people
606933 the classical guitar landscape used to be much more fragmented than it is now
606934 when the foundation was started in 1974 there were maybe three or four schools in the country where you could get a degree in guitar performance now there are about 500 you can get them anywhere
606935 and having all these thriving guitar programs has created a whole generation of dedicated and interesting guitar professionals
606936 because unlike violinists we cant go take auditions for orchestra jobs
606937 but the twist with guitarists is that were more likely to cross over into other kinds of music pop jazz flamenco world music and so on and although the concerts at the convention are primarily classical the foundation does try to help those cross pollinations
606938 also because guitarists dont have as rich a history in the classical and romantic eras were probably more active in trying to cultivate new music guitarists tend to be very cutting edge in trying to figure out just what the life of our instrument is
606939 having the convention here is a real feather in our cap
606940 its a recognition of the importance of the city with people like david encouraging composition and sergio selecting this out of all the places he could have gone
606941 there may be more players in new york or los angeles but if you think of places where there is a lot of activity and a vibrant scene its san francisco
606942 a pair of schoolroom scissors lying on the floor just one snip and cathy wasnt chatty anymore
606943 i called her that morning to see if she needed a ride to church
606944 she said she was going to walk but then she never made it
606945 for all its innovation this is not the most lovable movie in the world its a little cold and in its time not everyone was crazy about it you might not be either
606946 theres a certain kind of cavalier feeling about smuggling within the whole community
606947 when you strike up a conversation up where i live someone is going to have a story
606948 the way melissa played benicia del toro s wife in that film was so compelling i felt instinctively shed make a great character
606949 im a little shy and dont like to schmooze but i was so moved by her performance that after the screening i walked up to her and basically gushed
606950 i knew what the finances were it wasnt a worry free childhood
606951 its refreshing to see that over 30 if youre engaged in your life you tend to look beautiful european films are a lot more open to actresses who are allowed to be more than you know 24 years old in melissas case even more powerful than showing up with no makeup was her willingness to show as much emotion as she did i hope people see her as not only beautiful but also somewhat heroic
606952 on the internet there was actually a frame by frame analysis of one of the x files trailers trying to figure out what the story is
606953 trailer producers sometimes distort and flop images and take moments from one scene to create another context
606954 i dont think theres anything that replaces the experience of seeing a movie on the big screen with an audience but this is a very odd climate right now
606955 i hear nothing but doom and gloom about the independent films yet theyre the only good ones being made because theyre about people everything else is about special effects
606956 when we opened the last picture show in 1971 the movie played four months in one theater before it got the academy award nominations in february
606957 what we do is a mixture of music that draws from the influences along the rio de la plata the river that forms part of the border between argentina and uruguay and tango is a part of that along with milonga and candombe but then you have what the rest of the band brings to it that adds elements of rock electronica and hip hop
606958 weve been playing this music for a while now and it has taken different turns and we no longer know what to call it
606959 we are trying to do something that expresses the folk music of today by taking the past and putting it into a form that transcends it back to the dance hall
606960 i arrived in the united states in 1978 when the argentine government was killing and imprisoning people like me students and musicians who dared to have long hair and sing songs of protest
606961 arriving in los angeles i saw how mexican immigrants were treated and it reminded me of my country
606962 we were pioneers in rock en espa ol in argentina at a time when there were a lot of bands but nobody to produce them
606963 the awards are a tremendous honor but they arent just about me
606964 they are also shared with all the people who worked with me on these projects
606965 when we did our first album the musicians were only in the studio 30 percent of the time
606966 for mar dulce we did 80 percent of the music live in the recording studio and brought in some special guests to help us out with the vocals
606967 since we cant have all of our friends who sang on the album with us i will be singing some of the songs at stern grove
606968 there are more but these are the ones that i am prioritizing right now
606969 it offers a cultural map of latin america and shows that we are more than just mexican sombreros and congas not that i have anything against that but i want to stretch past the stereotypes
606970 w re es wirklich so m sste man die ausstellung schon jetzt er ffnen
606971 i enjoyed it i cant wait to do it again
606972 it was them that actually said stop the talk walk the walk get it done its been talked about for 40 years
606973 i remember he said i dont think ill ever get to go swimming in the harbour and were going to go swimming next week
606974 i knew one of these days wed be able to swim here again
606975 as we were coming in we kind of knew that there was something happening with being allowed to swim we just didnt know it was right here this morning
606976 this is a great super surprise i think now were going to actually go for a swim too might as well be part of the historic event
606977 tim spent his life travelling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone
606978 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
606979 you could hear him laughing a mile away it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
606980 badger is armed with a knife and a pair of scissors and he is defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
606981 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
606982 okay badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
606983 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
606984 i never knew tim and his family but i wish all the best in this awful time
606985 the outpouring of well wishes from complete strangers has been overwhelming
606986 as of right now weve seen little to no impact on ticket sales and inter city bus travel continues to be a safe way to travel
606987 they are taught to immediately pull over the bus and call the authorities
606988 this campaign was always going to be closer than many people thought it would be
606989 poor obama seems to have thought it wouldnt be close at all
606990 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president or mr universe
606991 not like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
606992 if anyone thinks that picking a woman will simply placate hillary clintons supporters i think thats very patronizing
606993 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
606994 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
606995 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen today because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
606996 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore stuff like that you know
606997 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
606998 it just didnt come to me you know im just not on top of things like that i guess i should have said something to mike its just so unimportant to me i just dont get it
606999 revenge killer when he feels that he has been slighted he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
607000 weve reached a point in our civilization where counterculture has mutated into a self obsessed aesthetic vacuum so while hipsterdom is the end product of all prior countercultures its been stripped of its subversion and originality
607001 a youth subculture that mirrors the doomed shallowness of mainstream society
607002 it is said that black hole does not reflect light but i have seen the mention of picture of black hole in a magazine how is this possible

607010 as the pain subsides he will increase his activity if the pain stays low we will increase the activity so it is basically a day to day week to week type thing
607011 he doesnt know if he has the time for football anymore
607012 hes in several business ventures and hes doing pretty well for himself so he doesnt know if he has the passion for football right now
607013 we signed him late and weve been real pleased that we signed him
607014 ive been shopping a couple times looking for one i can fold up ive had to go to stores buy a chair then return it when im done
607015 we do the best we can with our budgets and our coaches are pretty frugal but no one could have predicted this

607020 hes like i just told all the guys not to call me crash and im like yeah but im your wife i can call you crash we have a very sarcastic relationship
607021 at the time they didnt think that was going to be much of a problem
607022 i am most excited to see the state of utah blow up when two undefeated teams match up for a bcs bowl berth in the final game of the season one where utah will reclaim its rightful perch as the best football team and school if there was a doubt in the state
607023 this year i want to see if utah can get over the hump and have another 10 win conference championship season
607024 i want a win over byu and i dont want to suffer through more heartbreaking conference losses
607025 im so excited about byu football that i paid several hundred dollars to have a 125 foot pine tree taken out of my yard so the satellite can have a clear path as i can finally watch byu destroy everybody that steps in their way this season

607040 hed rather lose a war in order to win a campaign
607041 its like an airplane wing you push a button and whoop it all accordions down so theres no room to score down low take a pad thats 38 inches put two of them back to back and youre covering the entire bottom part of the net plus 4 inches
607042 particularly with goaltenders the cardinal rule is dont get beat five hole
607043 you get beat once fine if you get beat twice youre done youre sitting on the bench if you can plant a seed of doubt in the goaltenders that you can get beat there and youre vulnerable in that spot the head worms start going and once they start going in a goaltenders game hes in big trouble
607044 the expectation is that by early september the league will have made that decision in large part based on feedback from players
607045 they need to do tests to confirm theres no negative impact on the ice and there isnt weve done enough testing and have had enough players use them at this point
607046 it certainly may give an agent and a player reason to pause
607047 but in the end if the team and deal feel right then the player will sign with the club once a player is locked into a contract then it is all about trusting the team to treat its employee fairly within the rules of the collective bargaining agreement
607048 i have to come into camp in shape and have a good camp nothing is set in stone ive got to go in and still win a spot i like being part of the bruins organization theyre going in a great direction right now with all the young talent and making the playoffs last year its real exciting to be part of this organization its up and coming i like my chances but ive got to go into camp play my game and hopefully it all works out
607049 it was an honor for me i was pretty disappointed that we lost how we did but in my eyes it was still a successful year we had a great regular season with a great group of guys it was a learning process for me being captain i learned a lot on and off the ice how to deal with certain situations hopefully it helped me in the long run
607050 everything appears right on schedule for brocks full return in the fall
607051 hes doing some light stickhandling still no contact but hes well on the path to a complete recovery
607052 he broke the humerus bone then broke it again no connection to the first break bruins orthopedist thomas gill looked at it and he came the same conclusion as our doctors at st elizabeths it was a freak accident
607053 i was at the select 17 camps this summer talking to some chicago scouts and they were very impressed with him
607054 they had a minicamp earlier in july and they thought he was very assertive
607055 there are two types of salmon there the chinook or king salmon then the coho salmon
607056 theres a lot of coho so we went fishing for four days so you could bring back four chinook and four coho or no chinook and eight coho the maximum amount of chinook would have bee four so you end up playing that fishing derby game do you keep it or let it go and wait for something bigger theres a little strategy theres a lot of fish there and they want to keep it that way
607057 i dont think that prices will return to the record level nor will they fall below 100 per barrel

607061 i am satisfied that there is a sufficient weight of evidence to support that there is an unexplained phenomenon of considerable interest in loch ness the evidence suggests the presence of large aquatic animals
607062 i personally find them the underwater photographs extremely intriging and sufficiently suggestive of a large aquatic animal to both urge and recommend that in the future most intensive investigations be undertaken in the loch

607066 die alltagsdinge die einen beschwerten sind nicht mehr pr sent dass man 20 jahre auf eine wohnung wartete ich hatte seit 1980 eine dringlichkeitsbescheinigung weil ich mit drei kindern in einer zweieinhalb zimmer wohnung wohnte oder dass alle drei kinder meiner schwester die pastorin war nicht zur erweiterten oberschule gehen durften all diese dinge geraten in vergessenheit weil es wohl auch in der natur des menschen liegt sich an die positiven dinge erinnern zu wollen und die negativen zu verdr ngen
607067 dass es eben auch normales leben im unnormalen gegeben hat es gab die gleiche freude auf den sommerurlaub der zwar nicht auf mallorca sondern vielleicht an den m rkischen seen verbracht wurde auch das konnte gl cklich machen man hatte sich eingerichtet in den beschr nkungen
607068 das liegt daran dass wir nach der wende eine ebenso undifferenzierte verneinung all dessen gehabt haben was die ddr ausmachte
607069 es entsteht immer dieses schwarz wei schema es gab in der ddr vielleicht zwei prozent opfer und vielleicht drei prozent t ter und 95 prozent waren volk die wollten auch gar nichts anderes sein wollten f r sich und ihre familie das beste aus ihrem leben machen im nachhinein aber wird die ddr bev lkerung eingeteilt in t ter und opfer nun m ssen die leute alle sehen wie sie auf das opfer ufer kommen weil sie sonst alle zu den t tern gerechnet werden sie m ssen ihre widerstandsgeschichten erz hlen und wie oft sie die faust in der hosentasche geballt haben aber sie waren weder das eine noch das andere
607070 ich bin manchmal rgerlich wenn gesagt wird die ddr sei ein einziger schrotthaufen gewesen die menschen haben nach dem krieg eine unglaubliche aufbauleistung erbracht und zwar ohne marshallplan und bei gleichzeitiger demontage und bei gleichzeitigen reparationszahlungen an die sowjetunion

607076 the 1 4 million figure listed by the respective companies in this article is not inclusive of reported cancellations

607082 a dozen reasons why obama will be the next president money back guarantee
607083 sedang dia salah seorang dari dua orang ketika keduanya berada dalam gua di waktu dia berkata kepada sahabatnya janganlah kamu berduka cita sesungguhnya allah beserta kita
607084 dan orang yang membawa kebenaran dan membenarkannya mereka itulah orang orang yang bertakwa
607085 sesungguhnya allah telah menjadikanku sebagai kekasih nya sebagaimana dia menjadikan ibrahim sebagai kekasih nya dan kalau saja aku mengambil dari umatku sebagai kekasih akan aku jadikan abu bakar sebagai kekasih
607086 yang dimaksud hamba tersebut adalah rasulullah dan abu bakar adalah orang yang paling tahu diantara kami
607087 sesungguhnya orang yang paling banyak memberikan perlindungan kepadaku dengan harta dan persahabatannya adalah abu bakar
607088 sesungguhnya allah telah mengutusku kepada kalian semua namun kalian malah berkata kamu adalah pendusta sedangkan abu bakar membenarkan ajaranku dia telah membantuku dengan jiwa dan hartanya apakah kalian akan meninggalkan aku dengan meninggalkan shahabatku
607089 demi ayah dan ibuku sebagai tebusanmu allah tidak akan menghimpun dua kematian pada dirimu
607090 amma bad du barang siapa diantara kalian ada yang menyembah muhammad maka sesungguhnya muhammad telah mati kalau kalian menyembah allah maka sesungguhnya allah maha hidup dan tidak akan pernah mati allah telah berfirman
607091 muhammad itu tidak lain hanyalah seorang rasul sungguh telah berlalu sebelumnya beberapa orang rasul apakah jika dia wafat atau dibunuh kamu berbalik ke belakang murtad barangsiapa yang berbalik ke belakang maka ia tidak dapat mendatangkan mudharat kepada allah sedikitpun dan allah akan memberi balasan kepada orang orang yang bersyukur
607092 demi allah seakan akan orang orang tidak mengetahui bahwa allah telah menurunkan ayat ini sampai abu bakar membacakannya maka semua orang menerima ayat al qur an itu tak seorangpun diantara mereka yang mendengarnya melainkan melantunkannya
607093 demi allah sepertinya aku baru mendengar ayat itu ketika dibaca oleh abu bakar sampai sampai aku tak kuasa mengangkat kedua kakiku hingga aku tertunduk ke tanah ketika aku mendengar abu bakar membacanya kini aku sudah tahu bahwa nabi memang sudah meninggal
607094 maka orang orang menabahkan hati mereka sambil tetap mengucurkan air mata lalu orang orang anshor berkumpul di sekitar sa ad bin ubadah yang berada di saqifah bani sa idah
607095 dari kalangan kami anshor ada pemimpin demikian pula dari kalangan kalian
607096 demi allah yang kuinginkan sebenarnya hanyalah mengungkapkan hal yang menurutku sangat bagus aku khawatir abu bakar tidak menyampaikannya
607097 tidak demi allah kami tidak akan melakukannya dari kami ada pemimpin dan dari kalian juga ada pemimpin
607098 bahkan kami akan membai atmu engkau adalah sayyid kami orang yang terbaik diantara kami dan paling dicintai rasulullah
607099 sekarang abu bakar tidak akan lagi memerahkan susu kambing kami
607100 tidak bahkan aku akan tetap menerima jasa memerah susu kambing kalian sesungguhnya aku berharap dengan jabatan yang telah aku sandang sekarang ini sama sekali tidak merubah kebiasaanku di masa silam
607101 wahai atiq julukan abu bakar mereka itu adalah orang orang yang baik oleh karena itu jalinlah persahabatan yang baik dengan mereka
607102 wahai ayahku tidak ada daya dan upaya kecuali hanya dengan pertolongan allah aku telah diberi beban yang sangat berat tentu saja aku tidak akan memiliki kekuatan untuk menanggungnya kecuali hanya dengan pertolongan allah
607103 there is substantial evidence that entering school later reduces educational attainment by increasing high school drop out rates and depresses lifetime earnings by delaying entry into the job market
607104 recent stagnation in the high school and college completion rates of young people is partly explained by their later start in primary school
607105 this fad is like many previous education fads intuitively plausible but actually

607109 acum trei patru zile prezent la respargerea unor strazi am fost sa vad de ce trebuie am crezut ca sunt microfisuri dar era o lucrare pe 50 de metri si am avut curiozitatea sa cobor in pasajul universitatii dar nu am putut merge pentru ca erau gunoaie ca la marginea capitalei
607110 vom vedea pentru la anul si in niciun caz nu mai atacam haotic toate strazile sa ne injure toata lumea ca nu am avea un plan
607111 solutia este ca intr o luna vreau sa termin camera de coordonare care stabileste ce strazi se refac in 2009 vin si cei de la retele si apa canal si din momentul acela primarul general isi da cuvintul de onoare ca nu mai da nicio aprobare decat pentru situatii de urgenta ca ne prinde 2090 in aceeasi situatie
607112 i was not 100 per cent happy with my laps in q3
607113 i went a little bit at the wrong time and there were so many cars around
607114 q2 was a great lap i was just able to get the best out of the car which just had great balance unfortunately it doesnt count for much but im still confident for sure im going to do my best tomorrow to gain some positions
607115 they were looking for a second rider for the two british rounds so i had a sneaky word with paul at one of the races i had read that they couldnt field eugene laverty because of reasons through sponsors so paul asked if i fancied a go and that was it

607118 as i understand it many of the mould variations have been identified as a result of the original m amp m loose leaf collectors guide which i also understand was not created by the tm but they purchased the rights to it this original book has become pretty much the basis of all our views of mould variations i think we should consider if the fact that a candlestick is thinner on a mould 1 than a mould 2 is really that relevant anymore especially where the variation is only slight and cannot be clearly identified in a picture

607324 despite concrete steps to advance peace and democratic development in sierra leone women who constitute 49 percent of registered voters are under represented and continue to face significant challenges to full participation in politics
607325 women in local governance is pivotal in our fledging democracy and development strides
607326 i built community markets for the women i established rice mills for women farmers which improved their production of rice and subsequently their income i constructed eight primary community schools in villages where there had never been schools i gave scholarships to 70 girls and i even extended some of my projects to other wards were womens needs are desperate
607327 now there is only one woman in the council i wonder how much she will be able to accomplish for women but i know the men in the council will not be able to address the needs of women because they do not relate to womens issues
607328 i wonder if the new councillors dominated by men will continue to support the mill when the whole project has been grounded on womens empowerment my family has practically been managed from the proceeds my wife gets from her rice business
607329 we only got a clinic for the first time in our community when we got a female councillor if big politicians are threatening the women refusing to give them symbol for them to stand for the elections then things will not develop in this country
607330 the northern region of the country where i wanted to stand for councilor really needs female representation because that part of the country has the highest rate of female illiteracy so much so that the government had to institute affirmative action in giving scholarships to female students how could we close the gaps in education if we are not there to push for these interests
607331 democracy is all about numbers and the fewer women in council means the less impact women will make to address their issues
607332 they could raise their voices even beyond their council or influence the chairperson of their council to seek womens welfare

607343 why senator clintons vote for the neocon kyl lieberman amendment of course
607344 edwards to clinton american people deserve the truth not more doubletalk on iran
607345 in our last debate on september 26 senator clinton said that she would neither consider a reduction in benefits raising the retirement age nor raising the salary cap on the social security tax later she was overheard telling tom bowman i would consider lifting the cap perhaps above 200 000 now we all wonder what her position on social security reform is and if we can trust anything she says
607346 yes i did say that to mr bowman but lets put it into context first of all i want to do everything i can to minimize the tax burden on the elderly and the working middle class so we must begin with fiscal responsibility in federal spending everyone here knows that cutting benefits raising the retirement age and raising the salary cap are the tools available to fix social security but my position is that the federal government needs to make some sacrifice too here is the call to action lets end the no bid cost plus contracts to halliburton lets repeal the tax cut for the wealthiest people in america lets end the war in iraq once we reverse the insane spending and tax policies of the bush administration once we are certain that weve done our share in reducing the burden on the elderly and middle class and we can sit down and discuss what lesser measures are needed to fix social security
607347 no we are not going to allow this we are not going to allow this march to war in iran

607351 if only i had known then what i know now
607352 i dont know hillarys experience shes never run a city shes never run a state shes never run a business shes never met a payroll shes never been responsible for the safety and security of millions of people much less even hundreds of people so im trying to figure out where the experience is here

607378 my mother used to bring me as a child and i continue it with my kids
607379 the diverse community that is represented here at caribana is one of the most exciting manifestation of who we are as a country
607380 besides who ever needed an excuse to dance up and down the waterfront of toronto hour after hour
607381 because all the bands and stuff the people the food
607382 as managing editor mike had an approach that he dealt with the facts and thats what ive always enjoyed about mikes principled approach
607383 the community will be in a tremendous state of shock
607384 i respected him as somebody who would always speak his best on behalf of the community
607385 i appreciated his clarity and how he was able to present a balanced perspective on issues
607386 out of his time here i can think of less than five times that hes been sick
607387 mike was always the first one to defend fort mcmurray against outside news stories that focused solely on negative things
607388 it was important to him that fort mcmurray today presented a more rounded picture of the area good news happens here too and mike knew that a newspaper needs to tell those stories without turning a blind eye to the regions problems and challenges
607389 has achieved the most remarkable wedding of scientific truth and artistic feeling i have ever seen
607390 has the exceptional ability to capture such moments with a seemingly effortless assurance but which can only come from intimate knowledge immense care and remarkable talent
607391 jesus said so when you see the desolating sacrilege spoken of by the prophet daniel let him who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house
607392 i dont think that prices will return to the record level nor will they fall below 100 per barrel
607393 what some media reported that kuwaits oil reserves are less than that is wrong and not based on scientific record on the contrary there are new discoveries
607394 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
607395 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
607396 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
607397 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
607398 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
607399 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
607400 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
607401 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
607402 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
607403 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
607404 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
607405 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
607406 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
607407 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
607408 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
607409 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
607410 alle fragen in eine trommel und dann wird gezogen welche raus geht
607411 the new camaro delivers the best of both worlds great heritage and a thoroughly modern advanced package of performance comfort and technology
607412 its a sports car for a new generation of enthusiasts that doesnt forget the heritage that helped make the original a cultural icon
607413 camaro delivers all of the things that make chevrolet such a revered global brand
607414 it is a car that competes with the best sports cars in its class but does so with surprising efficiency that is no small feat and it took a worldwide commitment to achieve it
607415 the alternative theory about alzheimers is that the cell replication process gets triggered pathologically and then the cells are programmed to die and thats whats killing the nerve cells not the amyloid
607416 this study all hinges on the theory that its a false signal to replicate that starts these neurons down the path to killing themselves
607417 its one thing to distinguish the sick group from the healthy group and another to see if you can predict from the healthy group who gets the disease
607418 we are better prepared this time to perform in malaysia and we have deep respect for the culture it is about the music not about sexy we are going to respect the people of this country and the culture
607419 i just have to thank everyone for helping me come so far ive had such an amazing time in asia
607420 i cant say anything about it yet but there is a possibility that i will be singing there
607421 i will wear the uniform for the sake of historical interpretation
607422 since we only have one i guess that makes me captain by default
607423 that wool uniform is the only thing that concerns me
607424 this is definitely going be an experience that will show me the history of the game
607425 but the grounds were so small we kept putting balls in the canal or hitting the building with them
607426 historical ball clubs were developed from the town stock to provide civic pride
607427 the idea is to raise awareness of baseballs early days
607428 we are not looking for all stars just those interested in the game if theres enough interest maybe we can get a full set of uniforms for next year
607429 i dumped the clothes out of a clothes hamper and slid down inside it
607430 i had to flip the record player on we didnt have a recorder back then and i sang the purple people eater
607431 its a fun way to spend the day its something people can do with their family
607432 once i agreed to do it people paid one of the pitchers who played in the world series to throw balls
607433 he probably threw 20 balls and i got dunked about 90 percent of the time
607434 when you bite into an oreo puff the oreo has become this warm sweet yummy concoction
607435 the alligator nuggets are made by a company from florida
607436 its hard to get local restaurants because there are certain permits they have to obtain to make food outdoors many of them dont have the permits
607437 this is a technique that was created by renaissance painters
607438 it will teach you how to look outside the box
607439 i started my school because i believe everyone can learn and everyone can learn to draw
607440 and art meets a lot of needs for a lot of children
607441 the camp is designed to teach the children photography techniques that can be applied at home
607442 children are growing up with digital cameras and i want to help develop their skills
607443 ive learned how to make a drawing look more interesting and how to align a subject on paper
607444 i have to think about what i want to put on my drawing and where
607445 i like art because you get to create your own things with different colors of the rainbow
607446 nicki provides her with information about the technical aspects of art
607447 and her pictures and drawings progress throughout the week its really amazing to see how much her work has improved
607448 and how big i want things in the pictures i take to be in my drawings
607449 when you put the picture in the right place it looks better
607450 i used colored pencils today to add detail and this also makes the drawing look better
607451 i know how to make sure light is on my side or the sun is to my back when i take photos im pretty sure that the camp is helping make my drawing and photography skills better
607452 some of the children have gained so much confidence because of what they were able to create
607453 i like the idea of having a las vegas chefs conference in our town but cant sleep at night with all them creating a rucus
607454 it wasnt so bad last year but last night i didnt get to bed until 3 am with all the shananigans going on
607455 people are buying this las vegas chefs stuff like hotcakes im thrilled about the success of these products
607456 ive got double the usual number of orders since the conferenced started this means our company will probably have a surplus at the end of the year and will allow us to continue strong into the next quarter
607457 and eventually i want to start my own las vegas chefs business that will parallel my work in hollywood
607458 im so thankful that many las vegas chefs industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine
607459 we need to talk about the 2030 maryland we want to live in and how we can get there
607460 we need to pass meaningful growth management reform and we need a lot of people involved in the effort
607461 if we are really trying to make growth smarter we need to look at infrastructure improvements
607462 we also need meaningful financial disincentives to direct growth away from rural areas
607463 we need mixed used development in our growth areas so we can create an urban village where residents dont have to get in the car for everything
607464 no one likes density when it is not well designed but we have an opportunity to build nice places
607465 there is a sense of community without the feeling of being shoved in
607466 focus on what we want to see and change the laws to get that to happen
607467 dont make growth areas dysfunctional with adequate public facilities regulations that dont work
607468 we still have to come back to go to the fair
607469 there is nothing around that is this reasonable for simple plain fun we love the vendors and the games all the kids look forward to it
607470 i would love to raise a piglet but my mom probably would not go for it
607471 you just have to plant them weed them and then pick them
607472 its not about games or a carnival its all about the farm
607473 join herbie as he takes on goofy cavemen joins george washingtons army gets the better of pop culture figures like gregory peck and the queen of england and dons the unassuming costume of the fat fury for the very first time
607474 in 3000 years of our history people from all over the world have come and invaded us captured our lands conquered our minds from alexander onwards the greeks the turks the moguls the portuguese the british the french the dutch all of them came and looted us took over what was ours yet we have not done this to any other nation we have not conquered anyone we have not grabbed their land their culture their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them why because we respect the freedom of others
607475 people love fantasy football leagues and everything that comes with it
607476 whether its for the glory of winning bragging rights or whatever other gentlemanly reward is at stake people have been flooding our site looking for the edge that will help them win it as always were happy to oblige

607485 i personally chose the styling design materials and colors for the entire line and also wanted to make sure it was super comfortable each shoe has a heart shaped comfort pad sewn into the inner sole so you can dance and party all night long i also made the soles of the shoes hot pink so from every angle they are super cute

607487 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
607488 1gb 2rx16 pc2 5300s 555 12 hymp112s64cp6 y5 ab 0808
607489 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
607490 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
607491 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
607492 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
607493 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
607494 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
607495 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
607496 who are open to doing something on the production side
607497 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
607498 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
607499 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
607500 christina applegate was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer benefiting from early detection through a doctor ordered mri the cancer is not life threatening christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery no further statement will be issued at this time
607501 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
607502 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
607503 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
607504 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
607505 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
607506 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
607507 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
607508 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
607509 i would just like to take the chance to say that everyone is welcome to show their appreciation and come down to the lake with candles etc
607510 it is simply to celebrate the wonderful boy my brother was and the life he has had
607511 we will all be there to get through it and will share the memories doujon would like us to share
607512 on behalf of myself and the zammit family i would like to say thanks for everything use use have done and all the support that has been showed this truly is amazing
607513 doujon is in all of our hearts and will be forever
607514 to keep doujons memory alive i would like to use this facebook page as an online petition to rename the park next to the lake where doujon grew up and where i met doujon for the first time many years ago
607515 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
607516 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
607517 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
607518 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
607519 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
607520 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
607521 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
607522 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
607523 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
607524 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
607525 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
607526 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
607527 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
607528 why wouldnt a team pay that much for a guy who consistently gets his team to the playoffs
607529 look who would be stupid enough to pay that much money for that many years when you have teams like the rockies and indians making successful playoff runs on low payrolls
607530 hed have to pay us to come play after what we experienced the past three years hes great in april but he couldnt hit his butt with both hands in october
607531 he wont even lift a baseball for less than our asking price

607542 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
607543 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
607544 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
607545 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
607546 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
607547 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
607548 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
607549 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
607550 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
607551 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
607552 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
607553 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
607554 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
607555 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
607556 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
607557 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
607558 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
607559 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
607560 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
607561 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
607562 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
607563 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
607564 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
607565 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
607566 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
607567 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
607568 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
607569 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
607570 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
607571 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
607572 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
607573 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
607574 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
607575 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
607576 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
607577 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
607578 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
607579 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
607580 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
607581 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
607582 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
607583 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
607584 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
607585 never in my life has anything like this happened to me

607610 i have very big plans for amanuca island resort and this includes a yachting facility the deep water marina that i plan to build on the island would be able to cater for 150 crafts and will also have a bunkering facility
607611 during the construction phase of the resort i spent more than 1 3 million on local labour and i plan to spend more while constructing the yachting facility
607612 a total of six months in the country is more than sufficient

607617 statement by the chairman of the macroeconomic policy committee and governor of the reserve bank of fiji revised economic projections
607618 economic growth for 2008 is now projected at 1 7 percent down from the 2 2 percent announced in october last year
607619 while economic recovery is still expected in the next 2 years it will be lower than earlier projected we now expect the economy to grow by 1 1 percent in 2009 and by 1 6 percent in 2010
607620 exports are projected to expand by 7 7 percent this year while imports are expected to grow by 4 6 percent the growth in exports is encouraging however in absolute dollar terms the growth in imports is expected to outpace exports this will lead to a slightly higher trade deficit in 2008 higher payments for mineral fuels continue to contribute to strong import growth we therefore need to grow exports at a much higher rate

607757 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
607758 hes a lot more optimistic than me i can tell you
607759 thats one thing that we used to fight about because im i wouldnt say pound for pound im a total pessimist but i am pretty pessimistic about a lot of things in the economy and the political successes he has lots of success stories to tell although i dont know i guess because a lot of his work has been undone systematically undone by dergulation so how he keeps his spirits up i dont know i really dont

607777 according to our forecasts in august we are likely to have two or three typhoons landing in our coastal areas and that might affect qingdao shanghai and hong kong

607779 normally a typhoon will only affect an area for one or two days
607780 both parties are talking the green bay packers and brett and i think the discussions are moving ahead
607781 because i think we have to force it i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on the behalf of the packers on behalf of brett and on behalf of all the fans
607782 it starts primarily with does brett want to play football
607783 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only the two parties can make those determinations not me
607784 i think they are being reasonable there are difficult emotional issues and theyre important to the future of both of them brett has a great legacy and the packers have a great franchise that theyre trying to move forward with i think theyre trying to balance that in a way that is responsible to each party

607793 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
607794 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
607795 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
607796 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
607797 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
607798 im still going out there with a mind to win gold to go all out to win glory once again for the motherland

607800 but i am not scoring runs as a number three batsmen i have got to score runs and in this series what have i got
607801 i have had some good balls a little bit of bad luck but i set myself a lot of high standards and in this series i have not got anywhere near those standards so i want to look at that and make sure i get back to playing like i can
607802 you have to deliver out in the middle i am an experienced player and at the minute i am not delivering so i will have to come up with a formula to give myself the best chance to deliver when the pressure is on
607803 let the dust settle because emotions always run high after defeats like this
607804 its the first time i have ever lost back to back games and i am more gutted than anyone because midway through the day i expected us to bowl them out for 200 and win quite comfortably
607805 let the dust settle from today and try to work out where we are
607806 we are not playing the level of cricket which i would like i cant fault any of the efforts from any of the players they are giving it absolutely everything but we are just not playing well enough as a unit or as well as we can and that has to be looked at
607807 there are a lot of us who have to look at the batting and say we are not performing to the standard we would expect
607808 it was a real bitter blow that because when we hathat partnership between collingwood and sidebottom to get us up to 280 i put us as favourites to win the game
607809 but it was a very special innings from graeme smith
607810 the way he came out and played and chased down that target was as good an innings as i have ever seen under that sort of pressure
607811 even inhe last hour i thought we were one wicket away
607812 i have obviously had some really meaningful innings in my life including the double hundreds here on the last tour
607813 but when you sum the whole situation up so many teams have come here and strived for victories without success i would have to say that its my best
607814 i guess we would wish we could be back home to share it with everyone as we know it means so much to people for us this was bigger than just a cricket game
607815 since readmission we have targeted wins in australia india and england
607816 we have ticked off one of them and that is something we really wanted to do
607817 i am thankful we are not going to the oval at 1 1
607818 they were ahead of the game when we started this morning and it was important for us to wrest the momentum back
607819 tony blair continues to be 100 supportive of gordon brown and the government

607832 at the height of the cold war my father decided like so many others in the forgotten corners of the world that his yearning his dream required the freedom and opportunity promised by the west
607833 and so he wrote letter after letter to universities all across america until somebody somewhere answered his prayer for a better life

607867 mr hagees videos have never had the same circulation on television as mr wrights a sonorous white preacher spouting venom just doesnt have the telegenic zing of a theatrical black man it is disingenuous to pretend that there isnt a double standard operating here if were to judge black candidates on their most controversial associates and how quickly sternly and completely they disown them we must judge white politicians by the same yardstick

607887 the service unites people who have shared a similar experience of losing a loved one and often it can be devastating for the people left behind with so many unanswered questions

607889 theres no doubt the former howard government did little to work with the states
607890 but under the rudd government weve moved from an era of confrontation to a period of cooperation
607891 but the states will continue to take the lead in delivering services and that wont change
607892 i disagree in terms of his prognosis and his prescription
607893 if there has been a diminution of confidence in performance of state governments i think hes largely to blame for it

607901 we expect the prison population will grow with serious offenders at the worst end of the scale thats where the pressure will come
607902 this was an issue that needed to be resolved were not looking at an election context
607903 it was an issue which with the recent court of appeal decision we had to act on weve moved expeditiously
607904 believe me its a real talking point in the prison this truth in sentencing in particular
607905 i think if it had of been brought in a long long time ago there would be a lot of people walking around now quite a lot
607906 the last thing i ever want to do is to make this issue political its not a political issue its a community issue
607907 we all wish he would come back but he has given no indication that he will
607908 i suppose we are all publicly saying what a terrific bloke he is what a fantastic political talent he is how much we miss him we love him we want him
607909 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
607910 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once but sadly have not yet had and probably never will

607993 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
607994 looking into the crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then
607995 no but ill paint some lines in the parking lot and put some cups out there and then you can play
607996 we are worried about people claiming we did this this and this we renovated the bathroom on the second floor but you still cant get in the three steps at the front door
607997 picture yourself as a small to medium sized business saying to yourself what is this all about what changes do i need to make
607998 figuring out the changes you may need to make or not make thats an enormous amount of time and legal fees

608000 torontos waterfront is a problem which has been dealt with in a piecemeal fashion by city councils of the past
608001 and theres a natural frustration because weve had so many studies on the waterfront over the past decades
608002 bids have a way of putting deadlines on achieving your goals
608003 theres nothing like avoiding a red face to make politicians act
608004 is a 10 year plan to turn the 46 km of our waterfront into the greatest people place in the world well reshape this front porch to our city as a seamless whole instead of a patchwork quilt its going to happen
608005 we had the capacity to build something from scratch where we could showcase the best of canada
608006 dont forget why we started this to make sure the city of toronto was always on the leading edge and we were going to move from a good city to a great city
608007 previous waterfront plans were all based around olympics and i think it would have been a boondoggle and we wouldnt have gotten what we really wanted out of that
608008 losing the olympics might have actually helped our waterfront in many ways we would have had a 100 000 seat stadium in the port lands and all these things that im not sure would have been the best use of the land down there in the long run
608009 were like a submarine were going full steam ahead but its underwater and no one can see us
608010 its starting to move but im not even sure the turtle has lifted his head out of his shell yet
608011 at this pace ill be dead and buried on the waterfront before its a place people can be proud of
608012 its hard for the good old waterfront to buy a good story and its unfortunate
608013 theres some really good work being done and being planned
608014 we write to a narrative and that narrative has been that toronto doesnt have a good waterfront it doesnt have a waterfront as good as chicago and none of that is true
608015 very few city waterfronts have done that at the end of the day all the ducks have been lined up and youre going to see one hell of a waterfront being developed in fact its already here
608016 and in a year or so theyll see it starting to take shape
608017 we decided we had to remove his name and just pray that he was alive somewhere
608018 this is just my goal in life to make sure these people who lost their lives are never forgotten never forgotten

608031 to keep doujons memory alive i would like to use this facebook page as an online petition to rename the park next to the lake where doujon grew up and where i met doujon for the first time many years ago
608032 the scene was overwhelming and i cant explain the stench
608033 every room was filled with animals and they were in the beds and everywhere
608034 youll agree that the yatra is run by the board and the arrangements are fine you can ask the pilgrims there is nothing to worry when the situation is normal then we will move ahead in my next meeting i hope to make some progress
608035 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
608036 why did you leave such a sunny place like italy to move to england
608037 its just good to see folks come back young and old and ride the train and smile to see what it was like back in the 1920s
608038 pada pukul 10 30 pagi pihak polis menerima arahan daripada jabatan kerja raya dan dewan bandaraya kuala lumpur supaya menutup laluan tersebut
608039 were always thinking what do we need to do to get more kids playing
608040 thousands of girls jump rope but they do it as a recreational sport just for fun for it to be in the schools that means its getting good recognition as a sport
608041 you have to do an aerial which is like a flip
608042 you have to do a rapid dance with some fancy footwork you have to do a rope trick and you have to do a cheer an ending that your whole team takes part in
608043 double dutch is a sport that gets girls involved no matter what their condition is
608044 jumping double dutch was one of the requirements of being outside
608045 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
608046 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
608047 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
608048 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
608049 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
608050 to me the evening has always been the best time of the day on the beach the light the birds the sounds i love it
608051 im glad that now i cant get kicked off if i want to hang out after sunset
608052 the ordinance is very narrow people can stroll or sit on the beach but thats about it
608053 i dont think they were thinking straight when they said you should have 24 hour access to the beaches
608054 i think when everyone first heard about it they really worried about what could go on in the middle of the night on the beach
608055 people are in bed in the middle of the night here
608056 maybe in towns where bars close late they could have more problems but we just dont have gangs of people running out and making noise or problems on the beach in the middle of the night
608057 it boggles my mind that ocean city doesnt understand the liability of 24 hour beach access
608058 i think that ocean city went along with it just to get a beach fill
608059 that doctrine envisions that people have the right to enjoy the beaches at all times not just 9 to 5
608060 if there are extenuating circumstances for a town not wanting to comply we are willing to work with a municipality
608061 but maintaining public access 24 7 is our primary goal
608062 i could never have predicted the career ive had the good fortune ive had
608063 ive worked hard but ive also been in the right place at the right time it takes both it really does
608064 he had great presence in front of a jury and not everyone does
608065 and he didnt do it by being flamboyant he wasnt a screamer he was just very well prepared and matter of fact and focused
608066 with all due respect to my brethren in law enforcement we catch the dumb ones
608067 he should have had an independent counsel investigating this from the beginning and investigating all four caucuses
608068 and if its a republican its going to irritate me more
608069 i stand here and take it i know what were doing and were doing the right thing
608070 anyone who calls this a witch hunt is from neptune pluto or mars
608071 you can do more for the people of pennsylvania in this job than in any other government job in the state
608072 certainly the issues that are playing out on the world stage have taken precedence over the games and the competition in the games
608073 if the chinese believe that the olympics failed or were badly tarnished because of foreign actions whether demonstrations or media coverage chinas reaction will be sharply negative
608074 this is perhaps the most exciting games weve ever broadcast
608075 people sometimes ask me why the hell did you give the games to beijing in 2001
608076 international olympic committee president jacques rogge said earlier this year
608077 well the pollution situation in 2001 according to the world health organizations standards was not a problem
608078 they have infused large amounts of resources behind their sports programs
608079 theyve developed incredible olympic pipelines 2008 is just the beginning
608080 as a result china russia and the united states will all vie for the top gold medal and overall medal count
608081 by hosting the beijing games we will show the world that the chinese people are a peace loving nation
608082 take readers on a journey through their celebrated young lives pausing to reflect on what has helped shape them into who they are today
608083 when you pick up a 2 foot 8 inch human being and throw him to the floor it hurts
608084 a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less than average career
608085 she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of a sudden she has all these kids
608086 a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied but she has no talent
608087 im sure paris would tell you that herself shes a very sweet nice girl but thats it
608088 tears may flow as we take this time to honor lt jason mann
608089 hes a hero he wasnt just a hero to his family hes a hero to this country
608090 he was a wonderful wonderful son not just a wonderful marine
608091 i dont think he would want us to say he was a hero today but he loved being a marine most of all he loved his wife and daughter and we grieve that he wont be here for them
608092 mom you just need to put me in gods hands
608093 now when people ask me hows your brother doing ill say he died doing what he believed in hes being honored and remembered my brother is a hero and now he serves the lord as a family we have never felt so much pain and pride for the sacrifice my brother made
608094 this is all just showboatin see this guy right here you think he can do anything about the economy the economy runs on its own cycles no matter whos in there
608095 the effects of leaders are very strong in autocratic settings but much less so in the presence of democratic institutions
608096 i think most people parents and children appreciate the choice
608097 you can decide what school you want to attend and that appeals to people
608098 if you run a good operation then you make a profit but you wont get any students if you are bad
608099 you have to do a good job to get money that is even more important for a private school
608100 a beacon being more marketlike than any other among rich countries
608101 its not a very marketlike program but since its the best thing around in the rich world its definitely worth watching
608102 it is a model that is clearly working and we need to learn from that
608103 i assure you there are bases around the country that are closed today because of overdevelopment outside the gate its this type of community support which has kept the bases open
608104 will provide a blueprint for ocean and burlington counties and their towns to protect the bases from encroachment and protect the 17 000 people who work there
608105 we need to ensure that the elevated activities on the base over the next 10 years work harmoniously with the towns and their land use plans that transportation issues are addressed and that any new residential and commercial development addresses both the communities needs as well as those of the military
608106 it stands to reason that more military activity means more commercial activity in the housing market however new development into the areas closest to the base is also an issue and also has to be considered as part of the planning effort
608107 incompatible land uses such as residential housing in a flight crash zone
608108 maybe it would be better to have a warehouse or a golf course
608109 some land has been purchased were looking for other opportunities
608110 encroachment limits our ability to do the mission were here to do if we cant do our mission it will have to go elsewhere
608111 were looking for ways to benefit the bases and the people living around them
608112 wrightstown wants to complement the bases what can we build here that you need and dont want to build on the base
608113 were looking for common goals where there is a win win situation for everybody
608114 this was his second job just to pay all the bills

608128 lebendtiere k nnten nach den agrarrohstoffen die n chste gro e welle werden
608129 als reaktion auf die gestiegenen sojabohnen und maispreise schlachten die landwirte ihr vieh
608130 mittelfristig d rften die preise massiv anziehen insbesondere f r rinder und gefl gel
608131 wenn die maispreise steigen bleiben die tiere l nger auf der weide statt in den mastbetrieb zu gehen
608132 in der vergangenheit gab es immer wieder massive seuchen zuletzt etwa die schweinepest in china
608133 nach einer solchen seuche geht die nachfrage zur ck was nat rlich auf den preis durchschl gt die auswirkungen sp ren wir zum teil noch heute
608134 zum einen wegen der hohen futterkosten zum anderen wegen der grunds tzlich steigenden fleischnachfrage
608135 eine rezession k nnte 2008 zwar den absatz drosseln langfristig erwarten wir aber ein beschleunigtes nachfragewachstum weil die fleischindustrie marktanteile in japan und s dkorea zur ckgewinnen d rfte
608136 au erdem d rfte der wachsende wohlstand in zahlreichen schwellenl ndern die nachfrage nach hochwertigem rindfleisch antreiben
608137 herr seehofer hat sich in k rzester zeit umentschieden wir h tten gerne einen verl sslichen partner gehabt die ampel ist eine reine alibi politik

608139 jeder kunde bewertet ganz instinktiv die produkte einige wandern mit schlechtem gewissen in den einkaufswagen f r andere loben wir uns unbewusst
608140 die industrie musste auf druck des marktes reagieren inzwischen kann durch die kennzeichnung das image eines herstellers verbessert werden
608141 das w re auch in deutschland der gew nschte effekt
608142 ich glaube nicht dass kennzeichnungen gravierende auswirkungen auf den verbraucher haben
608143 wenn die politik glaubt auf den aufgekl rten verbraucher im kampf gegen das bergewicht setzen zu k nnen setzt sie aufs falsche pferd
608144 i will not sellout to any big company because they are all the same protecting their interests
608145 people before have had similar inventions to mine and they have sold out and nothing has been heard of then inventions again
608146 i dont know whether the americans want to buy it to use it or to take it right of the market and protect their oil interests
608147 i think that while there is a drop of oil left in the world they will try to stop alternate power sources so i will ignore their offer
608148 companies that sell petrol and industrial gas have invested millions of dollars in plant and steel bottles they dont want to know about an invention that can use 10 gallons of water to produce enough gas for 6 weeks work or to run a car
608149 only one australian firm has approached me since i announced the perfection of my method last week but i would like to see all the other developments take place here
608150 if ever we can ascertain at what period the earths charge when disturbed oscillates we shall know a fact possibly of the greatest importance to the welfare of the human race
608151 if an older and respected scientist says something is possible he is almost certainly correct if he says that something is impossible he is very likely mistaken
608152 the universal one divides his time by the periodicities of his inhalations and exhalations which together make one universal constant of energy and subdivides it into four exactly equal unit constants of energy these periodicities and tonal and mid tonal subdivisions measure the dimensions of his idea in the illusion of form space time sex temperature and other periodicities

608156 obviously it takes more than one sign to have a small business
608157 its very difficult to operate a small business in the county
608158 we were just hearing a lot of complaints regarding getting permits and getting their businesses opened
608159 when youre trying to open a business a delay will cause business owners money
608160 theyve all indicated that theyd be willing to work with us
608161 nobody has approached us to have a meeting to address any concerns
608162 wed be open to discussing any concerns they would have
608163 until they get an anonymous complaint they dont do anything
608164 there is a lack of consistency from store to store in terms of how the code is interpreted and enforced
608165 the adults listened to us and worked with us side by side
608166 there was no idea that was just thrown out without a lot of thought
608167 we try to supply people with the basic needs but if there is someone who needs some additional support we try to refer them to their center
608168 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
608169 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
608170 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
608171 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
608172 from the bombs there is no dead two people were admitted to songkhla hospital
608173 future computers may weigh no more than 1 5 tons

608176 i saw the report that was filed and there were false statements
608177 she was run out of the schools by the principal
608178 it wasnt a vacation he felt that was the best way to recover
608179 if a teacher goes out sick the school has to get a substitute to take over those classrooms
608180 because i often like to write on the back of cards
608181 i want to get on board as soon as possible but my risk tolerance in the online gaming economy industry is much lower than others ill join after first quarter profits are reported to stock markets and investors
608182 budhram sully is right about these particular areas of concern but i believe online gaming economy business can still move forward and can still burst through any barriers of entry in the respective market take www seagate com for example this website came out of no where to be considered one of the top 1000 websites on the web today we think that our online gaming economy knowledge is superior to all others and with the research skills of island younes of www fco gov we are sure to turn a profit
608183 im happy to see that my collegue steffani ruuska believes in this project
608184 this project will help all involved greatly and will move things forward dramatically
608185 we need a few venture capitalists with guts and cash
608186 i want this online gaming economy project to take off and go somewhere and your support in this online gaming economy event is a great start
608187 i see good things for this online gaming economy startup company
608188 and you can bet the ranch that things are only going to get better

608195 the only reason we took this middle eastern gaming policy case to court was so we might avoid having to pay settlement fees now however we will be paying out to the plaintiffs though no more than our risk team originally budgeted
608196 with students working hard on their middle eastern gaming policy law mid term exams ive been able to assist the lafromboise seamen and domenica bribiesca law team in the recent middle eastern gaming policy class action case this is proving to be a very good experience for me and it will dynamically boost the breadth of my curicular offerings as my pre law department advances
608197 well be doing mock middle eastern gaming policy class action lawsuit summations on friday
608198 and grades will be based on presentation efficacy of argument use of facts and argument coherence
608199 which probably means that well win this case handily the case put forth by my boss santina milich was so convincing that we believe the jury will only be out for a couple days before they render their decision
608200 im excited to be litigating this middle eastern gaming policy case with my colleague delfina jourdain a distinguished attorney with more than 25 years experience
608201 and we firmly believe that the middle eastern gaming policy case we have prepared for the 3 judge tribunal is rock solid
608202 were working closely with the lead partners at the orgeron wauneka and rohr ahlin law firm to develop our new middle eastern gaming policy law curriculum

608206 we were told how to condition pows in a training course before the war even started
608207 the comments made by adam ingram that this was not widespread and des brownes statement that it may have happened but only by a small minority is complete horses
608208 statements were taken last month in damascus from hospital workers who say they saw the bodies of iraqis handed over by the soldiers for burial they claim the bodies show evidence of gouged out eyes serious injuries to genitals asphyxiation and hanging

608212 fraizer campbell has taken his goal very well and it wont do him any harm hes an aggressive young player
608213 we are also hoping to apply for a work permit for manucho who comes from angola that will give us more back up
608214 michael carrick and wayne rooney have been struggling with a virus for a few days and they wont be fit for the juventus game on wednesday hopefully they will be ready for the community shield next sunday

608233 the pakistan peoples party will support any solution agreeable to all three parties namely pakistan india and the kashmiris
608234 in kashmir campaigns of murderous cruelty have been sustained for decades when the population gets tired of militant insurgency the repression seems to subside but when an act of police or paramilitary savagery is protested the orgy of murder and rape is re enacted
608235 barbarous campaigns in kashmir enjoy a complete immunity from criticism or condemnation by indians a huge blanket of self righteousness is spread over the savage scene and the actual goings on are permitted little exposure
608236 the indian posture of admitting no wrong is receiving much encouragement from the very world powers that loudly swear a commitment to human rights

608281 fundamentalmente nosotros no queremos tener ni hacer nosotros solamente queremos ser y usamos el tener y el hacer para ese prop sito adem s nuestra voluntad para ser no est contenta con nada ella busca su meta m s all de los l mites fastidiosos del tener y el hacer el hombre no estar realmente feliz hasta que sea conscientemente uno con dios y comparta la libertad de esa nica realidad
608282 saber no es pensar el saber comienza cuando el pensar cesa y termina su trabajo cada conocimiento nuevo es un deleite porque es una experiencia nueva de la unidad
608283 es necesario realizar que el cuerpo no es consciente sino que nosotros estamos conscientes del cuerpo y tambi n que la mente no es consciente sino que nosotros somos consciente de ella
608284 todas las cosas en su n cleo son lo mismo as que asirse a una y descartar otra es vivir en la ilusi n una mente no es un juez adecuado ni propio para juzgarse a ella misma ella es prejuiciada en su propio favor o en su contra ella no puede ver nada objetivamente
608285 al igual que uno no necesita buscar fuera de uno mismo la luz igualmente uno no necesita buscar fuera de su propia existencia personal peque a una oportunidad mayor y sin limites con esta realizaci n llega la muerte final del ego smo del odio del fanatismo de la satisfacci n propia y de la estupidez
608286 argumentar implica el deseo de ganar fortalece el ego smo y nos ata
608287 sabes que mis monedas son falsas pero las aceptas de todas formas junto con mi desfachatez y mi fingimiento
608288 se nos advierte que incluso este samadhi superior no es el logro en s mismo sino solamente ese acto ltimo y supremo de la mente en la cual ella se estabiliza en su vuelo supremo en l que conoce su propia insuficiencia y se rinde se nos advierte que estamos mirando la luz del amanecer y no el sol completo pero oh qu maravillosa alborada es esa alz ndose sobre la oscuridad del mundo e iluminando cada parte de l
608289 la bienaventuranza no se encuentra en nada que pueda ser considerado o medido o contado sino solamente en eso que el ojo no ha visto
608290 el hombre que vive sin apetencias habiendo descartado los deseos sin ser posesivo ni ego sta ese hombre logra la paz ste es el estado brahm nico habiendo obtenido esto uno no est confundido estando establecido en esto al final del tiempo de cada uno uno alcanza incluso el nirvana de brahman
608291 el que tiene igualdad de apreciaci n o valoraci n hacia los que le desean el bien hacia los amigos enemigos ajenos neutrales los que le odian y los parientes e incluso hacia los santos y pecadores ese aventaja supera y sobresale a los dem s
608292 hay solamente una cosa por la que dios me ha enviado a este mundo para desarrollar cada clase de virtud y fortaleza y no hay nada en el mundo que no pueda usar para ese prop sito
608293 sabed que cuando aprenden se liberan as alcanzar n el amado no hay otro secreto que yo sepa para ser discernido no hay nada m s que eso
608294 pon un pez en la tierra y recordar el oc ano hasta que muera pon un p jaro en una jaula y todav a no olvidar el cielo cada uno permanece a orando su verdadero hogar el lugar donde su naturaleza ha decretado que debe ser
608295 el hombre nace en el estado de inocencia su naturaleza original es amor gracia y pureza aun as indiferentemente l emigra y sin siquiera pensar en su hogar
608296 no es esto m s pesaroso que los peces y los p jaros
608297 la realidad externa aparece como tal a la mente que ha sido distorsionada por los sedimentos ps quicos aparte de la mente ninguna realidad externa existe percibirla ser a una distorsi n absoluta
608298 para fortalecer la mente no necesitamos moverla constantemente como hacemos cuando queremos fortalecer el cuerpo sino que le damos una pausa y la ponemos a descansar
608299 por supuesto que hay docenas de t cnicas para la meditaci n pero todas ellas se resumen a esto simplemente deja que todo sea camina hacia ac donde est tranquilo lejos de la batalla por qu no le damos una oportunidad y lo tratamos
608300 la sonrisa de tu fisonom a es espect culo suficiente el sonido de tu nombre es canci n suficiente por qu me cortas con tus flechas mortales cuando la sombra de tu llanto es raz n suficiente
608301 desde siempre la mente nunca ha tenido una existencia real para l que ha realizado la consciencia a trav s de la din mica de la mente y sus condiciones establecidas toda lucha y b squeda parecer como un esfuerzo f til de cosechar en el espacio
608302 si quieres lo que la realidad visible puede dar eres un empleado si quieres el mundo invisible no est s viviendo tu verdad ambos deseos son tontos pero ser s perdonado por olvidar que lo que realmente quieres es la felicidad confusa del amor
608303 para una rana que nunca ha dejado su charco el oc ano parece como una aventura mira a lo que ella est renunciando seguridad en este mundo y reconocimiento la rana simplemente se niega no puedo realmente explicar como es donde yo vivo pero alg n d a te llevar all
608304 sigue caminando aunque no hay ning n lugar donde llegar no trates de mirar a trav s de la distancia eso no es para los seres humanos mu vete en tu interior pero no te muevas de la forma que el miedo te hace mover camina en el pozo gira como la tierra y la luna giran rotando alrededor de lo que aman cualquier cosa que rote llega del centro
608305 no hay ninguna dificultad cuando se trata del camino perfecto s lo que debemos evitar el hacer discriminaciones cuando estamos libres del odio y del amor eso se revelar a s mismo tan claro y amplio como la luz del d a
608306 cuando veo tus cielos obra de tus dedos la luna y las estrellas que t formaste digo qu es el hombre para que tengas de l memoria
608307 luchando para dejar lo salvaje llegas a ser parte de ello luchando para dejar de asirse es en s mismo asirse as que c mo ganas el control y llegas m s all del deseo abre esos ojos esos que han nacido en tu propia calavera
608308 dos cosas llenan la mente con una admiraci n y una reverencia que van perennemente en aumento mientras m s frecuente la mente piensa en ellas m s intensamente la mente se dirige a ellas los cielos brillantes sobre m y la ley moral dentro de m
608309 en este mundo el que oye escucha solamente al orador que trata con hechos de conocimiento los cuales son necesarios y deseados
608310 el gran conocimiento es pausado y amplio el peque o conocimiento es tortuoso y caprichoso las grandes palabras resplandecen con distinci n y m ritos las peque as palabras les fascina hacer distinciones
608311 cuando abro mis ojos al mundo exterior me siento como una gota de agua en el oc ano pero cuando cierro mis ojos y miro interiormente veo el universo completo como una burbuja levant ndose en oc ano de mi coraz n
608312 yo soy aquel al que amo y l al que yo amo es yo somos dos esp ritus viviendo en un cuerpo si me miras lo ves a l y si lo miras a l nos est s mirando a ambos
608313 en este momento este amor viene a descansar en m muchos seres en un solo ser en un grano de trigo miles de manojos de heno dentro del ojo de una aguja una noche de estrellas en espiral
608314 sigue caminando aunque no hay lugar donde llegar no trates de ver a trav s de la distancia eso no es para los seres humanos mu vete interiormente pero no te muevas de forma que el miedo te haga mover
608315 camina hacia el pozo gira como la tierra y la luna giran rotando alrededor de lo que aman cualquier cosa que circula llega del centro
608316 como la lluvia cae igualmente sobre el justo y el injusto deja tu coraz n est en paz por no juzgar y que tu bondad llueva sobre todos
608317 esta dimensi n material es simplemente el samsara cuando la miras est s mirando el samsara en toda su extensi n pero qu significa nada m s y nada menos que nombres y formas cambiantes pero cuando el ego se extingue t experimentas ese flujo y es bello no simplemente porque es deslumbrante sino porque el hecho de verlo como es necesita del olvido del ego el velo del ego es levantado y ves claramente
608318 cuando abro mis ojos al mundo exterior me siento como una gota de agua en el oc ano pero cuando cierro mis ojos y observo en mi interior veo el universo entero como una burbuja que se levanta del oc ano de mi coraz n
608319 ante la ley del se or est su delicia y en su ley medita de d a y de noche
608320 enardeci se mi coraz n dentro de m encendi se fuego en mi meditaci n y as profer con mi lengua
608321 pr ncipes tambi n se sentaron y hablaron contra m mas tu ciervo meditaba en tus estatutos
608322 cu nto amo yo tu ley todo el d a en ella mi meditaci n
608323 al igual que uno que est llevando una l mpara con los ojos ve todos los objetos as tambi n l que ha o do la ley moral llegar a ser perfectamente sabio
608324 el odio nunca cesar en este mundo a trav s de odiar sino a trav s de amar sta es una verdad eterna vence el enojo con amor vence la maldad con la bondad vence el ego smo con la generosidad vence la mentira con la verdad
608325 mas a vosotros los que o s digo amad vuestros enemigos haced bien los que aborrecen bendecid los que os maldicen y orad por los que os calumnian y al que te hiriere en la mejilla dale tambi n la otra y al que te quitare la capa ni aun el sayo le defiendas y cualquiera que te pidiere da y al que tomare lo que es tuyo no vuelvas pedir
608326 la infelicidad es el resultado de la aceptaci n del hombre al servilismo debido a la condici n baja de su propia mente
608327 cuando hay incomodidad por los malos pensamientos reflexionemos acerca de ellos
608328 si quieres ver mira instant neamente cuando comienzas a pensar pierdes lo que est s viendo
608329 el deseo puede atraparnos igualmente que a un p jaro que ve comida en una trampa l sabe que ser atrapado pero su deseo es el causante de que cierre los ojos y act e como si la trampa no existiera
608330 mientras m s sabidur a tenga una persona mayor ser su humildad
608331 sin amor nada tiene valor puedes experimentar toda clase de estados y tener toda clase de habilidades ps quicas pero si no sabes como amar ellos equivalen a nada
608332 leyendo la historia de los emperadores y las dinast as en quietud uno no siente nada profundo acerca de los cambios y caprichos del pasado solamente cuando uno experimenta los retos variados y las dificultades en la vida es que uno gana el entendimiento completo de la impermanencia en los asuntos mundanos
608333 ning n conocimiento acerca de las cosas simples hace a nadie reflexivo es s lo el conocimiento del valor de las cosas para el ser viviente o el uso propio de las cosas por los seres humanos y para ellos lo que constituye la sabidur a la sabidur a llega cuando hay igualmente coraz n y mente cuando hay sensitividad para la vida y preocupaci n para c mo la vida ser afectada
608334 el enojo no se remover por estar enojado con l sino por nuestro entendimiento de l sin embargo la intenci n de nuestro entendimiento no es removerlo sino observar lo que realmente est pasando en la mente y sobre qu la emoci n turbulenta se ha escabullido
608335 la armon a es la entrada de dios en la mente para que la mente act e en obediencia a la ley que est por encima de la mente y esa ley es la unidad
608336 la unidad es la naturaleza de dios y la armon a es su expresi n en la mente y en los trabajos de la mente
608337 cuando el yo gana su independencia de su propia locura y estupidez porque nadie lo est dirigiendo todo llega a ser claro y el tiempo y el espacio que son productos de la acci n y el pensamiento y son parte del sue o desaparecer n
608338 si quieres encontrar el origen de cualquier problema busca en el lucro y la codicia
608339 nada en el mundo es bueno ni malo sino que el pensamiento lo hace as
608340 cuando comienzas a reconocer que el sufrimiento es una gracia y un privilegio no puedes creerlo piensas que est s haciendo trampa
608341 hace falta un gran valor para abandonarse a s mismo renunciar al
608342 zen es el cultivo del yo pero si se usan m todos err neos terminamos atascados en contienda y en porf a cultivando en ego ficticio
608343 en el momento que entiendes como tu sufrimiento ha llegado est s ya en el camino para liberarte de l
608344 lo que la naturaleza ha dejado imperfecto el arte lo perfecciona
608345 un hombre que no pasa a trav s del infierno de sus pasiones nunca las vencer ellas entonces viven en la casa de al lado y en cualquier momento una llama puede entrar y quemar su propia casa cuando nosotros renunciamos y dejamos atr s las cosas olvid ndolas siempre est el peligro de que las cosas que descuidamos regresen con m s fuerza
608346 lo que pasa dentro de uno mismo cuando uno integra previamente contenidos inconscientes en la conciencia es algo que puede ser dificilmente ser descrito en palabras puede ser solamente experimentado es un asunto subjetivo relativamente m s all de la discusi n
608347 cuando uno sigue el camino de la individuaci n de la determinaci n de vivir su propia vida uno debe contar con los errores como parte del negocio la vida no ser a completa sin ellos no hay garant a ni por un segundo que no caigamos en el error o tropecemos pereciendo mortalmente podemos pensar que hay un camino seguro pero ese ser a el camino de la muerte
608348 he realizado que uno debe aceptar los pensamientos que est n dentro de uno y en armon a con ellos mismos como parte de la realidad propia las categor as de verdaderos y falsos est n siempre presentes por supuesto pero porque ellas no son parte de ellos toman un segundo lugar la presencia de pensamientos es m s importante que nuestro juicio subjetivo de ellos pero ninguno de los dos debe ser suprimido porque los ltimos tambi n son pensamientos existentes los cuales son parte de nuestra totalidad
608349 dado que la conciencia como resultado de su espacio temporal relativo posee or genes mejores de informaci n que la mente consciente la cual solamente tiene percepciones sensoriales disponibles para ella somos dependientes de nuestras falsedades en la vida despu s de la muerte de las escasas indicaciones de los sue os y revelaciones espont neas similares del inconsciente
608350 intercepta el mundo intermediario de la imaginaci n m tica y la mente caer victima de la rigidez doctrinaria e inflexible
608351 el hombre occidental parece predominantemente extravertido y el oriental predominantemente introvertido el primero proyecta el significado y considera que existe en los objetos el ltimo siente el significado en l mismo pero el significado est en ambos exterior e interior
608352 una creencia me prueba solamente el fen meno de la creencia no el contenido de ella
608353 the failure to conduct a meaningful inquiry into the facts or review any of the relevant bid submission paperwork before making such reckless allegations should be disappointing to all
608354 sba may want to examine its size decision to confirm whether it made the proper finding and determine whether it is appropriate for blackwater affiliates to continue receiving small business set aside contracts
608355 in order to be able to fulfill its obligations under the contract it appears that blackwater was required to do more than merely hire and train the security professionals and provide them to the state department
608356 expert accounting and outside legal counsel have determined that blackwaters classification of security personnel as independent contractors is reasonable correct and legally protected
608357 we are latinos and we will never be ashamed of our parents or our origin and we pledge to defend our community
608358 as children affected by the raid we demand that they stop the raids and we ask all immigrant communities for support
608359 this town is destroyed now there is no peace and people are leaving to go somewhere else my brother was one of the people detained in the plant and hes still in prison this is an injustice and we need a lot of support from the community
608360 as we have unraveled the trojan horse of jobs it has become clear that we must be demanding more than just the eir we need to demand that the warehouse be shutdown under no certain terms will the community accept 2700 trucks daily spewing diesel particulate matter that can kill us under no certain terms will we accept our children our schools nevin carver jefferson our parks ross snyder recreation our pedestrian areas vernon metro station alameda swap meet to be exhausted by diesel particulate matter
608361 i stepped out of the park to get some ice the officers told me i couldnt return because they said i had alcohol i told them it was only ice
608362 they thought i was drunk and they just came at me they started swinging and hitting me with the batons
608363 let me be clear he is maintaining that he absolutely did not do anything they say he did
608364 he never took a swing at them he never was aggressive to them
608365 the most interesting one i saw had the famous picture of
608366 tees these t shirts were worn by all ages but i was quite surprised to see so many young black men rocking them from age 12 30
608367 the white liberal differs from the white conservative only in one way the liberal is more deceitful than the conservative
608368 so many whites want to be able to say im not one of them those bad whites
608369 hes a remarkably exotic variety of the faux african american but a wigger nonetheless
608370 even genetically obama whose east african descent is apparent in his unusual features has only a distant relationship to the west africans who are the ancestors of almost all african americans
608371 the plain fact is that they black americans tend to possess poorer native judgment than members of better educated groups thus they need stricter moral guidance from society
608372 hang em high in the street for all the people to see
608373 if i get on that jury ill hang that jew for sure
608374 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
608375 it is has a great deal to do with the natural conditions
608376 over the last two days the air quality has been level one good
608377 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
608378 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
608379 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
608380 senator obama is an impressive orator and its a lucky thing for me that people arent just choosing a motivational speaker
608381 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
608382 what john mccain has done in the last week has really shown the american people he doesnt want to talk about the economy or foreign policy or healthcare
608383 he is increasingly going to take his campaign into the gutter i think john mccain has harmed himself in the last week really eroding any capital he had built up in terms of the kind of politician he is
608384 before and immediately after august 8 we will not see persistent heavy rainfall
608385 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
608386 it is impossible to tell at what time the rain will fall on august 8 but we cannot exclude that there will be periodic rain then
608387 and for the moment we can only work with small clouds if the conditions are appropriate we may try to put in some plans
608388 normally a typhoon can affect an area for one or two days
608389 it would not have a long term effect but would only have an effect for a limited period
608390 amori tempeste sogni e poemi mary shelley nel golfo dei poeti
608391 per parliamo e parliamo parole senza denti e amore vano
608392 pu sprigionarsi dalla fanghiglia della lingua colloquiale e di comunicazione
608393 ho pensato ad una serenata il 12 agosto davanti alla casa dove vive giudici illuminata la sua finestra che si specchia sul mare io e la mia macchina per scrivere valentine originale quelloggetto disegnato da sottssas nel 1969 che oggi vive al moma di new york
608394 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
608395 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
608396 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
608397 probably if we hadnt scored when we did the change would have been made for the right reason
608398 this is my team and we almost had a chance to win it out there
608399 hey i can only do my job and i cant do anything about what other people do if thats a decision they want to make i cant do anything about it
608400 telepresence is our response to the current green issue especially in the contact center industry that involves executives frequently flying in and out of the country
608401 for us its about how do we bring world class systems and capacity to relevant countries like australia
608402 for us this means bandwidth take up in the provinces
608403 we suddenly had requirements for high bandwidth leased circuits when there was no demand for this before from our end
608404 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
608405 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
608406 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
608407 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole
608408 south korea is a leading testbed for the it industry and the internet media here certainly has a frontier like aspect in leading experimental democracy
608409 but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information
608410 if you want to sue me with the cyber defamation law go ahead history will charge you with insulting south koreans
608411 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
608412 clearly theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
608413 after we won the competition we were given an additional 2 000 as production budget to create the viral video it took us one day to create the first video then another one day for the re shoot
608414 the soldiers were hot on the trails of the escaping terrorists mountain residents reported that the fleeing enemies were carrying heavily wounded companions
608415 wala siyang kaaway kaya wala siyang bodyguard gusto lang niyang pagandahin at paasensuhin ang agno kaya siya nag mayor he did not need bodyguards because he had no enemies he wanted to develop agno so he ran for mayor
608416 the situation in pangasinan is becoming different now why is it that there have been many killings in the province and not one has been solved
608417 we are happy to be together working for peace again
608418 its very essential very important because one if they know the problem of the rebels they know the systems that go with that
608419 im not taking them to that because it might be misinterpreted as much as possible i will not let them do that
608420 tension is brewing in mindanao and old wounds are being reopened unnecessarily because of this controversial grp government of the republic of the philippines milf ancestral domain accord
608421 to defuse the tension we are asking malaca ang to defer the signing of the moa in deference to the supreme court
608422 the government owes it to the people of mindanao to explain what this agreement is all about
608423 in the interest of peace and stability we hope that they will divulge the terms of the accord to the people of mindanao at the soonest possible time
608424 it is unfortunate for both muslims and christians in the philippines that gma arroyos initials has polluted the peace process by negotiating in bad faith promising the milf things she cannot deliver using the process as a backdoor to charter change and ultimately setting the conditions for escalating the conflict in mindanao
608425 ancestral domain does not form part of the philippines public domain
608426 with this gma has effectively ceded part of the territory of the philippines to the milf
608427 obviously gma is not empowered to give up any part of our country to any group only the filipino people can do that in their sovereign capacity and only via amending the constitution
608428 numbers do not lie every day you pick up the papers and what you find is alarming news
608429 we as government officials have to look for ways to ease the pain
608430 the current law was passed in 1994 when the economy was booming and there were plenty of jobs
608431 but today we are losing jobs and people need more time to be able to go back to work
608432 i had to ask myself how a family of four making minimum wage can survive in new york
608433 when new yorkers find their resources stretched thin the food stamp program puts meals on millions of tables
608434 extending the program would offer fast relief for those struggling to make ends meet
608435 were in the middle of a housing crisis in the whole country and belleville has been hit by it now theyre sitting there making it more difficult for the building industry the people the realtors investors and landlords we have small minded people in government who want to have big ideas and control
608436 i was told it was going to be for new construction only but i have since learned that its citywide its not just for new construction
608437 it doesnt appear that the city has followed the law
608438 a change in a zoning ordinance cannot be made retroactive if its more restrictive
608439 to try to say retroactively that you are now nonconforming ive got a real serious problem with that a challenger to this law will raise a constitutional question and argue that they have taken his property in violation of the fifth amendment
608440 generally speaking you have to make allowances for the existing property rights
608441 im like a big person trapped in a little persons body
608442 but i knew it was right right away and i was willing to work hard
608443 i dont back down ive had screaming matches on the floor if somebody starts something ill take out somebody twice my size
608444 were just here for the weekend getting away for some fun
608445 were on a pretty tight leash but thats ok were there to win not to sightsee or visit our families
608446 it was my first major competition and i told them you dont have to play me
608447 it was something and now i get to do it again
608448 i lift every day work on shooting and pushing and i do some chair skills
608449 all of us have jobs or families or are in school three women are married and one has two kids
608450 we scrimmage with the mens u of i wheelchair team because our team is spread out all over the country texas colorado alabama nebraska champaign
608451 its interesting because were all friends but we still compete against each other
608452 i knew shed be a great player the team needed a class 1 and a good teacher because we had a lot of inexperienced players
608453 one of my strengths is that im smart in the game
608454 im good at setting the pick i can think two steps ahead my job is to get patty and the shooter open
608455 she doesnt get the credit she deserves for what she does on the court
608456 if you told emily she couldnt do something look out
608457 it always killed me when i saw animals behind bars
608458 i tell people the animals think youre here so they can look at you
608459 you have large groups of new yorkers who have grown up with this zoo in one form or another
608460 in new york city a lot of kids dont get the experience of seeing animals in their natural habitat
608461 if they learn about animals and where they come from they learn to respect them
608462 i thought wed let the baby gorilla use the name in the meantime
608463 patty cake is still new york citys no 1 gorilla grande dame
608464 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
608465 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
608466 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
608467 in practice this means that there will be no basis on which a worker can make his choice
608468 meetings are not held under a constant threat and can therefore be truly productive
608469 ive seen many hot shots try to hit home runs with little experience without learning to simply get base hits and doubles first success comes with small steps and knowledge not one great play no matter how memorable
608470 so as a result when we interview people we try to find out how their strengths and weaknesses can compliment our current team
608471 having you game together before you go for an interview is absolutely key to making it out in one piece if your top choice is company a do some practice interviews at companies b and c before attempting your top job choice
608472 vaugh brewer an casino computer programmer volunteers industry veteran was our top choice for vice president of sales and marketing
608473 and we recruited heavily for this position basically we wanted someone with a lot of experience and sales experience
608474 look if they can get you for less they will offer you less the object of any negotiation is to settle on terms that are parties agree upon and when it comes to remuneration dont sell yourself short
608475 the people i was surrounded with made me feel like this is home
608476 it has a real industrial feel exposed brick concrete floors a fireplace granite hardtop counters and stainless steel appliances
608477 there are lots of hidden gems and so much positive energy
608478 its a city but its also a small town in terms of who you run into
608479 you can walk to restaurants museums its not far from downtown and its a vibrant urban neighborhood
608480 younger people in particular have less of a fear of crime
608481 they know that no matter where you are its a reality theyre more street smart about things plus in midtown we have two layers of police protection wayne state and the detroit police department
608482 its not so much about real estate but about the lifestyle
608483 it reaches more people and people pass it along to their friends
608484 i live downtown which is really important to my clients because im living that lifestyle
608485 at first i was buying into what people were saying that you couldnt live downtown that i wouldnt be safe that id get mugged that i wouldnt find a place to park my car
608486 but theres really nowhere i wanted to be but detroit
608487 gozo has a completely different and unique identity but word about its special character is simply not out yet
608488 kempinski is europes oldest luxury hotel group which practically guarantees the quality of services and facilities but the destination itself is of at least equal importance and there is still a lot of work to be done in order to put gozo on the map for discerning travellers and event organisers

608511 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
608512 its certainly a black eye for the industry but unfortunately altercations on the field are part of the game
608513 it certainly wont deter me from continuing to go to minor league baseball games
608514 i think its just good baseball at its purest form
608515 it really helped me that it started raining because i was able to go in the locker room and talk to my coach
608516 it wasnt easy to talk to my coach because he was really mad

608518 id always phone his room saying i was someone else from the front desk and there was a limo waiting in the front and hed go limousine because he could get riled up
608519 in every city it would be a different voice i loved his laugh i loved laughing with him he was just that type of guy he was a guys guy we had a lot of fun together
608520 leif couldve been one of these guys who constantly told you about his playing days or bragged about what he did
608521 if you looked at it leif pettersen was a terrific receiver in the league on wednesday night i saw tony gabriel out here and was remembering the catch people forget that was one of leifs greatest games and the commissioner gave him the game ball that day i knew leif a lot of years and he never told anybody that thats the kind of guy he was im really going to miss him
608522 leif was one of the most competitive people i have ever met
608523 he loved to win whether it be in golf or football
608524 the only thing he loved more than winning was his family i will really miss him
608525 leif was widely respected by his peers fans and the entire cfl community for his passion and commitment to the game he had the innate ability to make those around him feel welcome and appreciated all with a wonderful sense of humour
608526 he had his life in perspective thats the best thing i can say about him
608527 we all have an ego some ex players have a huge ego and their exploits grow but i think leifs didnt
608528 he understood who he was and why he played and was very thankful for the fact that he was able to stay in the league
608529 as a player and television commentator leif was an obvious talent a true professional
608530 but it was his quick smile and seemingly effortless style that added an undeniable touch of class to everything he did and in the process to our league our thoughts are with his loved ones
608531 i am deeply saddened by the passing of my teammate and friend leif pettersen i have memories of a young fun guy who was always a positive force on the team but more importantly great recent memories of a good friend who was continually kind and gracious in his support and happiness for the success of the riders it will not be the same going to toronto and leif isnt there to welcome us
608532 always an optimist he had an infectious attitude and demeanour and no one ever left a meeting or social occasion with him with anything but a smile and a positive outlook
608533 he was truly one of the good guys in the sports business
608534 leif has been a great friend to the ticats organization and on behalf of everybody within our organization i would like to extend our sympathies to all of the pettersen family
608535 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week
608536 a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference
608537 i didnt really address it until i missed it big on 11 and 13 because i had been playing so well and i felt like it was only a couple of yards off the fairway most of the time
608538 he has helped on the distance and i think 50 per cent of what i have done is because of the caddie
608539 i dont think i have enough power to play on the lpga like physical condition
608540 im happy for what he did and hes a great player and he seems like the greg norman of old
608541 but ive got to go out there tomorrow and play golf and i dont think greg norman is going to help me around so i have to do it on my own
608542 of course i would love to be closer if not in the lead
608543 but this is my position there is nothing i can do about it i have nothing to lose i hope to get a good start tomorrow and we will see
608544 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
608545 it isnt like we havent been here in two or three years we were just here six weeks ago so everybody kind of knows what to expect as far as the track goes
608546 when it clouds up it gains a lot of grip and a lot of speed when the sun breaks out it gets slick and greasy that has a lot to do with the outcome of the race and hopefully it will be just fine
608547 hes still playing great it happens in every sport when someone sets the bar so high guys find a way of creeping up behind you
608548 i dont think theres a huge difference between a semifinal and a final but to win it would be huge
608549 im going to have to play against one of the best players in the world to win it i feel like im playing well enough to do it
608550 using localization in the masterpage and other pages vb sample part 2
608551 the farthest i have been is ontario its going to be a whole new experience for me
608552 this is huge im pretty excited about going to nationals but my first goal is to make the cut everything else after that would be great as well
608553 but winning those titles has given me the confidence in my game and the confidence that i can shoot under par that i can go low
608554 we had some pretty low scores at provincials so i think our team has the potential for some low scores at nationals
608555 i think well surprise a lot of people out there well be turning some heads
608556 we want to go there and start a new story for nova scotia junior golf
608557 in years to come we want to keep building up and keep getting better and better as we go
608558 for me and alistair were both 15 im pretty proud of the fact that two 15 year olds are on the team
608559 i just want to be able to keep us in games
608560 i dont want him to throw 125 pitches every time out
608561 when he came to take me out i wasnt surprised
608562 i dont know how to swing easy all i try to do is keep my head on the ball but thats the same with everybody
608563 she accepts the fact that the testing was properly done and the results properly reported
608564 today we have absolutely no concerns about the organization no regrets come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
608565 im not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for
608566 we are not running the internet in china chinese authorities are running the internet in china
608567 if we allow political propaganda its the end of the harmony of the olympic village and the end of the harmony of the games

608589 in our native english saxon language we find many words expressed by one sillable those consisting of more are borrowed from other nations
608590 a word which has been used from time to time with many shades of meaning
608591 he had an acute vernacular gift and a narrative frankness shocking in his day he cut a wide swath through a manhattan demimonde whose fierce friendships and bitter feuds fueled by oceans of booze were played out at such institutions as the stork club
608592 the purity league was an ironic reference to their shared interest in girls and alcohol
608593 a bunch of people who hate each other and eat dinner together

608601 we understand as the dalai lama does that tibet is part of china but we hope tibetans are not repressed or oppressed
608602 you dont want to go over there and insult the chinese
608603 it would not be good for our relations i certainly dont think the president would or should go over there and be confrontational at the same time i think the president can in a very diplomatic style make it clear what we stand for and believe in
608604 i see a steady progression in russia of more and more repression of rights and the disappearance of semblances of democracy
608605 we have to deal with them negotiate with them especially in light of their hoard of petrodollars but we cant sit by and watch a country murder people in england

608621 cell phones give off radiation any time theyre turned on so that they can communicate with base stations
608622 the radiation emitted however is stronger and more frequent when youre talking or messaging
608623 yes since childrens nervous systems are still developing and they have thinner scalps and skulls than adults they should use cell phones only in emergencies

608639 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
608640 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
608641 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
608642 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
608643 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
608644 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
608645 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
608646 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
608647 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

608650 it is a pity for paul hamm that he cant compete here
608651 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
608652 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
608653 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
608654 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
608655 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
608656 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
608657 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
608658 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
608659 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
608660 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
608661 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
608662 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
608663 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
608664 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
608665 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
608666 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
608667 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
608668 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
608669 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
608670 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

608679 they underwent unsafe operations for taking out their kidneys outside jordan and after returning home they were forced to consult local kidney specialists after suffering complications
608680 their confessions helped the authorities to arrest brokers who were involved in the kidney selling deals
608681 i dont think that prices will return to the record level nor will they fall below 100 per barrel
608682 what some media reported that kuwaits oil reserves are less than that is wrong and not based on scientific record on the contrary there are new discoveries
608683 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
608684 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
608685 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
608686 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
608687 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
608688 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
608689 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
608690 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
608691 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
608692 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
608693 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
608694 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
608695 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
608696 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
608697 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
608698 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
608699 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
608700 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
608701 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
608702 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
608703 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
608704 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
608705 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
608706 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
608707 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
608708 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
608709 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
608710 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
608711 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation

608713 sesungguhnya shodaqah zakat zakat hanyalan untuk orang orang fakir orang orang miskin pengurus pengurus zakat para mualaf yang dibujuk hatinya untuk memerdekakan budak orang orang yang berhutang untuk jalan allah dan orang orang yang sedang dalam perjalanan sebagai sesuatu ketetapan yang di wajibkanallah dan allah maha mengetahui lagi maha bijaksana kita sadari bahwa tingkat kebutuhan hidup kian hari dirasakan kian tinggi terlebih bagi keluarga yang perolehan penghasilannya tidak menentu seperti pekerja buruh harian kuli bangunan kuli cuci pakaian tetangga penjaja dagangan keliling dll mereka tak berdaya dalam mengahadapi segala macam beban hidup ini sehingga tidak sedikit anak remaja usia sekolah dari keluarga kurang mampu tersebut yang terbengkalai pendidikannya karena ketidak mampuan membiayainya terlebih anak remaja usia sekolah yang sudah tidak lagi memiliki orangtua yatim semakin lengkaplah beban perjalanan hidup yang di laluinya
608714 ambilah zakat dari sebagian harta mereka yang dengan itu kamu membersihkan dan mensucikan mereka dan mendoalah untuk mereka sesungguhnya doa kamu itu menjadi ketentraman jiwa bagi mereka
608715 perumpamaan nafkah yang dikeluarkan oleh orang orang yang menafkahkan hartanya di jalan allah adalah serupa dengan sebutir benih yang menumbuhkan tujuh tangkai pada setiap tangkai terdapat seratus buah allah melipatgandakan pahalanya kepada siapa yang disukai nya dan allah maha luas pemberiannya lagi maha mengetahui atas perhatian dan sambutan baik bapak ibu tiada ungkapan yang paling indah selain alhamdulillah semoga dijadikan amal ibadah oleh allah swt

608717 they knocked on the door several times and there was no reply
608718 they used a master key to unlock the door and they then observed the accused wearing only a white t shirt naked from the waist down
608719 the accused was holding the bike and moving his hips back and forth as if to simulate sex

608776 el gran desaf o de industria el campo y el sector financiero es profundizar el modelo para que agregando valor siga dando trabajo mejorando salarios e incorporando innovaci n y tecnolog a
608777 el secretario de comercio interior no define el rol de un gobierno y considero que esa apreciaci n es reduccionista demasiado period stica la conjetura de que tal o cual persona sea la causante de tal o cual problema y la que decide su continuidad o no es la presidenta pero si alguien defiende es porque el otro fue atacado no creo que moreno haya sido atacado as que no tengo por qu defenderlo
608778 volver a a impulsar la resoluci n 125 de retenciones m viles ya que por primera vez en la argentina las instituciones de la democracia nos pusimos a discutir en serio con posibilidad de ser sancionada una ley que por primera vez tocaba la redistribuci n del ingreso en la argentina
608779 el tema del indec fue manejado pol tica y medi ticamente y en los pa ses vecinos donde los salarios son menores a los de la argentina se registran precios de alimentos mayores y la inflaci n sin embargo da menos que en nuestro pa s
608780 con el debate de las retenciones m viles en el congreso tuvimos la oportunidad por primera vez de discutir c mo redistribuir rentas excepcionales y fue un salto de calidad institucional comparable con la discusi n realizada en la gesti n del ex presidente n stor kirchner sobre la derogaci n de las leyes de obediencia debida y punto final
608781 comparto con el presidente de brasil lula da silva la convicci n de que la integraci n es una necesidad absoluta entre ambos pa ses y la llegada del mandatario con una delegaci n de 300 empresarios revela la importancia de la argentina como lugar de inversiones porque es altamente competitiva
608782 muchas veces hemos tratado en estos ltimos a os temas de redistribuci n con la plata del estado con la plata del estado todos son socialistas el tema es ser redistributivo con la renta extra y el problema es el modelo de la concentraci n de la riqueza en un mundo complicado cada vez mas y donde alimentos y energ a requiere de las autoridades y exigen instrumentos para afrontar esa realidad
608783 se estaban discutiendo los t rmino de intercambio y los grados de arancelamiento de importaci n y exportaci n de los pa ses emergentes y los productos industriales fue una discusi n de intereses y hay que ser pragm ticos para no te irlos de ideolog a y lo que ponen los pa ses desarrollados con mayor capital acumulado respecto a nosotros no son a buen negocio para los pa ses emergentes
608784 hay una participaci n plena en el sistema de contralor del gobierno y hemos avanzado mucho porque hay una participaci n plena en el sistema de contralor del gobierno con la aplicaci n de la constituci n nacional la auditoria general la sigen la comisi n revisora de cuentas el parlamento y ustedes los periodistas
608785 no hay un tipo de cambio presidencial sino que estamos ante un r gimen de administraci n por parte del banco central con autonom a que ha permitido acumulaci n de reservas y solidez al sistema financiero
608786 es un tema superado con la modificaci n de la legislaci n y adem s nunca he firmado un decreto de necesidad y urgencia a pesar de que son instrumentos avalados desde 1994 por la constituci n nacional
608787 en 2003 dec an que el pusil mine era el ex presidente n stor kirchner y que la que daba las rdenes era yo pero el ex presidente y yo somos dos militantes pol ticos y tal vez resulte dif cil de comprender para la generaci n del posmodernismo pero no para los que nos formamos en un mundo en donde el compromiso pol tico era una actitud de vida
608788 el club de par s nos quiso someter a un plan del fondo monetario internacional y la deuda la vamos a abordar oportunamente con serenidad pero en cualquier proceso de renegociaci n es necesario el crecimiento para hacer posible esos compromisos
608789 fue una controversia no por conciencia sino por intereses de sectores chicos pero muy poderosos en t rminos econ micos y lo que se ve finalmente es c mo se puede ser funcional a intereses que uno quiere defender y termina actuando en contra de los propios y sectores que se dicen progresistas votaron intereses diferentes
608790 no me corresponde adjetivar la decisi n del vicepresidente y hay que desdramatizarla porque adem s los roles de la presidenta y el vicepresidente est n perfectamente delimitados por la constituci n y yo tengo mucho respeto por las instituciones
608791 nunca se vio desde el retorno la democracia un nivel de violencia de lock out patronal con cortes de rutas y la afectaci n de otras actividades econ micas y la violencia no fue por parte del gobierno sino por sectores que provocaron la suspensi n entera de turnos de fabrica la suba de precios por falta de mercader a y hasta escenas de pugilato
608792 la lecci n que pude sacar es que fui demasiado ingenua porque no contaba con el poder de sectores que si bien son peque os en n mero son muy fuertes en poder econ mico y creo que deber a haber en todos los sectores de la vida pol tica un gesto de calidad institucional no s lo en el gobierno los sectores que defienden sus propios intereses deber an decirlo a la hora de pedir el voto a la sociedad
608793 la corte suprema deber a dar directrices de comportamiento para los jueces ya que se habla de c digos blandos y duros de modificaciones de las leyes pero los jueces tienen facultades para negar excarcelaciones teniendo en cuenta la peligrosidad del delincuente
608794 la construcci n del tren bala no significa un s lo peso de erogaci n por parte del estado nacional sino que se realizar con un pr stamo financiado por bancos franceses
608795 en el mundo nos admiran por los juicios y castigos contra responsables de cr menes de lesa humanidad aunque prefirir a que nos admirasen por otros temas y con los juicios estamos cumpliendo con una deuda con un modo de ver y de vivir que nos debe universalizar a partir de la condici n humana y no tenemos una mirada reduccionista en la defensa de los derechos humanos sea quien sea quien los cometa porque excede las ideolog as
608796 la relaci n con estados unidos es normal y seria como debe ser con todos los pa ses del mundo y que un afroamericano como el senador barack obama sea candidato por uno de los partidos mayoritarios demuestra por parte del pueblo norteamericano una vitalidad sorprendente y admirable y una cabeza muy abierta
608797 cuando se dec a del hallazgo de una valija con 800 000 d lares para financiar mi campa a electoral respond a los emisarios de estados unidos sobre lo que cre a porque recuerdo los titulares que hablaban de 800 000 d lares para la campa a de la presidenta y respond a los estados unidos
608798 nunca hubo desde 2003 a la fecha un pronunciado crecimiento de la coparticipaci n federal a las provincias como ahora y ello se debi a que el modelo de crecimiento econ mico hizo crecer la recaudaci n y motiv que las provincias tuviesen mucho m s fondos
608799 tenemos encuestas diferentes a la consultora poliarqu a diferentes a las publicadas hoy por el diario la naci n que tiene una l nea editorial muy cr tica a esta gesti n y a la anterior aunque no quiero polemizar sobre esta cuesti n
608800 no advertimos que nuestros progresos econ micos obedecen a modelos econ micos adem s de la capacidad individual
608801 la prohibici n del acceso de p blico y prensa a las audiencias de debate en protecci n de la moral e intimidad de los testigos y el inter s de la justicia

608807 la moral e intimidad de los testigos y el inter s de la justicia
608808 una medida de censura anticipada y de cercenamiento total a la libertad de expresi n y a la actividad period stica como comunicadora de hechos sociales
608809 desnaturaliza la esencia de un juicio oral y p blico cuya publicidad y transparencia con los resguardos que propondremos constituir precisamente un fuerte resguardo para el aseguramiento de las garant as de las v ctimas suficientemente vapuleadas a lo largo de todo este proceso
608810 no s lo resulta prematura en tanto la misma puede adem s ejercerse en caso de necesidad en cualquier momento en uso de las facultades del art culo 342 del ritual por parte del tribunal sino que aparece en tales condiciones m s dirigida a proteger al imputado que a las v ctimas ignorando que es de inter s de toda la sociedad el esclarecimiento del presente caso y que existe normativa constitucional que ampara tal inter s
608811 no debe inferirse que esta representaci n propicie la vulneraci n de la intimidad y el derecho a la privacidad de las v ctimas
608812 ha sido esta representaci n la nica y exclusiva interesada en su protecci n
608813 se contin a revictimizando a las v ctimas incluso en esta etapa en la que a n e inexplicablemente se pretende forzar una nueva pericia psicol gica psiqui trica de una de las v ctimas y particular damnificado luis guti rrez contradiciendo todos los protocolos de intervenci n en la materia
608814 el debate deber ser oral y p blico bajo sanci n de nulidad
608815 en caso de duda debe estarse siempre por la publicidad del debate
608816 la prensa no puede ser excluida de la sala de audiencias lo cual muestra elocuentemente que la disposici n en contrario con el alcance pretendido en la resoluci n en crisis resulta prematura infundada contraria a la esencia del juicio oral y p blico y debe por ende revocarse en la forma solicitada
608817 se disponga la realizaci n del juicio oral y p blico con autorizaci n previa rigurosa acreditaci n de periodistas debidamente identificados y el acceso al p blico hasta un m ximo de diez personas por jornada de debate con igual criterio de identificaci n y autorizaci n previas

608844 there is nothing more dramatic then playing golf while observing spectacular views
608845 until now my signature courses with spectacular views have involved water this new project will allow golfers panoramic views that extend for over 30 miles of countryside in all directions i have spent the past five decades designing golf courses all over the world including courses on great coastal sites this new project however brings great excitement to wife alice and me because the course is on arguably the best inland site i have ever worked on
608846 there are lots of areas where you can bring your kids
608847 if you avoid expensive neighborhoods like this one youll do alright but the key is to plan ahead
608848 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

608854 esa reclamaci n no le servir a karadzic como hilo conductor de su propia defensa lo del supuesto trato con el antiguo mediador estadounidense en bosnia richard holbrooke es muy llamativo y medi tico pero nada m s lo que ha ocurrido es m s simple los acuerdos pol ticos han salido al encuentro de la justicia internacional porque la necesidad de no dejar impunes cr menes horrorosos ha calado por fin entre los estados y la opini n p blica de ah que los tribunales listos para afrontar este reto hayan reaccionado prestos
608855 le el acta de acusaci n contra charles taylor en junio de 2003 pero no acab en manos de la justicia hasta 2006 a el bashir presidente de sudan le ocurrir lo mismo la voluntad de entregarlo existe es el principio del principio de su final y lo que se busca es una f rmula diplom tica aceptable para trasladarlo a la corte penal internacional cpi lo saben la liga rabe y la uni n africana aunque hoy critiquen su entrega es m s creo que dentro de 5 a os estar en manos de los jueces y habr paz en sud n
608856 por eso hay que ser muy cuidadosos con acusaciones como la de genocidio
608857 hay estudios sobre el particular que describen la calma de algunos d as y la ira y los gritos de otros en el banquillo de los acusados ha sucedido desde el nazi goebbels al ejecutado presidente iraqu sadam hussein o bien al ex presidente serbio milosevic todos pasaron de un poder absoluto a ser anulados y no conciben lo que les ocurre
608858 los estados no deben olvidar que es un lugar de referencia y a la vez un foro complementario al juzgar s lo a los principales causantes de tragedias internacionales no sustituye a los poderes judiciales de los distintos estados
608859 por eso lo ideal para la comunidad internacional es que la cadena de culpables comparezca en lo posible ante jueces locales
608860 tanto siria como elementos pro sirios de los servicios secretos libaneses tuvieron que ver en el atentado
608861 ning n estado actual tiene bastante poder para garantizar la vida y libertad de sus ciudadanos si la propia comunidad internacional no respeta el imperio de la ley

608867 understably there was a euphoric atmosphere at the end but we dont want to see that euphoria turn into sadness
608868 there may be people who look at the final fixtures and start making predictions suggesting that it wont be as hard as it should be for us because portsmouth are in the fa cup final the following week
608869 but i dont buy into that at all there might be some leagues around the world where you see certain things happen in final games of the season but not the premier league
608870 whoever portsmouth put in their side it will be a difficult game for us but the good thing is that we have put ourselves in a situation where now have it our hands
608871 on that front there is a sense of relief and satisfaction that in difficult circumstances the players stood up and were counted
608872 its not in our hands but it goes to the wire
608873 i believe in these players to give all theyve got
608874 wigan are safe now but with a great manager like steve bruce they are going to go for it
608875 if we pick up three points at home to bolton we have a very good chance
608876 it was a bit slow at times and we got a bit of a rollicking at half time
608877 all we can do is our job and i thought we did a professional job
608878 in different circumstances it would have been nice to watch the first 20 minutes
608879 at half time i told them the effort was incredible it was like they were trying to plait spaghetti they worked so hard to stay in the game we just needed to restructure
608880 now its s or bust and we have to get a result next week to give ourselves a chance its down to us to deliver
608881 the manager always gets the blame if things go wrong and my shoulders are broad enough so i will take anything thats going
608882 since the chairman has come here hes built a self financing club that ultimately might be our downfall
608883 i took a calculated risk not to spend much in the summer and january if it doesnt work out then its my fault
608884 its their last game in the premier league and they will want to put on a show
608885 robbie was magnificent we rely on him a lot and today he got the goal and played in a position that made reading uncomfortable
608886 we played a good game there were a lot of chances and we dominated play we should have finished the game off
608887 fergie hasnt been on the phone to me yet give him a chance but he wont be expecting any favours from us and he wont get any it will be a game for us to look forward to
608888 the quality of the premier league is down to its honesty and integrity thats what makes it the best league in the world
608889 now we just want to concentrate on what we have just achieved
608890 driving home from bolton on december 16 we had nine points from 16 games and i was thinking we are in trouble
608891 it has been a fantastic achievement to get 31 points since christmas
608892 i am delighted for mr whelan who forked out an unbelievable sum of money to turn the club around and he deserves a team in the premier league
608893 i am sure that the liverpool bid for barry didnt help
608894 but if you put that down as the reason for our display you would be looking for an excuse
608895 we should be better than that it was our opportunity to put some pressure on everton in the race for fifth place and we didnt take it
608896 there is no way i am going to force him out of the door
608897 ill sit down and discuss it with him he is a quality centre half and he can play at this level
608898 it has been difficult for me because i played with chris and maybe i have to look at whether i dealt with it properly he was frustrated and i let him go on loan
608899 full credit to him he was disappointed to come back and miss stokes massive game but he performed very well
608900 we played 4 4 2 but it doesnt suit us we are much better with 4 5 1 thats why weve won so many away
608901 i did it because we need to get games into people like baros but it doesnt seem to work for us
608902 its been a difficult week but we will get them on the training ground and freshen them up
608903 i wont play a weak team against fulham next week i wouldnt do that to anyone
608904 it is the same old story and its what relegated teams do we played well for 45 minutes and then the goals we conceded were unbelievable
608905 our fans were incredible and the sooner we give them a team to be proud of the better this wasnt about beating that sunderland record
608906 it would have been nice to get six points from the last three games but given the form weve been showing it was never likely
608907 we are where we are because we are just not good enough
608908 can we take any positives into next season probably only the people in the stands

608983 well have you decided if you are going to recycle him or put him up for refinement
608984 i thought you were just here to watch kevin to get your kicks
608985 i am im enjoying i do always love watching you work harold im just curious which way you are going to go thats all so many things to consider so many future implications
608986 youre going to go see her arent you on this day in this time
608987 its okay youve earned a night of indulgence and besides whats the team motto what is meant to be will be right
608988 cmon we got two births to celebrate tonight one in here and the other over at st vincents smoke up its good to be king no
608989 i wonder how long you two would just stand there in silence waiting on me
608990 anyway ok what brings us together this fine sunday evening
608991 darling that was rhetorical this isnt your first rodeo does harold really make you raise your hand and be all please sir may i have another cmon chop chop i need you guys to speak up ok so we are here to discuss the field trip to boston no
608992 boston yes im assuming well have a standard three car caravan with the mayhem secure in the second ive assigned two ameleries to a car plus three warrior level boradeens you can see here
608993 ive mapped out the route well take the merritt i want to avoid 95 as much as possible its nothing but traffic
608994 uh huh good idea hate the 95 and you both are good with this
608995 i briefed him he said that you would be the best source have i missed something do you think we need more cars or do you think i have too many i was afraid wed have a flat or something so i wanted spare transportation
608996 its not allowed there has to be a fair chance that you
608997 wont make it that you know youll be killed or something harold didnt give you the bullet points huh
608998 kevin was trying to lead them to their own conclusion these were fundamentals
608999 thats it exactly its just how things are there has to be a balance and in that balance good and well not so good there has to be the possibility that things arent going to go the way you want them its just how the game is played kids and this
609000 chance for what that i wont make it what that well hit a guard rail in connecticut that the car will just explode why not just fold me up and pop me to boston in the first place
609001 have you ever seen cannonball run thats what this is kinda like but with less dom delouis and moustaches no staches at all im adamant about that basically we cant fold you we cant make it happen we have to keep the option open that the other side can win its a four hour race to get you to a supply room in the basement of ned devines
609002 let me see if ive got this straight ive lived the last thirty years in the filth that is humanity ive studied them mastered their pain all the while waiting for six other mayhems to get their shit together so we can meet up and have a mergence now i was okay with not taking a plane and driving up there its scenic but whats with this plot device shit
609003 you are entertaining surprisingly so i like you both i like you very much
609004 i want you to know i recognize your frustration and
609005 so we all love god we are his servants happy happy we are all part of his plan and in his plan the rain gives and the rain takes in his plan we have our paths you dear jake are a mayhem a creature of destruction and sadness congratulations you are your name this is your function you live to cause well mayhem and hopefully survive long enough to hook up with six of your siblings so that you can take your mission globally its how we get our genocide on how we move up from evening news lead to cnn special report were all good with this no okay then while we three sit here and plan out the family vacation dont you think there is someone on the other side trying to stop us that maybe doesnt want you to go all merge y dont you think some group would see that as a bad thing a very very bad and evil thing
609006 but were acting on behalf of god you are a metranere sir is a metranere
609007 does he really make you call him sir such a sick fuck anywho
609008 you see kids there are schisms in even the best of families there are those who believe we are doing gods work we are fulfilling his plan we often say that what is meant to be will be those of that particular dogma see the chaos of the universe as controlled randomness god created us all he is our beginning and he is our end if the end is known if the end is set by him then what happens in the middle doesnt really matter now does it its fate that right turn at albuquerque was meant to be and in this we are all cogs doing our nine to five to keep it going
609009 then there are those who believe god has moved on and we are maintaining an aged worn machine that was never designed to last this long and in that maintenance we can determine our own end but these things are nothing new the first test of a sentient being is self awareness the second is to ask why am i here philosophy is the oldest racket going
609010 no no old friend you do it much better than me youre more solemn more dignified my tellings are always heavy with the sarcasm and useless referencing i wander
609011 i think youve said most of it anyway but okay fine
609012 what is it were doing oh yes i feel it now plot device
609013 ah yes i did like that jakes a clever boy
609014 and if we know youre ready and that the other six are ready then you can bet the others know as well and that theyll come after you after all of you
609015 then why dont we just get it done and over
609016 so it really is a game bishop rook and knight and you guys sit on the side refereeing making sure no one steps out of bounds right the last thirty years ive spent in the shit that is the world means nothing more than being called up to play in the big show thats what im starting to get here and you call it fair
609017 but still sir he only has to make it boston and meet with the others
609018 were assigning a psychic as well youll need her to navigate
609019 dude seriously this is fucked up dont make me okay why dont you do your super powerful being shit and find out yourself
609020 and having her brother psychically spy on her is less of a violation
609021 lets be honest here its not like it would be the first time
609022 uh mother fuck you dude i was fourteen and my hot
609023 that was just the first time we both know there were many more incidences and besides really all i need is for her to finish your presence will just speed things along
609024 yes yes fine well work something out something accommodating to you in the meantime i need her clean and presentable in the next hour
609025 i think you are supposed to pinch yourself to check to see if you are dreaming there buddy boy
609026 nuh uh i havent been in your room i never go in your room
609027 when youre done with the books return them to me
609028 dont tell your mom or my dad that you took them they dont want you reading that stuff they dont want you knowing those things just yet and obviously never enter my room again without knocking in any capacity i trust we understand each other

609037 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them
609038 our liaison officer at the base camp confirmed death of five
609039 gerald he inspires me to keep at it when i first came to the forum i was a wreck artistically afraid to show anything and convinced i paint all wrong
609040 one big cover up cos everyone knows everyone to them that kind of thing rape and so on doesnt happen in jersey well it does
609041 its difficult for people outside sometimes to understand in a small place you are particularly aware of the need to behave properly
609042 to behave appropriately to have the integrity to take decisions that need to be taken its no good trying to drawn up a code of practice for everything because the circumstances are too wide
609043 but one does have to be aware of these positions and as far as im concerned personally it is sometimes the case that i have had to consider the prosecution of politicians of ministers and ive done that
609044 and as attorney general i have an independent appointment which certainly gives me the comfort of knowing i can take those decisions fearlessly and to the extent that they come to be taken in this case i intend to do that
609045 the truth of the matter is that weve delivering justice on this island for centuries and i dont see that this is going to make any difference to it
609046 i know on behalf of the careleavers they would like lenny to stay on but as far we we know he hasnt even been asked if hed like to stay on
609047 when he goes we think it will all be swept under the carpet basically
609048 what has made this one significantly different from my perception and from any similar enquiries of this nature that ive been involved in before is the political hostility that it has engendered from amongst politicians who one would normally think would be crawling over themselves to offer support to the inquiry and the victims
609049 and with a very few notable exceptions that hasnt happened here
609050 on the contrary the only interventions most of them seem to have made is to criticise the investigation to make comments about us being out of control because were acting as if we think were a politically independent organisation which always struck me as the very backbone of proper policing
609051 high value jobs and a workforce that can handle the demands of those types of jobs
609052 this all has a political background aside from the real estate profiting the pay offs to political campaigns
609053 le silence retombait autour de nous comme une pluie de paillettes sur une tartine de colle
609054 because she played a similar part in walk the line
609055 my experiences post flight were ones of not being very productive for quite awhile depression and alcoholism things like that
609056 i was trying to recover from that and ran into lois afterwards
609057 i would like to have wishful thinking and say yes only time will tell
609058 maintain a friendship and who knows what will happen when we get older
609059 for the next three years were both extremely busy people so its tough
609060 everything is going good but its still a lot of work
609061 gillian and i are not as close as mulder and scully but who could be nobody is as close as mulder and scully but we worked together for so long that by the time the series ended we had enough of each other
609062 but six years having passed its like i dont make jam but im assuming you pour away the boiling liquid so after six years the liquid is all boiled off and all that remains is the jam of appreciation
609063 you know what byron said about english women he said that they were like frozen champagne when champagne freezes all the non alcoholic liquids freeze to the top and at the bottom is just that strong distilled alcohol i think it is a compliment
609064 im building a hotel there it is environmentally friendly i went there with the make a wish foundation and met some great people the royal family were really friendly
609065 its going to be built with no fossil fuel at all in abu dhabi where they have all that oil
609066 its been a fair while since that one a lineout so poor so all you can do there is learn from your mistakes and next time you go forward into a match make sure that youve got those things that placed pressure on us sorted out and move forward from here
609067 i just think generally inaccuracy from everyone right across the board was the problem
609068 our lifting our throwing and our jumping a combination of that just puts pressure on ourselves so it was disappointing
609069 the lineouts been going very well up until tonight and when you have a night like that it seems like nothing falls into place
609070 and couple with that it was one of those games where it felt like everything the all blacks did turned to gold
609071 at a time when serial bomb blasts are occurring all over the country more policemen should be out patrolling the streets of mumbai which has been targeted several times by terrorists
609072 what is worse these policemen do not merely sit at our bars
609073 a table is kept reserved for these officials moreover our customers get scared with the policemen staring at them we are made to feel as if we are doing something grossly illegal by running bars though we have all the necessary licences
609074 i am personally against this stupid practice of making policemen sit in bars
609075 an inspector and his team raided my bar at 9 pm and rounded up the girls even though they could work for half an hour more
609076 who have extorted several lakhs of rupees in the past few months from bar owners by threatening to file cases against them
609077 the money is collected through four small bar owners we are required to deposit the amount with one of them and then our bars will be spared a bar owner said
609078 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
609079 and when he did throw strikes they werent in the right location
609080 really really good even when they were hitting me around thats the best ive thrown the baseball in a month and a half and to have that outcome is pretty frustrating
609081 the only thing i thought about was that when there were runners on second base they were giving locations maybe they had an idea what i was doing guys were leaning at pitches away but even without runners at second it felt like they knew where theyd be
609082 what ive got to do the only thing i could have done more was back them off the plate
609083 i really felt i should have got under their chins a little bit show them its my plate and i didnt do that
609084 he blends in with the lineup when you have so many well known hitters in there and then he seems to pop up down the lineup and get some big hits
609085 there are another three four or five villages out past this point and there is only one road
609086 if there was a problem police wouldnt think twice about closing it and wed be stuck
609087 weve got thousands of officers coming in and they dont know me from adam
609088 theyre going to be interested in everybody because it doesnt matter whether you look like a protester what car you drive what bike you ride how you walk
609089 if youre in the area as far as theyre concerned youre something to do with it
609090 i dont want to be stopped and searched regularly for something ive nothing to do with
609091 we know how vital the a228 is to people on the peninsula
609092 police do not intend to close it and will act quickly to deal with any attempt to block it
609093 the five complaint boxes will be opened once in 15 days in the presence of chief judge d krishnaraja and all initiatives will be taken by the prison department to redress the genuine grievances of the inmates
609094 the new complex is a great relief for the department and also the jail inmates it can accommodate about 500 prisoners
609095 we plan to install separate pcos for remand convict and women prisoners enabling them to make a call for five minutes every week in the presence of a police officer and all the dialled numbers will be recorded
609096 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
609097 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
609098 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
609099 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
609100 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
609101 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
609102 i said if youre worried about my confidence please dont be
609103 ive felt like ive thrown pretty well recently i told him ill do whatever they want me to do but id want to make sure i get some save situations
609104 anyone down there can be used anywhere im not going to make a blanket statement and say youre not my closer street could still close games if you have a closer whos struggling a little bit and lately a couple of guys who are hot you can switch it around a little bit

609106 im young im new to the national scene obama said
609107 my name is barack obama i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate what that means is i am unfamiliar and people are still trying to get a fix on who i am
609108 the one thing we know about the team that john mccain has assembled because its a carry over from some of the folks who have worked on the bush campaigns obama said at a press conference at cape canaveral fla
609109 they are very good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing if you think about this week what they have been good at is distracting jobs are being lost and what was being talked about was paris and britney
609110 we get four or five shots in a row assertions by mccain that i would rather lose a war so that i can win a campaign that i am not willing to visit the troops that i somehow am full of myself that im an empty headed celebrity whatever repeated attacks have been launched this week
609111 ultimately what i think weve got to do is keep driving home the essential message of this campaign that weve got to change business as usual what weve seen this week ahs been politics as usual
609112 let me be clear in no way do i think john mccains campaign was being racist obama said
609113 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
609114 obama is against offshore drilling and wants us to have high gas prices
609115 in arizona a bill to recognize a holiday honoring mlk failed in the legislature so then gov bruce babbitt a democrat declared one through executive order in january 1987 the first act of arizonas new governor republican evan mecham was to rescind the executive order by his predecessor to create an mlk holiday arizonas stance became a national controversy mccain backed the decision at the time
609116 in a vote likely to haunt him for the rest of his public career mccain voted against 1983 legislation establishing the third monday in january as the federal holiday marking kings birthday back home in arizona he supported gov evan mechams decision in 1987 to rescind an executive order creating a state holiday for king but later reversed his position

609156 investigators determined that clark rockefeller and reigh were staying in an apartment in close proximity to a facility known as the anchorage marina where clark was docking his 26ft unnamed catamaran
609157 investigators used this information to create a ruse to lure clark from to apartment to the marina by placing a call to him and telling him his boat was taking on water
609158 when clark left the apartment he was immediately placed under arrest by fbi agents reigh was located alone in the apartment
609159 officers reported that little reigh said she was very happy to see very nice people
609160 fit into it no i cant i could maybe squeeze into it
609161 they travel with me to certain engagements i always like to end clinics by letting the kids hold it and have their pictures taken with it
609162 the gold medal the parents are fighting with the kids over getting a photo its just exciting to see peoples reaction to seeing an olympic medal
609163 i still get stopped by a number of fans and they thank me for the memories they thank me for the good times
609164 i dont think those little kids who are waving and are excited were even born in 2000 when i was in my last olympics
609165 they dont know dominique dawes theyve heard their parents talk about what ive done and my achievements and the dreams i had become reality i think theyre excited to see me in a sport in which they now participate
609166 kerri strugs vault just made that experience so much more memorable so many women and womens teams had already won and made history and then ours stood out because of the triumphant end and kerri strugs vault
609167 youve got to be thankful that moment happened because thats what made it stand out from the other gold medals
609168 thats something hard to do but these girls are capable of doing it
609169 its like someone getting into the sport of gymnastics for like a month and going im a gymnast no youre not you have to go through the bumps and bruises and learn a little bit more and become a little bit more accomplished at it
609170 its been a long time since ive been in baltimore i jumped here once cant remember where exactly
609171 you werent even born when i was jumping were you
609172 i definitely get a special feeling but its not just every four years
609173 we were talking about personal goals and each of them exhibited to me that aggressiveness wanting to win
609174 im not talking nba they want gold and that takes teamwork theres no price tag on that i told them you cant buy that each of you has tremendous individual gifts but when you put a team together it has to come without ego
609175 when i took off on the board something was strange
609176 i was up there a half hour went by then an hour went by
609177 not really it was all pretty fast i landed and it was just a surprise to everybody else but also to me
609178 records are made to be broken i watch every four years to see whats happening its been 40 years now hope it stands but if not ive sure enjoyed it
609179 you guys in the media are always talking about seven gold medals i dont ever talk about that im just a very competitive person in everything i do and im doing what i love
609180 im not one of those swimmers who doesnt want to see other swimmers results im on all those swimming web sites checking out how my competitors are doing i know theyll be at their best in beijing and i want to be at my best
609181 i take this as michaels job the pool deck is his office
609182 once the competition starts he doesnt need me only michael can swim the race
609183 ultimately youve got to have the parent in some level of cooperation or its never going to work its critical to this process
609184 parents have to consider whats best for the child the coachs job is to develop a champion
609185 parents shouldnt try to be the experts kids want to be the experts in the sport theyre spending all their time and energy physically and emotionally to get good one of the things theyre being taught is to coach themselves in competitive situations they dont need another layer
609186 she was pretty obsessed in those early days hyper focused
609187 to us this was an activity katie was doing we werent immersed in it
609188 it was really very easy with katie because she was so motivated
609189 werent stopwatch parents they werent in the stands clocking splits
609190 i could have had the worst swim of my life and been really angry and disappointed with myself
609191 they never made me feel like i was beth their daughter the swimmer i was always beth their daughter
609192 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
609193 ik weet dat ik op de 200 vrij normaal gesproken alleen michael phelps voor me hoef te dulden maar ook die is niet onverslaanbaar de 100 vrij is echter een afstand waar ik bezeten van ben om mijn ultieme droom op dat nummer na te jagen moet alles wijken zelfs een medaille die me op een ander nummer niet lijkt te kunnen ontgaan
609194 i think im a hipster some of these items are in my closet
609195 theres no question that this has created a lot of fear and angst
609196 i tell people that investing in the market is like walking upstairs with a yo yo
609197 for a hundred years the market has climbed but it has bounced up and down like that yo yo i want people to understand that even if the market is down it will come back they will make a gain over their initial investment
609198 weve always felt that real estate is the most solid investment even with the ups and downs
609199 we feel people moving from california where there is no place to grow and the snowbirds will be part of the upturn in las vegas
609200 it isnt so much that the markets have changed but the responsibility has shifted to the employees
609201 if they make a bad decision or pay a manager too much to run it they may not be able to retire
609202 when you get erosion both because of a slowing economy as well as investor confidence you get whacked from both sides
609203 what you get now is the fear factor they think ive been getting all this income for years and can i continue to count on it
609204 we have had a number of calls from people who hear in the news that the government hasnt had to bail out an investment bank since the depression they are afraid and want to move out of the stock market and into cds insured savings accounts or money market accounts
609205 but between taxes and inflation we tell them they are going broke safely
609206 what were telling them is this is not a good time for them to make a change they probably bought their shares at higher prices and if they sell theyll be locking in a loss
609207 if they can ride it out for a year or two then maybe they can shift into a more conservative position
609208 here is what concerns me the savings and loan scandal the energy scandal with enron and what has happened with the subprime
609209 were seeing more and more retirees coming in for estate planning because of the markets
609210 were in a bubble and it will take several years to get out of it
609211 i dont see august 24 as the defining moment in my life
609212 sure it is a great opportunity perhaps one of the greatest opportunities i will ever have in my life but life will go on i have learned that each day is equally precious
609213 i have believed that i can run with the best guys in the world ever since i was fifteen years old
609214 i think the results from the london marathon really made other people believe that i do have a good shot at a medal in beijing
609215 the pride we have for what hes been able to accomplish its not every day a small town gets an olympian coming from it
609216 it gives the opportunity for kids here to relate that you can become a world class doctor lawyer whatever you want to be theres been a feeling that its a small town and kids growing up here dont have that exposure hes given inspiration to the whole community
609217 but a homegrown kid to make it on this level
609218 all the olympic hype has been much crazier then i imagined
609219 it has been a challenge to try and fulfill all my media obligations while still doing everything possible to make sure i give myself a shot at a medal in beijing
609220 this is probably the first major recession brought about by speculation and wall street
609221 i dont think enough has been made of that this is not your ordinary recession where consumer demand goes down and production goes down this is massive trauma a speculative earthquake that is ricocheting throughout our economy from the crooks and gamblers on wall street
609222 helped wreck wall street with his reckless management of citigroup
609223 when you deregulate these giant financial institutions greed has no boundaries no prudent restraints
609224 with the bailout power there should be taxpayer investment so if they turn these companies around the taxpayers get paid handsomely
609225 no one knows how god will end this book but he always saves the best for last
609226 gods not going to give you more than you can handle
609227 but when youre in it you dont know its hard times
609228 his slave master hated slavery so he went up to iowa
609229 boy meets girl boy gets girl boy loses girl boy regains girl
609230 maybe he just never knew how much he was loved
609231 never be able to make sense of what it was steven saw
609232 we try to supply people with the basic needs but if there is someone who needs some additional support we try to refer them to their center
609233 my office has dealt with families from all over the bay area and i can tell you these losses are devastating parents brothers and sisters and other loved ones are often caught completely off guard and are deeply shocked
609234 for once something has come up to overshadow the weather as a discussion topic it is something too of greater importance
609235 not since the united states entered world war i has there been such a patriotic spirit shown in henderson
609236 everyone seems eager to rally to the call of the president in his fight against the depression
609237 this is only a part of the results that can be expected from the recovery movement as a number of concerns have not yet accepted codes pending further information from washington as to their particular lines of business
609238 nra cards are going into additional display windows each day the forces of roosevelts recovery army being augmented as the spirit of the drive spreads
609239 a clear conception of the fundamentals of the nra campaign
609240 hey its a lot of money but thats a lot of quilt
609241 well i dont smoke or drink but i did try both
609242 and i only had one wife 63 years of good marriage
609243 sam comes into the cafe a couple of times a week for coffee and i knew he was around 100
609244 since im on the rutland centennial committee i asked him if he wanted to be involved hes in amazing shape and his mind is all there too theres some good genes in that family
609245 i certainly wont be making a speech or anything like that
609246 but if people want to ask a couple of questions i can answer them
609247 i worked there for 22 years and ive been drawing a pension from them for 36 years now
609248 i decided not to buy another house in rutland because i was old and i thought id just be renting for a few years
609249 i wish i would have bought especially considering whats happened with the housing market here
609250 he used to be so loving and attentive after he got back he was always tense he looked scared
609251 i knew right away when he got back from the war that something was wrong with him
609252 he used to be so loving and attentive after he got back he was always tense he looked scared
609253 if we tried to go anywhere the people and the noise would bother him so much that wed have to leave so we stopped going places
609254 its hard to re engage in civilian life and have the things that matter to your friends and family matter to you everything seems so trivial compared to the life and death of war
609255 a big part of being able to discuss their trauma has to do with the details of their shared experience the names of forward operating bases the challenges of living in extreme heat the threat of roadside bombs and car bombs
609256 are at a different stage of life just starting out with marriages and raising young children their concerns are more immediate controlling their behavior and being able to deal with anger and conflict
609257 i either couldnt feel anything or i would lose my temper and black out from rage
609258 i couldnt sleep i couldnt make decisions my wife and i couldnt get along
609259 finally it reached the breaking point and i had to do something
609260 but i couldnt relate to their experience because it was such a different war
609261 finding other vets from the same war is what helped me the most
609262 im closer with those guys now than with anybody else
609263 every time we had a patrol go out they always took small arms fire rocket propelled grenades hand grenades and there were a lot of ieds homemade bombs the military refers to as improvised explosive devices
609264 at the time you just have to shut everything down inside and keep going you have to do your mission with a clear mind or youre putting yourself and the people you work with in danger
609265 i would see people worried about breaking a nail or getting their car chipped totally missing the big picture of life not knowing that they could die at any instant
609266 i realized i wasnt really being a father to them
609267 hes a whole lot more outgoing and communicative its still a daily struggle but im slowly getting my husband back
609268 but i realized we needed to be even more careful with how we spent our money
609269 we need to bring back thriftiness that used to be a national value
609270 today it seems its all about consumption spending money on movies clothes and cars and its gotten us into trouble now i hope whats going on with economy will make thriftiness cool again
609271 after you do something like that you kind of get hooked
609272 i used to manage sales rooms in florida for travel packages and have been a work from home dad for almost 5 years now
609273 i love the travel business and having a home business

609290 this years back to school season without question is continued belt tightening as the consumer tries to stretch the dollar as far as possible
609291 we dont know how big of an element that is yet but i dont think our gas prices and food prices are going to go back to where they were
609292 since october consumers have been telling us thats what they were going to do and so far consumers have basically done what they said they would
609293 this year there will be a lot of people who will not be spending at all
609294 over the years summer jobs have provided about 19 percent of the dollars teenagers and college students spend of their own money on back to school apparel
609295 thats a huge shift out there that cant be replaced
609296 when gas prices are 4 a gallon the lava lamp gets crossed off the list
609297 i am waiting calmly to see what eventually happens the truth is that im happy
609298 yes for me its a dream to play for real madrid and if in the end this agreement is closed i will be a very happy man
609299 the ability to derive als motor neurons through a simple skin biopsy opens the doors to improved drug discovery for the first time researchers will be able to look at als cells under a microscope and see why they die if we can figure out how a persons motor neurons die we will figure out how to save motor neurons
609300 for the first time we have the opportunity to examine cellular and molecular defects in motor neurons and glial cells derived from patients with als and we can now begin drug screens on disease specific classes of human motor neurons
609301 through the work of the jenifer estess laboratory for stem cell research we now can glimpse the new age of als research an age of progress and promise
609302 it has been a privilege to collaborate with kevin eggan and his team and to contribute to this critical step forward we will continue to work hand in hand with harvard researchers and project a l s to exploit the potential of these cells for drug screening
609303 this patient registry assessed the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic circumferential balloon based ablation using radiofrequency energy for the treatment of be hgd at 16 u s academic and community institutions
609304 results were promising showing that 90 2 percent of patients were free of high grade dysplasia at an average of one year follow up and avoided many of the adverse events associated with other modalities currently used with this disease
609305 they spurs are a club with great tradition but since they are not a team playing in the champions league we spartak himself and his agent are more likely than not to reject their offer
609306 i love the premier league and i would certainly like to play there
609307 i intend to turn the matter over to the state lemon laws
609308 the amount of lemon law coverage you have might depend on the number of wheels you have four wheels youre probably covered three probably not two wheels its 50 50 a lot of states dont cover motorcycles it makes no logical sense
609309 i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
609310 its a big step from running a lemonade stand on the corner to a lemonade stand online
609311 the concept of a lemonade stand simply communicates what were all about and harkens back to a warm and friendly time in our life
609312 definitely beats mowing lawns its kind of fun to look at your account and see money flowing in
609313 im in the office most of the time we serve as support for the rest of the department
609314 i like to interview customers who have overcome the odds or are experiencing difficulties
609315 i can share that information with others who may be having those same issues
609316 the well being of any marylander in need any vulnerable person
609317 think about child welfare in maryland and imagine three people in this office trying to make sure the information going out is accurate it really challenges my organizational skills you have to really be on top of your game
609318 it wasnt long ago i was on the other side of that coin ill never forget that one paycheck can do it
609319 to mention anything concerning a person that he would dislike
609320 this effort aims to go beyond mere prevention by promoting ongoing treatment for mothers and their babies
609321 our aim is to fund the most effective and appropriate medicines and diagnostics on the market for both women and children
609322 testing pregnant women for hiv gives mothers a better chance to survive this disease
609323 women their children and their entire communities benefit when life saving treatment is provided to hiv positive mothers as quickly as possible
609324 women are one of the main target groups for who action
609325 women play an important role in the functioning of communities in caring for and educating children and make invaluable contributions to societies development
609326 our goal was to investigate the relationships among drinking aggression and mood what we found in the very high odds of sexual and physical aggression on heavy drinking days indicates major consequences of binge drinking for women that no research study had previously established
609327 these findings provide support for the need to develop intervention programs targeted to this problem
609328 in addition they help define characteristics that put women at increased risk for aggression regardless of alcohol consumption women who enter college with a history of experiencing aggression or a history of heavy drinking are at greater risk for later aggression as are women who experience depression or anxiety while in college
609329 in contrast to the accepted view the brain does use fat as fuel
609330 our study shows that the minute by minute control of appetite is regulated by free radicals implying that if you interfere with free radicals you may affect eating and satiety
609331 that each time a feeling of fullness or satiety is reached during a meal you may be chipping away some time from your maximum lifespan as the most free radicals are produced when satiety promoting brain cells are active
609332 the timing of taking antioxidants may be critical for the control of appetite
609333 if taken on an empty stomach antioxidants may further increase appetite however when taken with food they may affect satiety further studies are needed to determine whether any regiment of orally taken antioxidants could be used to control appetite in animals and humans
609334 in our experiments concepts presented early in a poem or prose passage were more available when alliterative sounds overlapped between lines than when there was no overlap
609335 we have formed a team of experienced outstanding researchers who have been working on this problem and meeting in cleveland regularly to share their results for the past four years
609336 it is very gratifying to receive the nihs support for this very important work abnormally high levels of immune activation were described in the first reports of aids in 1981
609337 what has not been appreciated until relatively recently is the resultant damage to the immune system that seems to be caused by this activation our projects hope to shed light on how hiv causes immune activation and eventually leads to immune deficiency
609338 most importantly the unknown number of women with hiv infection who are giving birth undiagnosed emphasises the need to ensure all women have access to hiv testing and the potential benefits for their health and the health of their babies
609339 opponents of relationship recognition for same sex couples often say that we have to protect children or that same sex relationships are against god but this study suggests that lesbians and gay men who seek relationship recognition may be acting to protect their children and enact their own religious beliefs
609340 faith communities may be important sources of legal education and advocacy for same sex couples
609341 couples may be using commitment rituals to build cohesion within stepfamilies as the role of gay and lesbian stepparents is often vague such ceremonies may help couples validate their sense of belonging and obligation to each other while also demonstrating to friends and relatives that they are a family unit
609342 its interesting that couples were motivated to have a commitment ceremony when their children were at this developmental stage just starting their own romantic explorations there may be an element of parenting going on here with couples wanting to give their children an example of commitment by formalizing their own its an interesting question for future research
609343 this study is an important contribution because it separates the legal and ritualistic aspects of solidifying a relationship not all same sex couples want legal protection or ritual recognition however those who do appear to take these steps for the same reasons straight people often do parenthood and religious commitment
609344 this common ground should be part of our policy debates
609345 the collaboration between the asm and find will focus on strengthening the foundation for infectious disease diagnosis in resource poor nations providing novel diagnostics and laboratory expertise for tuberculosis and other infectious diseases that are appropriate to the unique circumstances found in developing nations
609346 we expect our partnership to reinforce the expansion and further development of quality assured laboratory services as part of a larger framework of health system strengthening within resource poor settings combating poverty related infectious diseases with the development and rapid introduction of new diagnostic tests where they are most needed is why partnerships like the one between find and asm are extremely important
609347 its an exciting discovery yet in a lot of ways it just makes a lot of sense
609348 you clearly dont want to hang around or adapt to a temperature that could kill you but on the other hand if you cant find your favorite temperature it is ok to adapt to another comfortable temperature
609349 it turns out these larvae can discriminate one degree differences they prefer 18 over 19 degrees
609350 we think its important for adaptation if a fly finds itself at 34 degrees 93 degrees f it should never try to adapt to that temperature because it will die
609351 but flies living at 22 degrees could adapt to this environment because while this temperature isnt their optimal choice it still isnt deleterious
609352 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
609353 ours is by far the largest case control study of flu vaccine in the elderly
609354 we tried to overcome the limits of previous studies done by others
609355 those studies may have overestimated the benefits of the flu vaccine in the elderly for various reasons
609356 they are less likely than younger healthier seniors to go out and get vaccinated and more apt to develop pneumonia
609357 thats why our study used a control time period after flu vaccine became available but before each flu season actually started
609358 because those who got the vaccine happened to be healthier not because the flu vaccine was protecting them from pneumonia caused by the flu since it wasnt present yet
609359 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
609360 the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
609361 people age 65 and older should still get yearly flu vaccines as usual
609362 we first published the sets in 2004 and published guidance for the sets in 2006 we are now reviewing the sets to ensure they continue to be fit for purpose
609363 it was mind boggling because it went completely against what we had expected to see happening
609364 once we figured out what was happening however the results were very clear
609365 in the past many believed that cell specialization or differentiation was a terminal state there was no going back or getting young again
609366 but now not only do we know this reversion happens naturally we also have a very tractable genetic system in which to study it
609367 i had about four different hypotheses to explain why i couldnt see any of these cells crossing the dorsal trunk
609368 it took quite a while to convince ourselves what was truly going on
609369 to find two very different kinds of progenitor cells in a single fruit fly tissue raises the possibility that there may be more than one kind of adult stem cell in mammalian tissue
609370 it may be that organisms use both quiescent undifferentiated cells and more highly differentiated yet reversible facultative stem cells under different conditions
609371 although it wasnt expected drosophila have clearly taken advantage of this biological capacity during metamorphosis
609372 the stem cell community is debating whether every mammalian tissue relies on conventional adult stem cells of the sort already identified in bone marrow and muscle or if instead there are facultative stem cells that can arise from differentiated cells within the tissue now we know that it doesnt necessarily have to be one or the other it could be both
609373 i dont feel bad i just feel very sad ive lost a super yacht that was less than a year old
609374 you observe animals using the sense of smell to find food and you assume that this sensory modality must be important for survival but what we wanted to do is demonstrate it scientifically and in a rigorously controlled way
609375 if smell is so important then why are these odor blind animals doing as well as the animals that have a very good nose
609376 when the first cup of food was exhausted the animals with the normal sense of smell started to forage and very efficiently found that second cup much more so than those with the simple nose
609377 the odor blind animals didnt have a sense of smell to guide them
609378 its a simple demonstration that in times of plenty the sense of smell is irrelevant for survival
609379 but in times of scarcity when you really need to use that sensory modality to forage for food those without it have a competitive disadvantage
609380 no one has ever managed to isolate these neurons from a patient and grow them in a dish
609381 now we can make limitless supplies of the cells that die in this awful disease
609382 kevin eggan is an international leader in stem cell research and this is a pathbreaking discovery one that will bring us closer to the answers we seek about the most devastating diseases of our time
609383 we are truly excited to have played a role in making it possible
609384 its essential to note that we couldnt possibly be where we are now without first doing extensive work with human embryonic stem cells
609385 it will be essential to continue to do work with embryonic stem cells as they remain the stem cell gold standard
609386 the new york stem cell foundations support was integral to our ability to pursue this research
609387 private funding continues to play a critical role in driving the research that is helping us to understand diseases as never before nyscf is a nimble and focused organization that can keep pace with the needs of researchers as the pace of our work continues to intensify
609388 should be the same as if a police officer or emergency worker is assaulted
609389 people are particularly vulnerable who serve in these public roles
609390 and im really glad your story was on the front page theres a lot more of this going on than people realize
609391 los toreros respetamos m s a los antitaurinos que ellos a nosotros
609392 defender el derecho a escolarizar exclusivamente en castellano es arrebatar derechos a los ciudadanos que viven y trabajan en catalu a

609395 orang kami mahukan keamanan di mindanao dan ia telah menjadi isu yang dipercakapkan sejak sekian lama
609396 sudah tentu kita akan membuat pemantauan pilihan raya kecil ini dengan dekat supaya tidak timbul kekecohan dan lebih memarakkan lagi kalau timbul perpecahan di kalangan rakyat itu perkara yang kita perlu lihat secara profesional
609397 jika perundangan dipolitikkan dan politik dicampur dengan undang undang itu yang akan merosakkan perjalanan negara kita biarlah dua saluran pertarungan yang terpaksa dihadapi oleh anwar dibuat mengikut saluran masing masing
609398 objektif penubuhan pasukan berkenaan adalah bagi mendekatkan golongan terbabit dengan masyarakat melalui aktiviti seperti bergotong royong

609400 you get to know the idiosyncrasies of the place youre visiting you become more well informed than most travelers
609401 when youre really settled in a place it allows you to have these ambitious goals
609402 i got to sample a little bit of all of new york
609403 and now i have a sense of where i want to go when i move back for good
609404 break their vcr if i find out they broke mine
609405 i dont know how bands just starting out can do it
609406 to have two bands going out together with the same old school mentality about touring is cool
609407 concerts are so damned expensive its a chance to come together and see us for the same price
609408 because weve always liked their music and theyve always been incredibly supportive of us
609409 this is a really good pairing sometimes well open other times theyll open its no big deal its the music thats important
609410 its not like we planned to have such a long stretch between cds it just happened that way
609411 we didnt know what to expect from the first album then when it hit we toured for like three years straight we were overwhelmed and really fried it took a while for things to settle down when we got back in the studio we made a decision that we were going to take our time
609412 we wanted something that would jump off the tape i think we succeeded
609413 thats amazing youre the first person thats caught up with that
609414 musical tastes are changing every day we plan to roll with the times in a graceful way but we will be true to ourselves
609415 my dad taught me early its ok to cry im really emotional and really spiritual
609416 theres stuff that made this record that might not have if jeffrey hadnt gone through losing his son and mom hadnt got diagnosed toward the end of making the record
609417 so there are things on there that got a little darker and deeper
609418 after mom got diagnosed with brain cancer through that next six months everything about her was beginning to change
609419 it wasnt the same mom and i was already missing who she was
609420 most of the calls we were getting at radio stations were people who had lost someone in the war or who had lost a parent or son or daughter and it was beginning to touch more people like that
609421 i wanted to make it about loss and a tribute to my mom and everything we were going through as a family
609422 it sucks someone so full of life and so good and so godly and righteous who gave her life to so many other people that they have to go through something like that
609423 you cant second guess why god does things but its been hard coming to grips with that thank god shes not in pain anymore and she has a full healthy body and shes right there where shes always wanted to be anyway right there in the arms of god and jesus
609424 you have to believe god puts people in your life for a reason
609425 its a group of guys who really know what im going through and know how to help me get through this
609426 dad loved it she said things beer run was my first cut i said arent you excited its garth brooks and george jones and she said it doesnt glorify jesus i was like oh mom it will make a lot of money ill buy you something cool
609427 aha en rev eller elg eller r dyr eller what ever men jeg vil skyte etter det
609428 wed all hang out after the show and order steaks and sandwiches and james would order a plain chicken breast and vegetables
609429 who wouldve thought when we were doing the show that one day someone would actually be paying us to make a movie
609430 with all of those guys its just mad bro love
609431 he just had this loose notion of wanting to do what he called
609432 a rollercoaster ride of fun there was no drama whatsoever both seth and james have it down for them its about working with friends and having a good time
609433 and we were inspired by anything with brian bosworth in it anything with an ex football player turned actor in it were big fans of that
609434 more of a romantic comedy than a look at the porn industry
609435 basically we live in a world where on screen you can disembowel someone in a youth hostile in romania but you cant show people having sex
609436 evan and i have always wanted to make a sidekick movie
609437 the green hornet movie was up for grabs we thought it could be the most perfect way to do this story
609438 vi kommer att forts tta att vara en sen i skon och finne i h cken f r dumheten versitteriet och det dunkelt t nkta ven om vi r tio r f re v r tid
609439 this is a technique that was created by renaissance painters
609440 it will teach you how to look outside the box
609441 i started my school because i believe everyone can learn and everyone can learn to draw
609442 and art meets a lot of needs for a lot of children
609443 the camp is designed to teach the children photography techniques that can be applied at home
609444 children are growing up with digital cameras and i want to help develop their skills
609445 ive learned how to make a drawing look more interesting and how to align a subject on paper
609446 i have to think about what i want to put on my drawing and where
609447 i like art because you get to create your own things with different colors of the rainbow
609448 nicki provides her with information about the technical aspects of art
609449 and her pictures and drawings progress throughout the week its really amazing to see how much her work has improved
609450 and how big i want things in the pictures i take to be in my drawings
609451 when you put the picture in the right place it looks better
609452 i used colored pencils today to add detail and this also makes the drawing look better
609453 i know how to make sure light is on my side or the sun is to my back when i take photos im pretty sure that the camp is helping make my drawing and photography skills better
609454 some of the children have gained so much confidence because of what they were able to create
609455 you know i dont want to go back to your hotel room too late
609456 dont you see what aisha has done she has made allahs apostle and the people stay where there is no water and they have no water with them
609457 you have detained allahs apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water with them
609458 o the family of abu bakr this is not the first blessing of yours
609459 i have been given five things which were not given to any one else before me
609460 i borrowed a necklace from asma and it was lost so allahs apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it then the time of the prayer became due and there was no water they prayed without ablution and informed allahs apostle about it so the verse of tayammum was revealed
609461 may allah reward you by allah whenever anything happened which you did not like allah brought good for you and for the muslims in that
609462 do you remember that you and i became junub while both of us were together on a journey and you didnt pray but i rolled myself on the ground and prayed i informed the prophet about it and he said it would have been sufficient for you to do like this the prophet then stroked lightly the earth with his hands and then blew off the dust and passed his hands over his face and hands
609463 ablution meaning tayammum here is sufficient for a muslim if water is not available
609464 we were in a detachment and became junub and i blew the dust off my hands performed the rolling over the earth and prayed
609465 i rolled myself in the dust and came to the prophet who said passing dusted hands over the face and the backs of the hands is sufficient for you
609466 there is no harm or it will not be harmful depart
609467 o so and so what has prevented you from praying with us
609468 i was there at the place of water this hour yesterday and my people are behind me
609469 do you mean the man who is called the sabi with a new religion
609470 we have not taken your water but allah has given water to us
609471 a strange thing two men met me and took me to the man who is called the sabi and he did such and such a thing by allah he is either the greatest magician between this and this gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth or he is allahs true apostle
609472 i think that these people leave you purposely have you got any inclination to islam
609473 the one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion
609474 the sabis are a sect of people of the scripture who recite the book of psalms
609475 if one does not find water for ablution can he give up the prayer
609476 if you give the permission to perform tayammum they will perform tayammum even if water was available if one of them found it cold
609477 o abu abdurrahman what is your opinion if somebody becomes junub and no water is available
609478 what do you say about the statement of ammar who was ordered by the prophet to perform tayammum
609479 dont you see that umar was not satisfied by ammars statement
609480 all right leave ammalrs statement but what will you say about this verse of tayammum
609481 if we allowed it then they would probably perform tayammum even if water was available if one of them found it water cold
609482 while i was sitting with abdullah and abu musa al ash ari the latter asked the former if a person becomes junub and does not find water for one month can he perform tayammum and offer his prayer
609483 abu musa said havent you heard the statement of ammar to umar
609484 allahs apostle sent you and me out and i became junub and rolled myself in the dust clean earth for tayammum
609485 o so and so what prevented you from offering the prayer with the people
609486 o allahs apostle i am junub and there is no water
609487 perform tayammum with clean earth and that will be sufficient for you
609488 the first day when he came here he said dont anyone ever call me crash and so i always call him crash
609489 hes like i just told all the guys not to call me crash and im like yeah but im your wife i can call you crash we have a very sarcastic relationship
609490 at the time they didnt think that was going to be much of a problem
609491 i am most excited to see the state of utah blow up when two undefeated teams match up for a bcs bowl berth in the final game of the season one where utah will reclaim its rightful perch as the best football team and school if there was a doubt in the state
609492 this year i want to see if utah can get over the hump and have another 10 win conference championship season
609493 i want a win over byu and i dont want to suffer through more heartbreaking conference losses
609494 im so excited about byu football that i paid several hundred dollars to have a 125 foot pine tree taken out of my yard so the satellite can have a clear path as i can finally watch byu destroy everybody that steps in their way this season
609495 i am most excited to see the state of utah blow up when two undefeated teams match up for a bcs bowl berth in the final game of the season one where utah will reclaim its rightful perch as the best football team and school if there was a doubt in the state
609496 this year i want to see if utah can get over the hump and have another 10 win conference championship season
609497 i want a win over byu and i dont want to suffer through more heartbreaking conference losses
609498 its nothing bad we just want to make sure it doesnt linger throughout the year
609499 as the pain subsides he will increase his activity if the pain stays low we will increase the activity so it is basically a day to day week to week type thing
609500 he doesnt know if he has the time for football anymore
609501 hes in several business ventures and hes doing pretty well for himself so he doesnt know if he has the passion for football right now
609502 we signed him late and weve been real pleased that we signed him
609503 ive been shopping a couple times looking for one i can fold up ive had to go to stores buy a chair then return it when im done
609504 we do the best we can with our budgets and our coaches are pretty frugal but no one could have predicted this
609505 we may have to go back to eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

609507 the sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someones death so whenever you see these eclipses pray and invoke allah till the eclipse is over
609508 the sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death of someone from the people but they are two signs amongst the signs of allah when you see them stand up and pray
609509 the sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life i e birth of someone but they are two signs amongst the signs of allah when you see them offer the prayer
609510 the sun eclipsed in the life time of allahs apostle on the day when his son ibrahim died

609512 the sun and the moon are two signs against the signs of allah they do not eclipse on the death or life of anyone so when you see the eclipse remember allah and say takbir pray and give sadaqa
609513 o followers of muhammad by allah there is none who has more ghaira self respect than allah as he has forbidden that his slaves male or female commit adultery illegal sexual intercourse o followers of muhammad by allah if you knew that which i know you would laugh little and weep much
609514 when the sun eclipsed in the life time of allahs apostle an announcement was made that a prayer was to be offered in congregation
609515 sami a l lahu lyman hamidah rabbana walak lhamd allah heard him who sent his praises to him
609516 the sun and the moon are two of the signs of allah they do not eclipse because of the death or the life i e birth of someone when you see them make haste for the prayer
609517 when the sun eclipsed at medina your brother abdullah bin az zubair offered only a two rakat prayer like that of the morning fajr prayer
609518 yes for he missed the prophets tradition concerning this matter
609519 the sun and the moon are two of the signs of allah they do not eclipse yakhsifan because of the death or the life i e birth of someone so when you see them make haste for the prayer
609520 the sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of allah and they do not eclipse because of the death of someone but allah frightens his devotees with them
609521 may allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave
609522 the sun and the moon are two of the signs of allah they eclipse neither because of the death of somebody nor because of his life i e birth so when you see them remember allah
609523 o allahs apostle we saw you taking something from your place and then we saw you retreating
609524 i saw paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch of its fruits and had i taken it you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains i also saw the hell fire and i had never seen such a horrible sight i saw that most of the inhabitants were women
609525 they are ungrateful to their companions of life husbands and ungrateful to good deeds
609526 i came to aisha the wife of the prophet p b u h during the solar eclipse the people were standing and offering the prayer and she was also praying too i asked her what has happened to the people she pointed out with her hand towards the sky and said subhan allah i said is there a sign she pointed out in the affirmative
609527 i too then stood up for the prayer till i fainted and then poured water on my head
609528 may allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave
609529 the sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someones death or life but they are two signs amongst the signs of allah so pray whenever you see them
609530 the sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someones life or death but they are two signs amongst the signs of allah which he shows to his worshipers so whenever you see them make haste for the prayer
609531 these signs which allah sends do not occur because of the life or death of somebody but allah makes his worshipers afraid by them so when you see anything thereof proceed to remember allah invoke him and ask for his forgiveness
609532 the sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of allah they do not eclipse because of someones death or life so when you see them invoke allah and pray till the eclipse is clear
609533 the sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of allah they do not eclipse because of the death of someone and so when an eclipse occurs pray and invoke allah till the eclipse is over
609534 sami al l ahu lyman hamidah rabbana walaka l hamd
609535 in the life time of allahs apostle the sun eclipsed and he made a person to announce prayer in congregation he led the prayer and performed four bowing and four prostrations in two rakat
609536 i asked ursa what did your brother abdullah bin azzubair do he prayed two rakat of the eclipse prayer like the morning prayer when he offered the eclipse prayer in median ursa replied that he had missed i e did not pray according to the prophets tradition
609537 its going to be fun i dont know if fun is the right word its going to be an honor and a thrill to go up before the game to shake his hand and chat i hope he talks to me
609538 i dont give a expletive if this is special teams or not we are rolling
609539 obviously id like to have the job right off the bat but i know that nothing worthwhile comes easy so if im going to be the guy im going to have to work and continue to get better
609540 my role is to attack each rep like im still the starter and just to work hard and try to make the other guys better
609541 i still see myself as a leader on the team so i try to get everybody on the same page and make sure that were all growing up together
609542 these guys have worked hard morning after morning they got out today and did the same thing they need the rest we need to get them off their legs we need to get them home with their wives and kids for 24 hours im proud of them im happy with the way theyve worked
609543 i think its too early to be able to separate yet because we havent had any game action
609544 nobody has jumped ahead of the other guys in the live action or the drills significantly enough to say its a 1 2 3 we all got our opinions but one thing for certain theyve all gotten better
609545 in my faith as a christian i believe that we all have a purpose on earth initially ive always been into politics and civil rights issues but the more i thought about it and the more i meditate on it ive come to believe that a livable environment is the most basic of human rights thats why i feel strongly compelled to work that way
609546 what smith did was wrong and we take very serious and he is being punished severely for it
609547 he knows what those are and we will move forward
609548 i know hes extremely remorseful and he understands but if we want to be a good football team we have to win without him
609549 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made
609550 you bet your life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
609551 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
609552 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
609553 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
609554 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
609555 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night

609557 it is true that youngs rhetoric during a time of war was part of the backdrop against which the massacre happened
609558 a systematic effort to cover up and destroy records diaries and court records of the day
609559 we have got to give a lot of credit to the lds church for stepping up and owning the mountain meadows massacre
609560 this is something that has been swept under the rug denied and hidden for 151 years this book represents a real paradigm shift and thats remarkable
609561 we came up with the idea for the book ourselves we were not assigned to do it
609562 we sought the cooperation of church leaders to get access to information such as the first presidencys confidential collection but asked that we retain full editorial control and theyve honored that
609563 the trio of authors has properly tagged direct responsibility for the massacre on local church leaders and nauvoo legion officers with southern paiutes playing a minor role
609564 i give credit to the authors for this somewhat nontraditional view as well as their willingness to rescue the reputation of the victims from the appalling vilification thats taken place for 150 years they have also identified the impact of gov brigham youngs overheated rhetoric and provocative actions in helping to create a violent atmosphere in utah leading up to the massacre
609565 make obsolete previous studies and without doubt will constitute the necessary starting point for all future ones
609566 our marching orders as i understood them were to find the truth and tell it thats what we have tried to do
609567 my feeling is the best approach is to face it
609568 its a terrible sad story and a hard one to read we cant condone what they did but we can try to understand it good history brings you into the story in a way that you can understand yourself you should wonder what would i have done had i been there
609569 i never thought much about it until the first of the month july when i had to put her in the hospital because she was real sick
609570 i went all through the house looking for her and i went to the garage and the car wasnt there
609571 i waited until 5 a m to see if she might have just gone to the store to get something but i didnt think so and i called the police
609572 i was afraid when i saw the car gone that this what was going to happen
609573 i was writing my speech at the time and she said this would perfectly fit your theme
609574 i chose oregon because it was the only college that would accept me as a middle linebacker
609575 while dressing for the first practice i thought how strange it was that i was no 75
609576 remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck
609577 hes got such a great sense of humor i knew he would do well
609578 i thought he did a great job his humor made it
609579 the night before the game you get little or no sleep
609580 knowing that if you screw up you will forever be known as the guy who lost the franchise
609581 i was emotional i usually dont get that way i just lost it i got swept up in the moment
609582 when gary first asked me to be a presenter my first concern was i was going to have a difficult time explaining how good he really was
609583 offensive linemen get very little attention gary wanted very little of it there was no doubt in my mind he was the mainstay of our offensive line and a major reason why we were able to go and win our first super bowl in 1997
609584 there should be a stage full of guys standing up here receiving this honor with me
609585 then we can start filling this place up with our players
609586 i was a huge fan of his because he was the absolute best at what he did and he was quiet about it
609587 too many players in the nfl are too busy running their mouths zimmerman kept his mouth shut and did what he was supposed to i loved that about him
609588 our goal was to investigate the relationships among drinking aggression and mood what we found in the very high odds of sexual and physical aggression on heavy drinking days indicates major consequences of binge drinking for women that no research study had previously established
609589 these findings provide support for the need to develop intervention programs targeted to this problem
609590 in addition they help define characteristics that put women at increased risk for aggression regardless of alcohol consumption women who enter college with a history of experiencing aggression or a history of heavy drinking are at greater risk for later aggression as are women who experience depression or anxiety while in college
609591 they havent done anything to see what kind of damage was done to me
609592 the only way you can tell whats wrong is with an x ray
609593 guess what thats not abnormal or any different than it is on the street
609594 i have no incentive for this guy to be sick
609595 we really dont have much of a problem in tulsa county
609596 did not exhibit any issues that indicated he needed to be seen at that time
609597 ive got a lot of confidence in my medical provider and my medical staff
609598 we dont want to be one of those groups that comes back 15 years later and puts out an album thats not that good
609599 its why the beatles never got back together not to compare us to the beatles but expectations are so high
609600 cher told me that she wanted to be more naked
609601 its not vulgar but its quite shocking its like we dipped her in glue and rolled her in diamonds not enough of them to cover up the girl
609602 animo a todos los deportistas a no ignorar lo que ocurre cada uno puede sentar una se al a su manera ning n funcionario puede impedirlo
609603 his songs are often unplanned both music and lyrics erupting from somewhere deep inside the singer his sound is best described as raw unpolished and primal songs are stretched out many times improvisationally doubling in length as the wild piano pounding poet shouts of a tender gods love

609615 i just think that is an easy way to take one step toward being greener
609616 there is no vacancy for the post of the prime minister no applications are being invited or are necessary or are being entertained

609618 as long as we could stand commuting we really loved living there
609619 from our perspective it was the perfect place to raise a family away from the road with a stream and a bridge plenty of land for the kids to run around and explore things

609624 generally life on millers island is very low key peaceful and quiet
609625 we have no particular crime trends showing up in the community

609632 most of those buried at this site were children and there can be no harm in marking their grave
609633 the old falsified history is now being corrected under a democratic government

609677 ruud gullit cannot have the power that he has in the club because no club can give that much power to the coach
609678 you take the risk of losing your identity when you give one person so much power
609679 its bad for a player to point the finger at somebody else
609680 i asked him an interesting question can you do what i ask you to do he couldnt answer that its nothing personal but he is a bad apple
609681 ruud gullit needs to understand he cannot treat players the way he does
609682 many things the players dont agree with ruud gullits actions
609683 most of the players are not happy to be coached by ruud gullit they are afraid to talk back because they have non guaranteed contracts and can be traded
609684 in general the security of our players is not there
609685 i asked landon to do certain things and he wanted a different way
609686 he did it and acted as a real pro he scored a goal on a penalty kick and had an assist
609687 at the start i thought ruud liked me we seemed to get on but he didnt like being disagreed with and as captain my job was to put forward the players viewpoint
609688 by the end he didnt speak to me at all he didnt want me anywhere near the training ground
609689 i dont know how anyone could have left rob lee out of this team hes england class
609690 hopefully some guys figured out what needs to be done you have to show you care
609691 i think it will be particularly poignant that greg will be able to stand up and realize that those people were in those seats because they were given an invitation that chris had designed
609692 life is brief and can be taken from us at any moment
609693 i strongly dislike facial hair on guys hair just about anywhere else doesnt bother me but the likelihood of me dating a guy with facial hair is next to nil dont like the look cant deal with hair being that close to my mouth when kissing
609694 finally im sorry to say that it might take me an inordinately long time to write back the effort will not go unappreciated even if it does go unanswered for a while

609707 it is unconscionable that we could have come out with an outcome that rolled the global trading system back not by one year or five years but by 30 years
609708 life goes on you will have the food crisis you will have other crises protectionist interests will again present themselves
609709 my top tip when making investment decisions is that the most accurate information is provided by the organization that originally created the information
609710 i find myself referring to the following books all the time
609711 we got enough problems out there in the streets with these fucked up politicians and cops save that shit for the streets
609712 for these last eight years all weve heard about is a mysterious outside force that threatedns our security and our liveihood everyday
609713 and im not just talking about the bush administration but the whole sick conformist apparatus indecipherable
609714 theyre supposed to step up and be our voice and congress they turned their backs on us they turned their backs on the workers they turned their backs on the soldiers they got right behind bush lock step and got this country into another sick war
609715 now we know brother obama we know brother obama but i tell you what if he comes to power come november and he doesnt start pulling troops out of afghanistan i know a lot of people who are gonna stand up and burn down every office of every senate
609716 all this now weve been seeing is just the beginning its just the beginning
609717 this new generation of blacks and latinos indecipherable are gonna make this country an offer it cant refuse so wake up
609718 im going to ride this horse until its dead and flogged by mythos writer paul jenkins
609719 right now im working on an issue of amazing spider man
609720 if everything works out okay i wouldnt mind doing more in the future ive also got a few more covers for the twelve there may be some more ancient greeks in my future as well
609721 silver surfer and wolverine and i still wish we had gotten around to mythos specials on iron man and daredevil as for creators i just picked up the entire run of astonishing x men and was quite impressed so joss whedon comes to mind
609722 its not the sentiments of men which make history but their actions
609723 people are increasingly conscious of maintaining a healthy and more balanced lifestyle
609724 however they are not prepared to sacrifice on the experience
609725 to describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental
609726 i think of taxidermy as the ultimate in terms of conservation and wise use of our natural resources and trying to save this being considered one of americas treasures probably the worlds largest mounted fish maybe the largest piece of taxidermy in the world i felt it was worthy of saving
609727 does it have anything to do with the software and is it just emotional mental
609728 some of the very aggressive elements that ive outlined in my plan
609729 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here and if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
609730 i wanted to send a strong signal that we cant allow partisan bickering or the desire to score political points to get in the way of providing some genuine relief to people who are struggling
609731 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
609732 drilling provisions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect from a drilling agenda
609733 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
609734 wir m ssen flagge zeigen d rfen nicht beiseite stehen
609735 rein humanit r nat rlich und ganz ohne blutvergie en
609736 kampfeins tze sind jetzt nicht mehr so ganz auszuschlie en
609737 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
609738 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
609739 when is people going wake up and give credit where credit is due
609740 go away from my window leave at your own chosen speed
609741 i think we are in as good of a position as we were last year
609742 we can take a bit of a hit but its usually small and we expect that to be offset by a 5 plus percent increase in the tax rate
609743 i dont remember a time when my cuts have had to academically affect the performance of students before
609744 the reason we werent real aggressive on bus cuts is theres a point of diminishing returns
609745 theres only been four on time budgets in the last 20 years so this is pretty typical
609746 but the state faces a cash crisis we did not have in years past
609747 with that and some leaving because they moved we are fairly close to hiring everyone back who was laid off
609748 things that are important and help kids but are not part of the actual classroom instructional programs thats usually what suffers
609749 how many people will actually not have a job at the district is changing we had a retirement two days ago that we werent anticipating
609750 i still havent gotten all my cash from 2006 to 2007
609751 we did have a reading specialist position particularly for students in need of strengthening reading skills in the third through fifth grades at vineyard elementary
609752 we gave everybody a schedule and said if you want to do a field trip this is what it will cost to rent the bus
609753 it really brings back the memories a lot of the kids that i showed with are now here with their kids
609754 the kids are not only learning the responsibility of taking care of a large animal like a hog but also how to manage the related expenses
609755 it is a great way for them to learn these lessons and have fun doing it
609756 putting old people in front of young people its very important
609757 people who didnt know the music and took it someplace else
609758 its amazing how important the words are to these guys
609759 i was at woodstock and it rained there too and for three days not just for one day
609760 funny and smart chris has written some of the best lyrics ive ever heard by anyone on both of these albums voice is raspy and even bassier than tom waits the instrumentation is fucking incredible and he works with lots of different musicians on these albums the buffalo ny native puts out his music all by himself no music labels here comepletely diy with that said these are the best sounding albums of the 4 reviewed here today i like how this shit is deep but fun at the same time he writes serious lyrics about life while at the same time not taking things too seriously for too long clever as fuck cant pick a standout track too many gems here great tunes on both albums blues country and r amp b meet the bottom of a whiskey bottle i give them both a rating of 75 ill well worth the money 15 per cd free shipping unfortunately it took the fucking asshole a month to ship these cds to me a talented but lazy jack ass of a genius fuck you and thanks for the great tunes
609761 cynics and fans of dark humor rejoice lyrically and musically stunning a model of perfection
609762 by far the most polished professional sounding album i have heard from a buffalonian since i dont even know when
609763 if youre searching for a record equally at home in a 1930s speakeasy or a post punk new york club look no further
609764 surely one of the strongest collections of original songs to see independent release literate witty swinging musical as all get out
609765 along with energy policy political and economic systems must also evolve
609766 in other words we need a type 1 polity and economy along with the technology in order to become a type 1 civilization we are close if we use the kardashevian scale to plot humankinds progress it shows how far weve come in the long history of our species from type 0 and it leads us to see what a type 1 civilization might be like
609767 great paintings shouldnt be in museums museums are cemeteries paintings should be on the walls of restaurants in dime stores in gas stations in mens rooms great paintings should be where people hang out you pay half a million and hang one in your house and one guest sees it thats not art thats a shame a crime
609768 i was just drawing whatever i felt like drawing whenever i felt like doing it
609769 the idea was always to do it without affectation or self reference to provide some kind of panoramic view of the world as i was seeing it
609770 i was fascinated to learn of ingrids interest in my work
609771 if not for this interest i dont know if i even would have revisited them
609772 he has put down his guitar for a small amount of time and picked up a paintbrush and it seems to be that he is as adept with his paintbrush as he is with his guitar
609773 its not like the drawings were revolutionary they werent going to change anyones way of thinking
609774 its a little piece of history that people can have basically dylans signature
609775 i think people are buying the work not just for the artistic value but because of the signature on it
609776 what most surprised us in this survey was how it goes across all the generations it didnt matter if you were 16 or 65 the emotional importance of lyrics was completely consistent
609777 over de toestand en identiteit van de automobilist is nog niets bekend
609778 pop culture proves that teens are more ready than ever to disuss the subject of sex
609779 with recent reports showing that one out of four teenage girls has an std and the high level of teenage pregnancy we believe that miley is both influential and relatable to this afflicted set and is the obvious choice to get the message of safe sex out to teens across america
609780 lindsay had desperately wanted a part in the hit film
609781 then things got really ugly when amanda seyfried landed the starring role
609782 she cant understand whats happened to her career and is finding amandas recent success very difficult
609783 you know im very happy about that its not the thing that drives me by any stretch but the kind of jobs that ive held in media and others never would have had a pension that would have been attached to it of course ive done my own thing in rrsps and things but its nice that theres a little piece there for us when i do turn 55
609784 this revenue neutral scheme reminds me of a man and a horse
609785 the man is feeding hay to the horse and then he goes around to the other end to see if he gets the same amount out
609786 we cannot depend on the media to do this for us
609787 only those persons accredited as media may act as journalists reporters or in any other media capacity
609788 thats significant because cellphone use is a contributing factor to motor vehicle crashes
609789 why so many i dont know people may have forgotten or they may feel theres not much enforcement
609790 acadia has a long history of student research in several areas of priority interest to acadia and ducks unlimited canada
609791 to preserve conserve and restore our fragile ecosystems will require considerable research and investment and our students are uniquely positioned to participate in this work
609792 this is a considerable investment by ducks unlimited canada and we are pleased to be the institution that it has chosen to make this long term commitment to
609793 ducks unlimited canadas conservation programs across the country are guided by research and evaluation
609794 we are very excited about developing this program with acadia university so we can use their science expertise to deal with issues of importance in this part of the country
609795 any time you engage in negative campaigning you always run the risk of it backfiring on your own campaign
609796 that said people remember negative ads candidates use them because they are effective
609797 if they can capitalize on pre existing fears the electorate has about obama or hesitations they have about him it can be an effective strategy
609798 washington is full of talented talkers and senator obama is one of the best to come along in quite a while unfortunately on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
609799 we know theyre going to fight us tooth and nail
609800 theres a pretty vocal group of anti tax folks in torrance that we have to contend with and we really have to battle
609801 i think the climate is worse than it was two years ago
609802 were paying 4 a gallon for gasoline i dont see how you can sell the community on a bond that is going to tax us for the next 30 years
609803 people will be going to the polls on both sides of the issue
609804 but if it doesnt im hoping maybe theyll listen to some of the ideas i have
609805 with our closets and dressers full of moth eaten promotional t shirts we gamers arent exactly the best dressed people on the planet
609806 new mirrors edge gameplay footage has found its way to the web the video was shot at campus party 2008 in valencia spain and it comes in three parts
609807 of all the people ive had the privilege to break bread with
609808 now you have a chance to have dinner with her and if you contribute even as little as 5 today you can help hillary retire that pesky campaign debt and you and a guest might be sitting down to dinner with her soon
609809 obama has not picked up any ground against mccain on foreign issues
609810 so if sen mccain wants to debate taxes then im ready i was just reading that wild bill hickok he had the first duel in the town square here in springfield and i have not done all the full research on this but the family legend is that wild bill hickok hes a distant cousin of mine so were going to research that cause im ready to duel john mccain on taxes right now right here im a quick draw
609811 this is applicable to all cars owned by the government
609812 it is however not meant for cars used by the superintendent of police and the district magistrate
609813 the motion is meaningless and irrelevant and we shall continue our movement for self determination and the creation of a separate gorkhaland state
609814 i opened bodytalk fitness studio a year ago and thought about organising different ways to raise our profile and the competition seemed a great way to raise money for charities as well
609815 we chose make a wish along with cry as we wanted to support local childrens charities
609816 i didnt want to spend the summer in an office
609817 they didnt have the sense of what the other side thought
609818 if you vote for a candidate who loses the election then your views arent represented at all
609819 west bengal legislative assembly member from darjeeling mr gaulan lepchas speech to the floor
609820 they are good story ideas but see how you can relate issues of nepal and bhutan to your host city pittsburgh if the ideas are to be accepted
609821 you know how to report by observation now the next step is to be even more precise i dont mean that you should write more sentences i mean that you should choose the more precise words
609822 so far matters dealt with herein are concerned the treaty cancels all previous treaties agreements and engagements entered into on behalf of india between the british government and the government of nepal
609823 we should seize every opportunity to inspire our young people to leadership and this internship program will do just that
609824 where do we as a state want to take this
609825 there is no way that the industrys going away we know what its doing for the city and the state
609826 we need to think about how to ensure and continue the intangibles
609827 if louisiana gets cocky about that if we decide not to be aggressive if we decide to squeeze more out of this in the short term you can say goodbye to the film business
609828 we have a big education gap between the industry and the legislature
609829 at the end of the school year the elementary school sends a list and for the middle school its posted online
609830 weve got their school bags and everything is packed and ready to go
609831 when it goes on sale i buy plenty when she comes to me in the middle of the school year and says i need a notebook i pull it out of the closet
609832 make sure they know school is starting so therell be no stress on the first morning
609833 do whatever it takes a warm glass of milk a nice warm bath before they go to bed anything to calm them down dont assume theyll just do it
609834 you need to be in contact with the school board if you havent been notified about the bus yet make sure they know where the bus stop will be for pick up and drop off and at what time
609835 you also need to know what time the bell will ring and parents need to know what time they will be at home
609836 thats unsafe now be sure to include their moms name and dads name and address so we put them on the right bus
609837 were looking at a total ecological shift in the gulf as far as what lives there
609838 the maintenance building was a request i made about 10 years ago we have been able to met our need another way since we werent getting anywhere with the capital outlay process
609839 the plan is were going to put a chunk of the surplus into capital outlay
609840 this could potentially be one of the projects that could be funded its not out nothing happened to advance it this session but there are several projects that are in the same predicament like the cecil picard center
609841 i set the return to the middle of the field and then whenever i see a crease just take it thats what i did i saw the open field and i saw green grass and i took it
609842 i showed the coaches that im going to be the return guy
609843 and thats what ive come here to do so im ready to make plays
609844 he flattened me very well and i just did the job to go up there and make the play on it
609845 it was encouraging though green had a good return i thought he had a good catch but they ruled it out of bounds he knows what to do hes explosive so thats encouraging
609846 swimming advisory issued for this area high levels of bacteria have been detected and swimming is not advised this advisory will remain in effect until bacteria levels are in compliance
609847 we cant say for sure what it is right now people have been looking at this for years no clear cut answers emerge
609848 there is no difference before rita or after rita in the bacteria counts
609849 this indicates that the number of humans is not the cause
609850 every time the tarpon rodeo is held theyve got a lot of campers using the beach
609851 i dont know why its under an advisory a lot this season
609852 these microorganisms enter the body through the mouth nose and ears
609853 therefore swallowing the water or immersing ones head increases the risk of illness
609854 the guys who have been up here this summer working didnt have to be here they chose to be here they wanted to put in the work to get better
609855 its going to take some work some time and some putting it together but the benefits are im spending 1 a gallon
609856 the price of fuel doesnt look like its going to go down
609857 do you want to pay 1 a gallon or do you want to pay 4 70 a gallon

609867 i regret ot say that every year sees a considerable diminution in the number of the large trees in the streets many have to be removed to make provision for the erection of verandahs for street alterations
609868 some years ago queens road from the clock tower 1 to ice house lane was embowered with trees now not one remains there
609869 the long length of queens road also from the sailors home to the junction with eastern street was planted by myself in 1873 with the approval of the surveyor general all of which trees have been removed and so in other parts of the city when verandahs are built over the pathways at the sides of the sides of the streets the only space available for trees is monopolised
609870 we would have a very different cityscape if only the dedicated civil servant mr fords wonderfully chairvoyant suggestions were accepted and implemented

609925 its a shame i didnt manage to get the best out of the car in q3 mainly because of traffic especially on my second run in the first two parts of qualifying the car felt good as can be seen from my times but then i never managed to prepare the tyres in the best way clearly overtaking isnt easy but we have a good pace and i will try and exploit that in fighting with the two drivers ahead of me on the grid
609926 i made a mistake on my final flying lap which cost me precious time and that followed on from not having got a great lap on my previous attempt which explains why im sixth of course i am not happy and starting from the third row my race will be an uphill struggle i will try and make the most of this situation given that the car today was not that bad we are going through a bit of a difficult time but we mustnt give up all we need to do is put together all the pieces of the jigsaw and then the results will come to us again
609927 having our main rivals two cars on the front row is definitely not the most promising start for the race but it in no way means the race is already lost for us
609928 on top of that come the usual parameters strategy reliability team work that have to operate at their best in order to get a good result we have to try our hardest to bring home as many points as possible and only at the end of the race will we see if we have done enough or not
609929 we had a difficult start to this weekend but weve improved throughout the sessions and learnt a lot of things along the way we therefore werent looking too bad for qualifying i made a mistake on my fast lap in q1 and lost two and a half tenths in one corner so my q1 time did not show the true potential of our car we then had a good chance of making it into q3 but a hydraulic problem meant i couldnt go out at all in q2 which was disappointing its pretty interesting here tyre wise as both are very soft on this track but the harder ones were better for me today
609930 it was a difficult qualifying for me aside from plenty of traffic i didnt really manage to find the right balance on my last set of option tyres both factors compromised my run we now need to go through the data and work out whats happening in order to get the most out of the car for tomorrow
609931 it was always going to be a tight qualifying session for us unfortunately kazuki didnt progress through from the first session nico obviously could have delivered more but a hydraulic problem kept him in the garage for the whole of q2 there was no sign of it during the last run in q1 but it became apparent when we fired up for the second session were investigating the cause now and will resolve the problem in time for the race
609932 it was a hot tough qualifying and i am not 100 happy with the session the tyres did not behave as we expected and i had lots of graining which meant we couldnt get a good balance out of the car i decided to run the harder set of tyres in the end for my fastest lap but at least i didnt get the effects of the graining with them overall im not that happy but lets see what happens tomorrow
609933 conditions today were tough but actually that was the maximum we could do the target was to do a 1min 21 7 or 21 8 and we did a 21 6 so that was the most we could get out of the car the balance was not too bad but unfortunately the grip level is still very poor i think were not particularly quick round here and we have to accept that but we are still quite close we are to the others
609934 i think we expected to slip back a bit from our closest rivals due to not running the seamless shift and that proved to be the case giancarlo pretty much got the most out of it he could but unfortunately adrian couldnt get a decent lap together so was a way off his optimum time we know our race pace is better than our qualifying pace and although this makes life difficult at this track we have to get two cars to the end and do a professional job
609935 it would be very easy to say were on the back row again but weve been eliminated from q1 with a
609936 that was a pretty good qualifying session quite straightforward it would have been nice to have had a bit more pace in q3 but q2 and q1 went well for us im disappointed im on the wrong side of the grid an odd number is always better but we definitely have a chance to get something from where we are so well see how we go tomorrow
609937 i was losing a little bit of time in each of the sectors and i couldnt deliver that last little bit of lap time because i was bringing the mid corner speed too low its tough from thirteenth for sure but the hungarian race can be unpredictable so lets see
609938 a respectable qualifying from mark in a very tight field were close to our nearest rivals in toyota which should make for an interesting race tomorrow david isnt far off the back of that group he unfortunately didnt have a good second run in q2 but well be fighting hard tomorrow
609939 engine wise we have been completely clear all weekend which has allowed us to concentrate on the performance of both the car and the engine we would have preferred to have seen both cars appearing in q3 but we are sure david will be strong tomorrow mark has a good chance for a good race
609940 we knew that the qualifying session would be very close and that proved to be the case
609941 the session was very competitive and more difficult than i though it would be in the end i managed to reach q3 and i am happy about that it means we can approach the race sensibly tomorrow and i hope we can make the most of this grid position to score some points
609942 as always the homework done during our free practice sessions has paid off by getting both cars into the final part of qualifying with fuel loads that we believe can help us have a competitive race as everybody knows it is really difficult to pass on this track and so after a good qualifying session pit stops are now of extreme importance
609943 our objective was to reach the top ten and we achieved that but the gap with the leaders is significant and as fernando said at the start of the weekend we had to fight hard to finish in the top ten because that is the situation we are in at the moment with these places on the grid we are now preparing for a closely fought race but we have a sensible strategy each lap will count and we must not make any mistakes
609944 the team has done a fantastic job of continually improving the car over the past few weeks so im really proud of what weve achieved today
609945 theres a great harmony within the team at the moment and we really deserved this i couldnt ask to be in a better position weve both got good strategies for tomorrow and well be challenging for the win
609946 it was difficult to choose the right tyre for the final session and i felt i could have done a slightly faster lap in q3 but i was a little cautious in turn two still weve found a great direction with the car and ive got a great opportunity to win the race tomorrow
609947 its fantastic to be starting on the front row alongside lewis i hope that starting on the dirty side of the track wont be a disadvantage and i fully expect us to look out for each other in the first corner tomorrow this result really repays the team for all its efforts over the past few months
609948 a qualifying one two is a rare and pleasing achievement so i want to say a big thank you to all the people who worked so hard to make it possible and that includes everyone in woking mclaren in brixworth mercedes benz highperformanceengines and of course in stuttgart mercedes benz now we hope to convert our excellent qualifying performance into an equally solid race result
609949 a great performance by lewis heikki and our team a dream and our third pole in a row one from heikki two from lewis i hope we will be able to turn our grid positions into a similar result in the race tomorrow
609950 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine

609963 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
609964 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
609965 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
609966 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
609967 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
609968 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
609969 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
609970 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
609971 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
609972 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil

609977 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
609978 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
609979 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
609980 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
609981 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
609982 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
609983 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
609984 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
609985 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
609986 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
609987 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
609988 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
609989 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
609990 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
609991 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
609992 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021

609994 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
609995 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
609996 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
