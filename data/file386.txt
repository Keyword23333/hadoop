3860082 support for president saakashvili is now a matter of principle for the majority in georgia as we face a military aggression from russia
3860083 but when this nightmare and tragedy is over many of these people will start asking questions people understand that saakashvili made a mistake by not thinking about the consequences
3860084 it would have been better not to start this war in the first place but to seek a political solution
3860085 a lot of young people are dead now wheres the sense in this
3860086 it was a very well planned trap which we walked into

3860098 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3860099 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3860100 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3860101 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade

3860117 i gave these a b because it does what it says it will in terms of preserving your fruit and vegetables a little longer but it didnt make that much of a difference these bags kept my bananas fresh for about four to five days longer than a traditional bag and for about a week longer than no bag at all the strawberries made it three days longer in the green bags than with the plastic carton they came in after two weeks i noticed no real difference in my lettuce or tomatoes they do keep things fresher but not by such a huge margin that its worth my extra money for the bags
3860118 debbie meyer firmly stands by her product debbie meyer greenbags
3860119 i ended up giving this a c because they said you could make a coffee handle so i tried that and it broke right off it did a good job in terms of connecting two irrigation pipes and it worked and prevented water seepage but it didnt give me a lot of confidence it didnt seem to be a money saver for me i used the putty to make a handle for my coffee cup but even after allowing the putty to harden completely the handle came off the cup and my mug broke
3860120 mighty putty is an effective and powerful bonding epoxy stick the formula has been used successfully for over 10 years the instructions state that the product must be mixed for two minutes until it is a white color and must be allowed to fully cure for up to 24 hours when the instructions on the package are followed mighty putty is effective as advertised
3860121 i gave them a c the reason being theres a logic issue here it didnt really work on heavy objects it only worked on light objects and you dont really need the help for light objects i couldnt move a heavy chest of drawers on it at all and i tried to move my old jeep and it did not budge at all these make moving furniture on carpet easier for smaller items the moving men coasters did seem to reduce friction and make it easier for me to push or pull items into place but for really heavy things on hardwood floors i didnt get much help from the moving men and the whole point is that theyre supposed to help you move heavy things
3860122 i gave it a c the idea is that it allows you to use your computer and plug a regular phone into your computer to use the internet so it feels like youre using a regular phone overall it works ok with decent call quality with some delay and a few drop outs and its pretty easy to get it up and running the average phone bill for u s residents is 40 a month using the magic jack you pay 40 for the product plus 6 95 for shipping and handling which includes a year of free local and long distance calling to u s and canadian numbers after that its 20 a year so its technically cheaper than a landline the cons if youre the kind of person like me who doesnt want to miss a call and want them to go to voice mail you would have to pay the electricity costs to keep your computer on and that could raise your bill the 911 function is a little confusing to set up if you dont set up 911 the dispatcher wont know your address if you call it just didnt seem to measure up to what they promise

3860135 three or four years from now no mobile device vendor no matter what their market position today will be in a comfort zone

3860143 mengenalkan pada negara tidak usah yang jauh jauh dulu cukup diawali dari negara tetangga misalnya singapura atau yang sekitar asia saja juga tidak masalah
3860144 sebenarnya dikenalkan bisa lewat apa saja tetapi yang lebih bagus adalah dikenalkan melalui internet atau buku buku yang pasti dikenalkan lewat gambar lebih bagus
3860145 di umur itu anak sedang senang senangnya bermain dan ingin tahu banyak selain itu pada umur tersebut anak anak juga bisa menyerap lebih baik apa yang dipelajarinya
3860146 anak yang berpengetahuan luas akan lebih bangga kreatif dan pintar selain itu si anak juga mempunyai nilai tambah

3860155 that game right there is probably one of the most exciting games ive been in in probably shoot four or five years just the atmosphere the adrenaline every pitch matters here sometimes you get caught up in the lull of things back in the states day in and day out this really means something
3860156 to go and represent your country its a once in a lifetime opportunity
3860157 im getting older im 30 years old now to come out and do this and play here its really an experience
3860158 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3860159 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3860160 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3860161 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3860162 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3860163 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3860164 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3860165 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3860166 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3860167 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3860168 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3860169 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3860170 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3860171 the first one is live trapping followed by providing the live animals to rabbit rescue groups or to wildlife shelters the second one is live trapping followed by lethal injection which is akin to putting an animal down in a veterinary facility the third one is the use of an air rifle and the euthanized animals would be provided to wildlife shelters food its a high powered air rifle that i guess is similar to a regular one except for the fact it doesnt make the same noise
3860172 we agree with some of the groups that we would like to try to preserve as many of the animals as we can but we feel there are too many to rescue them all and have them spayed or neutered we understand that tracs has rescued up to 250 animals which is great
3860173 thats a major concern because they can cause major damage in the agricultural community thats already happened at one farm where theyve attacked the young apple trees
3860174 we are working as quickly and as safely as we can to get the unit working but first we need to investigate just what happened we are doing that at this time and as soon as we figure it out and repair whatever needs to be repaired well get that unit producing gas again
3860175 we have dedicated people working to contact alternative suppliers to get more product from elsewhere were stretching out traditional supply boundaries to get more gas in from other areas both in canada and offshore in short we know this stuff is important to people and were doing our best to minimize the situation
3860176 the laws in b c at this time the court of appeal has ruled that a motorcycle operator may wear anything on his head that could be construed as a helmet since 1987 they have not renewed the section of approved helmets because of that ruling our members of the legislature and the general public have to start speaking out
3860177 my understanding with insurance companies right now if you are involved in a motorcycle crash and are wearing one of those toy helmets they will null and void your insurance coverage for medical expenses and that includes icbc
3860178 do they realize a hospital stay can run between 1 000 and 10 000 a day if their insurance isnt going to cover their expenses
3860179 cigarettes have been determined they cost us too much with our health benefits and everything our insurance is increased because people smoke the government realizes that which is why theyve increased the tax and the cost of the things and passed legislation limiting purchase of the things i think its time the government both provincial and federal realize these helmets are starting to cost us in the same way
3860180 the motorcycle shop guy says here you want something cheap quick and legal here you go all theyre retailer doing is pushing an inferior product the bottom line for them is to sell products they dont care i can honestly say a lot of them dont care
3860181 due to unforeseen circumstances the catalytic cracking unit a key part of gasoline production at edmonton refinery had to be shut down last week
3860182 this has limited the supply of gasoline forcing petro canada to temporarily reduce the volume of gasoline delivered to customers and associates as a result customers in alberta and the interior of british columbia may notice outages of gasoline at some petro canada retail sites
3860183 wherever people congregate or there is an expectation of people being present
3860184 secondhand smoke is the number one cause of preventable health disease in america
3860185 research has shown that inhaling secondhand smoke is more harmful than actually smoking
3860186 a rational nonsmoker might actually start smoking after all according to the message its better to smoke yourself than to be exposed to secondhand smoke
3860187 move smokers and smoking away from people who do not choose to either smoke or inhale secondhand smoke
3860188 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3860189 we all know that saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3860190 the legal cases between oklahoma and arkansas evolved from a conflict over point source pollution involving municipal wastewater discharge to a conflict over nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrient runoff from poultry litter
3860191 in light of three decades or more of significant structural changes in the animal agricultural production system this shift from point source to nonpoint source mirrors the evolution of how water quality has been addressed since the enactment of clean water act
3860192 discernable confined and discrete conveyances including any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well from which pollutants may be discharged
3860193 a consequence of these structural changes is that extraordinary amounts of animal waste are produced in geographically limited areas
3860194 this waste must be disposed of or utilized somehow and a traditional and common method is for producers to apply it to the land as fertilizer
3860195 policymakers may begin to consider new policy approaches to addressing nonpoint source pollution particularly if they conclude that addressing the issue through region based litigation may not be the most effective tool to address a national issue the thought might be that perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation
3860196 shes also 22 years old i think people forget that

3860211 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions

3860224 your altitude is going up and down are you all right sir
3860225 at the time they thought of sex abuse as a moral failing and a mental illness and being a mental illness it could be treated
3860226 how are you we the legal process to put ourselves back then thats the challenge of this case
3860227 were suing the diocese because it covered up the abuse
3860228 the evidence was more than sufficient to continue the trusteeship
3860229 this was about whether or not the trusteeship was warranted and whether conditions that were alleged actually existed
3860230 were ready to go to court weve got our stuff togther were anxious to get this before an unbiased jury
3860231 my goal is to return local lodge s6 to the control of locally elected representatives just as soon as operations of the local lodge permit and it is clear that your interests are fully protected

3860234 you dont have tournaments there otherwise i would have loves to come and play in pakistan
3860235 i remember that my first ever tournament outside india was in pakistan its great place and i will definitely go there in future when the opportunity comes
3860236 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events
3860237 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3860238 the han and the ethnic minorities including the uighurs are equal members of the big family in china and they are all chinese citizens who enjoy the rights and freedoms allowed them by law

3860240 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3860241 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3860242 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3860243 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3860244 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3860245 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3860246 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3860253 right from the beginning i have always believed and also expressed the peoples republic of china the most populated nation very important so the international community should not isolate china must bring it into the mainstream of the world community
3860254 and certain principles such as democracy human rights religious freedom rule of law in these principle matters you should be firm
3860255 inflation has reached 4 5 per cent yet paramedics are being offered annual increases of 3 25 per cent
3860256 basically theyre being offered a pay cut that is something they will not accept
3860257 not one member across the state has told me they support this offer they feel theyre being forced to take industrial action to get a fair deal
3860258 paramedics we surveyed said theyve fallen asleep driving and made mistakes because of their long hours and workload
3860259 they average six hours sleep a night and often less than that
3860260 ambos simply want to make sure they can get enough sleep so theyre safe to drive and do their jobs properly it seems like a no brainer but its been rejected its bizarre

3860263 these study results suggest that many in hollywood are actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently showing it in a negative manner
3860264 throughout much of the history of broadcast television the networks adhered to a voluntary code of conduct which stipulated that respect should be maintained for the sanctity of marriage and the value of the home our report finds that not only are the boundaries no longer respected they have been obliterated
3860265 broadcasters knowing televisions ability to influence behavior must exercise greater responsibility when handling sexual situations during primetime hours opting for less graphic visual content and favoring storylines that dont celebrate promiscuity glamorize criminality or denigrate monogamy
3860266 the american people need to hold the networks and their local broadcast affiliates accountable for pushing questionable content into their homes over the publicly owned broadcast airwaves

3860270 the armed forces of the philippines and the philippine national police are conducting further clearing operations in the affected areas of north cotabato to ensure that there are no more hazards that may pose danger to lives and properties
3860271 with optimism we foresee that sooner the dispossessed residents in north cotabato will be able to return to their homes and normalcy will be restored in these areas
3860272 meanwhile addressing the concerns of the internally displaced persons ipds remains our top priority while the residents are awaiting their safe return to their homes we have started to infuse the humanitarian assistance and disaster response in coordination with the local government authorities
3860273 pnp and afp medical teams are working closely with local government units in providing assistance to displaced persons some evacuees of the cleared barangays have started coming back but only to check on their properties
3860274 about the sudden influx of returning residents because our troops have discovered a booby trap in one of the cleared barangays
3860275 there was also a foiled attempt by milf renegade forces under commander ameril umbra kato to take control of a stretch of national highway particularly midsayap kabacan highway
3860276 the pnp is also strengthening the defense system in areas not affected by the conflict to prevent incursions from repositioning renegades particularly the flanks bounded by maguindanao province and shariff kabunsuan district
3860277 while continuous clearing operations are being conducted to sanitize the entire area our hopes remain anchored on all possible peaceful solutions to every issue that led to this incident

3860280 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3860281 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3860291 i know that this is a very difficult time in their lives but i also feel a sense of betrayal about all of us who put so much of ourselves into that campaign knowing now that this was lurking in the background just a great sense of frustration and disappointment

3860297 playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia

3860301 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3860302 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3860305 hours before the georgian invasion russia had been working to secure a united nations security council statement calling for a renunciation of force by both georgia and south ossetians the statement that could have averted bloodshed was blocked by western countries
3860306 there can be little surprise therefore that russia responded to this unprovoked assault on its citizens by launching a military incursion into south ossetia
3860307 its just disappointing when a kremlin based russian station is closer to the truth than supposedly free speech cnn
3860308 ostensibly this war is about an unresolved separatist conflict yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
3860309 the invasion was clearly timed to take the russians by surprise
3860310 given the speed with which the russians responded within hours of the georgian attack the russians were expecting the georgian attack and were themselves at their jumping off points
3860311 peaceful and lasting resolution to the situation in the region
3860312 the region of south ossetia which has enjoyed de facto independence for more than 16 years
3860313 because the region is part of georgia most of those people hold russian passports go to russia and live in n ossetia its like a group of mexicans living in el paso fighting to break away from the us because they want to and start causing problems then we go an arrest the and the mexican army invades us
3860314 the plucky republic of georgia with just a few million citizens was attacked by its giant eastern neighbour russia
3860315 after the georgians opened fire following the signing of a peace agreement
3860316 we propose that shape changes may be one way nature controls protein function much like different facets can be exposed in an origami cootie catcher
3860317 it may be possible to develop targeted crowding as a precise tool to manipulate protein conformations to turn on or off specific activities and signaling cascades
3860318 i am pleased to see an experimental demonstration of the effect
3860319 what is new here is the idea that if a native protein has an elongated or nonspherical shape then molecular crowding agents can selectively stabilize various states
3860320 crowding and other environmental factors that affect protein shape may modulate protein function in cells
3860321 our motivations and ambitions of course are to continue on all three platforms
3860322 the ten year strategy is ingrained in all of us

3860326 every million units of ps2s we sell in 2008 is just a great opportunity for us to upgrade as they get closer to hd households
3860327 the hd curve is spectacular and the conversion is happening so we see that as a natural marketing campaign
3860328 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with apple and provides even greater differentiation from peers
3860329 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3860330 we believe that despite the difficult economic times market share gains and price stability are leading to positive same store sales this quarter for best buy
3860331 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3860332 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3860362 we dont guarantee lending to other forms of borrowing there is no reason why in the long run you need any guarantee of lending to the mortgage market

3860392 the msp430 remains uniquely qualified for a specific set of ultra low power applications such as small handheld meters or remote sensors weve captured in print the techniques essential for success with these applications allowing shorter development schedules reduced maintenance costs and more attractive venture capital presentations
3860393 one common assumption of many of our clients on day one is that their green application needs an ultra low power controller such as the msp430 on the other hand we think that about 80 to 90 percent of the applications weve seen throughout our work would now be better handled with modern controllers that are becoming available from other chip makers those oems with projects in the remaining ten to twenty percent need this book to stay competitive
3860394 we played a key role in the early success of the msp430 and now by shifting our focus we will help our customers get even better results in the green wave

3860408 the focus on improving act scores by the high school sbdm council and faculty has paid off
3860409 the highlands high school class of 2008 has earned the highest overall act score in the history of the school especially with the largest percentage of students taking the act
3860410 this data truly illustrates how prepared our students are for the college experience we continue to be committed to helping students reach their greatest potential
3860411 kentuckys act gains have outpaced the nations over the past five years
3860412 this is a reflection of the commitment shown by educators legislators parents and students to improving the high school experience we must continue this momentum closing achievement gaps and provide the support all students need to be successful in this critical measure

3860422 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
3860423 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
3860424 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
3860425 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
3860426 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
3860427 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
3860428 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol

3860472 because vmm has been out there for two to three years in production and ovm was only recently introduced
3860473 if mentor supports a more widely accepted de facto standard thats good for the industry if synopsys supports ovm which is a new and different implementation it will fragment things more
3860474 systemverilog package z is implemented using the greatest common divisor of our us the interoperables systemverilog language implementations

3860506 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
3860507 seventy per cent of the antibiotics administered in america end up in agriculture
3860508 the drugs are not used to cure sick animals but to prevent them from getting sick because we crowd them together under filthy circumstances these are perfect environments for disease and we also have found for reasons that i dont think we entirely understand that administering low levels of antibiotics to animals speeds their growth
3860509 believes that prudent drug use principles are essential to the control of antimicrobial resistance
3860510 antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb are found in the air and soil around farms in surface and ground water in wild animal populations and on retail meat and poultry arb are carried into the kitchen on contaminated meat and poultry where other foods are cross contaminated because of common unsafe handling practices
3860511 the problem is that we have created the perfect environment in which to breed superbugs that are antibiotic resistant
3860512 weve created a petri dish in our factory farms for the evolution of dangerous pathogens

3860563 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past
3860564 regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up

3860567 that is reserved for god or for theorists like hirsch who believe that objective knowledge can be acquired in a massive act of dispossessing ourselves of the only route to knowledge that we have the historicized self what hirschs readings of heidegger and gadamer may ultimately indicate is the traditional anglo american fear and manhandling of any sort of thought which does not work from carestian premises

3860577 much of what distinguishes writers i call romantic derives from the fact that they undertook whatever their religious creed or lack of creed to save traditional concepts schemes and values which had been based on the relation of the creator to his creature and creation but to reformulate them within the prevailing two term system of subject and object ego and non ego the human mind or consciousness and its transactions with nature

3860815 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999

3860820 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3860821 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3860822 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3860823 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases

3860834 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3860835 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3860836 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3860837 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3860838 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3860839 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3860840 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations

3860850 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3860851 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3860852 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3860853 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3860854 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3860855 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3860856 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3860857 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3860858 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3860859 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3860860 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3860861 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
3860862 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
3860863 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3860864 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3860865 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3860866 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3860867 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
3860868 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
3860869 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
3860870 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3860871 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3860872 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3860873 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3860874 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3860875 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3860876 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3860877 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3860878 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3860879 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3860880 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3860881 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can

3860886 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3860887 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3860888 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3860889 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3860890 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3860891 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3860892 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3860893 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3860894 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan
3860895 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3860896 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3860897 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3860898 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3860899 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3860900 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3860901 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3860902 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3860903 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3860904 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3860905 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3860906 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3860907 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3860908 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3860909 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3860910 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3860911 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3860912 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3860913 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3860914 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3860915 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3860916 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3860917 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3860918 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3860919 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3860920 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3860921 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3860922 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3860923 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3860924 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making

3860928 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3860929 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3860930 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3860931 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3860932 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3860933 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3860934 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3860935 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3860936 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3860937 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3860938 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3860939 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3860940 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3860941 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3860942 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3860943 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3860944 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3860945 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3860946 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3860947 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3860948 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3860949 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3860950 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3860951 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3860952 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3860953 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3860954 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3860955 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3860956 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3860957 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3860958 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3860959 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3860960 yogurt and milk products that contain active acidophilus cultures may be suggested to assist in the rejuvenation of the acidic environment
3860961 only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and i am not so sure about the former
3860962 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3860963 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3860964 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3860965 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3860966 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3860967 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3860968 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3860969 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3860970 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3860971 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3860972 just so you all know we did set a record
3860973 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3860974 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3860975 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3860976 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3860977 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3860978 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3860979 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3860980 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3860981 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3860982 sadly the name of lilias trotter is no longer remembered by many people except those 19th century art experts who recall her as the painter who caused art critic john ruskin to rhapsodically change his mind about the ability of women to be artists though all but forgotten now as an artist trotter 1853 1928 is venerated as a pioneering christian missionary she founded and funded a mission in north africa where she served for nearly 40 years
3860983 i see as clear as daylight now i cannot give myself to painting in the way he john ruskin means and continue to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness
3860984 this old leaf shall die and the new leaf shall live
3860985 every known sin shall go if there is a deliverance to be had i will have it
3860986 the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus
3860987 obama was the editor of his class harvard law review bushs daddy bought his way into yale where he graduated in history
3860988 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3860989 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3860990 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3860991 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3860992 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3860993 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3860994 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3860995 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3860996 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3860997 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3860998 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3860999 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3861000 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3861001 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3861002 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3861003 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3861004 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3861005 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3861006 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3861007 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3861008 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3861009 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3861010 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3861011 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3861012 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3861013 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3861014 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3861015 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3861016 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3861017 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3861018 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3861019 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3861020 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3861021 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3861022 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3861023 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3861024 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3861025 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3861026 my boyfriend and i took a july vacation break down in the florida keys
3861027 when frank gehrys name was first mentioned to me as a possible architect for this project the first reaction everybody had was that he builds these very unusual buildings that are not functional
3861028 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3861029 in the blink of an eye a lifetime of outrage
3861030 the older children were too busy playing video games in which people get shot stabbed bludgeoned blown up or otherwise maimed
3861031 man bathes in burger king sink then in web spotlight
3861032 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3861033 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3861034 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3861035 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3861036 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3861037 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3861038 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3861039 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3861040 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3861041 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3861042 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3861043 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3861044 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3861045 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3861046 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3861047 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3861048 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3861049 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3861050 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3861051 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3861052 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3861053 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3861054 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3861055 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3861056 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3861057 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3861058 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3861059 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3861060 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3861061 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3861062 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3861063 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3861064 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3861065 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3861066 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3861067 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3861068 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3861069 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3861070 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens

3861207 our focus is very much on launching our media net banner ad business in 4q and so there isnt much activity in the video area
3861208 advertising is moving towards the 15 second spot whether on tv online or mobile we see zero drop off when the length of the unit is extended from 10 to 15 seconds

3861312 weve taken the stance that if the u s carriers come around to it great and if they dont well be fine theres no pressure from our end
3861313 as a whole if the wrong consumer like a minor purchased adult content has been done by network operators carriers adopted a content ratings system several years ago as r rated
3861314 what carriers have done is to provide additional tools for folks who want to manage the open internet
3861315 many operators now routinely employ age verification systems although their use is by no means universal
3861316 in the u s for example operators are wary of their deployment for fear of a conservative religious outcry over the possibility that the operator might at some point in the future consider offering services that might not be suitable for minors
3861317 i gave these a b because it does what it says it will in terms of preserving your fruit and vegetables a little longer but it didnt make that much of a difference these bags kept my bananas fresh for about four to five days longer than a traditional bag and for about a week longer than no bag at all the strawberries made it three days longer in the green bags than with the plastic carton they came in after two weeks i noticed no real difference in my lettuce or tomatoes they do keep things fresher but not by such a huge margin that its worth my extra money for the bags

3861319 i ended up giving this a c because they said you could make a coffee handle so i tried that and it broke right off it did a good job in terms of connecting two irrigation pipes and it worked and prevented water seepage but it didnt give me a lot of confidence it didnt seem to be a money saver for me i used the putty to make a handle for my coffee cup but even after allowing the putty to harden completely the handle came off the cup and my mug broke
3861320 mighty putty is an effective and powerful bonding epoxy stick the formula has been used successfully for over 10 years the instructions state that the product must be mixed for two minutes until it is a white color and must be allowed to fully cure for up to 24 hours when the instructions on the package are followed mighty putty is effective as advertised
3861321 i gave them a c the reason being theres a logic issue here it didnt really work on heavy objects it only worked on light objects and you dont really need the help for light objects i couldnt move a heavy chest of drawers on it at all and i tried to move my old jeep and it did not budge at all these make moving furniture on carpet easier for smaller items the moving men coasters did seem to reduce friction and make it easier for me to push or pull items into place but for really heavy things on hardwood floors i didnt get much help from the moving men and the whole point is that theyre supposed to help you move heavy things
3861322 i gave it a c the idea is that it allows you to use your computer and plug a regular phone into your computer to use the internet so it feels like youre using a regular phone overall it works ok with decent call quality with some delay and a few drop outs and its pretty easy to get it up and running the average phone bill for u s residents is 40 a month using the magic jack you pay 40 for the product plus 6 95 for shipping and handling which includes a year of free local and long distance calling to u s and canadian numbers after that its 20 a year so its technically cheaper than a landline the cons if youre the kind of person like me who doesnt want to miss a call and want them to go to voice mail you would have to pay the electricity costs to keep your computer on and that could raise your bill the 911 function is a little confusing to set up if you dont set up 911 the dispatcher wont know your address if you call it just didnt seem to measure up to what they promise

3861337 discriminate against coursework done by high school students that includes a christian viewpoint
3861338 concluded the uc system was correct to reject courses from major book publishers including bob jones university press and a beka books a florida publishing powerhouse because they include a christian perspective
3861339 u s district judge james otero of los angeles said ucs review committees cited legitimate reasons for rejecting the texts not because they contained religious viewpoints but because they omitted important topics in science and history and failed to teach critical thinking
3861340 according to the lawsuit a variety of textbooks with supplemental perspectives were accepted just not those with a christian perspective

3861463 it is beyond my imagination that the supreme court would allow private parties to convey on federal courts a review power that congress withheld
3861464 if the procedure followed by the district court was allowed by either its local rules or state law then the faa does not purport to disallow that
3861465 10 and 11 respectively provide the federal arbitration acts exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur and modification
3861466 do they really mean that what about the various non statutory grounds that courts seem to use for overturning arbitrators awards such as manifest disregard of the law public policy arbitrary and capricious irrational

3861488 3 day prayer focus to wear new passion into the future awaken
3861489 oh no just read it take it in and pray and receive the content with how god has made you
3861490 3 day prayer focus to wear new passion into the future awaken
3861491 your life is like a mosaic in the midst of me piecing you together the enemy has inserted pieces of infirmity he has used your circumstances to fragment your soul he has tried to keep the brokenness in you so you cannot form the new picture and vision for your future
3861492 years ago i had just left a church after less than positive experiences feeling hurt by various events that had happened
3861493 during this time period late 80s early 90s the lord was using a series of conferences called catch the fire to do just that stir people up with a renewed passion for him people were excited some people were even painting their faces like braveheart ring a bell
3861494 some of my friends had already been to catch the fire meetings and really were excited about them so i decided to attend one of these conferences in dallas with a group of my houston friends
3861495 one day during a time when the spirit of the lord had fallen mightily on the huge crowd the lord showed me a picture of a very low flame and said to me that
3861496 in case you are young enough to have experienced only electric ovens let me explain about pilot lights and gas ovens
3861497 i thank god that he has put us in a body of believers for i remember how wonderful i felt after friends had laid hands and prayed for my restoration that day
3861498 so how do we restore passion when our pilot lights are low well
3861499 i feel there are even those in the body who are pilot lights that cause the rest of us to whoosh with passion and revelation those people can make a huge difference when times seem dark in my life chuck has certainly been one of those
3861500 after all we are admonished to encourage one another all the more as the day approaches and boy does it seem to be approaching
3861501 this whole time i have tried to avoid using let your little light shine in my pilot light metaphor and i almost made it but now i find myself weakening here towards the end we do need to be lights to shine in the darkness more than ever now and we do need them in good shape to shine
3861502 so ask the lord if your pilot light is low
3861503 my heart is steadfast o god i will sing and give praise awake my glory like the harp and the lute awake my glory

3861598 definitely want riley to shut down the poarch creek operation including his announcing that anyone caught gambling there cant qualify for a state contract or something like that

3861618 not all metastatic cancer is the same in some people more aggressive therapy can potentially be beneficial

3861654 saakashvili had always told us he could not stand by while georgian villages were being shelled and we always knew this was a point of pressure we always told him that he should not give in to the kind of provocations we knew the russians were capable of
3861655 i think the state department was assiduous in urging restraint and saakashvilis buddies in the white house and office of the vice president kept egging him on

3861661 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3861662 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3861663 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation

3861680 we have to be able to move a lot of the investment to the private sector
3861681 our biggest way of improving security is to make sure that young people are employed
3861682 it brings the whole u n organization together in partnership with iraq and its people to reduce poverty foster growth and consolidate democracy in our country
3861683 had this been a year ago you would have seen retribution attacks
3861684 instead of spiraling down into violence the iraqi people have rejected the violence
3861685 i am feeling a sort of peace for the first time since my arrest 15 years ago i am now slowly realising that i have a future after all and that is a great feeling
3861686 i am quite satisfied that this amounts to misconduct in the investigation and prosecution of this case and i categorise it egregious
3861687 this is an offer that has been made and that offer has been accepted naturally colin is relieved and it will go some way to compensating him for the vilification that he has received at the hands of the public and media for the last 16 years
3861688 it will allow him to try and rebuild his life and to have some sort of normal existence but of course what he really wanted was an apology from the metropolitan police and i think he has accepted that is something he will never get
3861689 he is not angry he is hurt and disappointed he is gradually getting his life back on track and this will act as a catalyst

3861695 in a study published in the july 2008 issue of geophysical research letters drs david s nolan and eric d rappin from the university of miamis rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science describe a new method for evaluating the frequency of hurricane formation in present and future tropical climates
3861696 while current thinking about changes in hurricane frequency comes mostly from computer simulations of global climate the computer models used for these studies can only represent the coarsest features of hurricanes thus casting doubt in their predictions of hurricane activity
3861697 the new approach by nolan and rappin developed in collaboration with dr
3861698 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3861699 instead we got exactly the opposite result emphasis ours as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater

3861714 we were able to work on several things defensively that we havent had a chance to in our first two games
3861715 we continue to stress our defense and really working hard on that end of the floor once again forcing the number of turnovers that we do makes us happy as a team so it was a good win for us and were thinking about spain from this point forward
3861716 it was good we just wanted to get the win we wanted to come out and perform well and not have a drop off it was a little tough for us but i thought we really pulled together and again hung our hats on our defense defense and rebounding is key and thats what really i try to focus on
3861717 were building for the medal round so we definitely want to stay on top of our game
3861718 mali is a very athletic team but kind of inexperienced with competition of this magnitude we wanted to come out and just be ourselves we got a slow start but we continued to get better as time passed

3861869 the first funkyou site was a project started by okapi studio around 2004 and like many of those reading this right now we were watching and posting on that site everybody thought it was a cool project but then towards the end of 2005 it all stopped and sometime after that the domain registration for funkyou ro expired
3861870 the u s geological survey confirmed last month what the oil industry had long suspected when the agency released an estimate that the area north of the arctic circle may hold as much as 90 billion barrels of oil and 1 669 trillion cubic feet of natural gas or roughly 13 percent of the worlds total undiscovered oil and 30 percent of the undiscovered natural gas

3861872 the u n stands ready to facilitate international discussions as well as to contribute to possible peacekeeping or other arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia
3861873 the resolution of the conflicts in georgia requires a comprehensive approach through a concerted effort by the international community
3861874 a solution based on the full respect of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
3861875 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3861876 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3861877 but theres also been areas of strain and this certainly is one of them
3861878 try to make sure he doesnt do anything on his part to make matters worse

3861882 these are regular russian troops they go into houses they destroy houses there is all this documentary footage around that can prove it they are taking things like furniture toilet seats killing people terrorizing people
3861883 it western reaction has not been adequate theyre talking about a negotiated ceasefire how this side should do this this side should do that its appeasement
3861884 appeasement in 1938 brought tens of millions of deaths to europe
3861885 im sickened sickened of this cynical and absolutely unfounded allegation
3861886 what we are seeing is classical balkan type and world war two type of ethnic cleansing
3861887 that is called schizophrenia and what can you say to a schizophrenic
3861888 there is a different question of who there is to talk to when its clear that he is a sick man
3861889 when you really look at some of saakashvilis interviews given to television channels in the west do you think he is really winning the information war
3861890 he looked how should i say it somewhat stressed in those interviews i am not sure he really came across that well
3861891 theyve tried to cut off energy lines using their iskander missiles against pipelines cnn qualifies them as missiles of mass destruction
3861892 they also want to punish our democracy and thats where we find ourselves now
3861893 if indeed russia is violating a ceasefire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which russia is moving
3861894 i really do believe that the russians understand that pushing the envelope here would have significant consequences for russias standing in the international system
3861895 hey everyone come and join brydge entertainment as we co host with i e t entertainment and others 4play thursdays ultrabar in washington dc this is the college sendoff edition this is the place to be on thursdays
3861896 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer
3861897 happy birthday to you you live in a zoo you look like a money and you smell like one too
3861898 damn queen blackie chan there got himself a big ol man meat between his legs flopping around

3861900 if you just look at the last five years of data the amount of drift ice is decreasing
3861901 if this continues we are going to be in trouble ten years from now perhaps we need to think about a different kind of business
3861902 military and avionics systems such as mission computers navigation and guidance systems and stores management systems often have limited or no forced cooling requiring electronics with minimal heat dissipation and very low power consumption
3861903 our high density military temperature proasic3 and proasic3el devices give designers the increased logic they need for their sophisticated military and aerospace applications the combination of low power and high reliability provides an extremely desirable solution for these systems
3861904 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worth it or not
3861905 what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay the u n is back to have its footprint increasing its activities increasing

3861908 which is a better web portal system net nuke or microsoft sharepoint or rainbow
3861909 the first game of the season is always very important especially as we are playing against chelsea
3861910 if we can pull something out of the game then the confidence will be very high and we will be able to believe in ourselves that we can do more
3861911 its good that the manager has options upfront if you are playing in four competitions then you need to have a lot of strikers to pick from for every match
3861912 all is signed approved and sealed he has signed for a new two year deal which is basically an extension from the previous contract that he had with the club the contract has been revised and improved which has left both the player and the club extremely happy
3861913 i am happy that he will continue with the club in the psl having played in the psl before jermaine will certainly bring some experience to the team he is a utility player that will give the coach options
3861914 im extremely pleased that we have managed to keep the game at its original venue and its definitely a victory for the clubs the league and the soccer in the country
3861915 i would like to give my endless thanks to the people that have showed first class professionalism by listening to new input and our explanations and then changing their resolution
3861916 we need to make some adjustments before 2010 podcast feed
3861917 question of the day do we want a convertible murano
3861918 one advantage of private ownership is that we can sell nonearning assets to generate cash
3861919 the shape of the letter tau presented a resemblance to the figure of the cross and that therein was contained a prophesy of the sign which is made by christians upon their foreheads for all the faithful make this sign in commencing any undertaking and especially at the beginning of prayer or of reading holy scripture
3861920 its like driving by a house and you see the fa ade of the house but in reality you could actually go inside and start opening some of the drawers and closets and see things
3861921 its a whole other level of experience another world there and so what im trying to do is sort of open some of the doors up there
3861922 i guess what im most interested in with photography is this question of bringing seemingly disparate elements into an image because theres so much of that in life and i think were all sort of taught to compartmentalize things
3861923 i like to think of new jersey as not just a place like princeton which is so privileged and pretty for the most part but i want to get out of these kind of socioeconomic geographic boxes and experience the diversity of things
3861924 then also put that into the photography if i can that juxtaposition of things that normally we kind of segregate one from the other
3861925 ive spent so much time doing other stuff to make money because i wasnt confident i could make money doing just writing or photography i always got into these other things basically corporate communications and some teaching but mostly on the corporate level
3861926 and theyre not disconnected from what i like but theyre not the real thing
3861927 its that kind of juxtaposition in this case of poverty and wealth or quote beauty and non beauty
3861928 to me digital is great for a lot of the obvious reasons you get to see the results right away you can do so much with the image when you get it to your computer and also you dont have a darkroom
3861929 which isnt to say that editing a photograph digitally is necessarily easy but you dont have chemicals and you dont have that whole labor intensive process of the darkroom
3861930 in fact if you look hard enough i think you can always find things worth photographing
3861931 i think if you never went more than 100 feet from your house you could probably make some wonderful photographs within 100 feet of wherever you are for a year
3861932 if you look and are imaginative enough then you hit it right
3861933 in short we can provide them with a widely available accurate operational picture when they need it where they need it
3861934 our workplace safety expertise from multiple disciplines allows us to support the u s navy from the initial issue examination through project completion

3861936 i must say it again i am very excited about the call up and look forward to my first training session with the team
3861937 he is one of the best right backs in the country but has been affected by injuries especially last season allie has great potential in football and i think his call up is long overdue
3861938 we got an automatic green light to go through mexican customs and then we were blindfolded and taken to a house in tijuana they held a pistol to my stomach all the time we were in the car

3861948 a study conducted during the 2006 elections showed that text message reminders helped increase turnout among new voters by four percentage points at a cost of only 1 56 per vote much cheaper than the 20 or 30 per vote that the offline work of door to door canvassing or phone banking costs
3861949 novels in three lines is a collection of more than a thousand anonymously published blurbs that appeared in the french newspaper le matin in 1906 they were all penned by f lix f n on who worked as a clerk in the french war department
3861950 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3861951 app store shoppers should get to make the choice of whether or not to buy an iphone app not apple particularly since the app store is the only way to legitimately purchase consumer iphone apps
3861952 imagine if apple chose which music they stocked in the itunes store based on the companys taste no kanye because jay z is better no dylan because its too whiney of course they dont do that they stock a crapload of different music and let the buyer decide we should deride apple for that type of behavior not cheer them on
3861953 the worlds biggest maker of athletic shoes rose in new york stock exchange trading during each of the six summer games going back to 1984 gaining an average of 8 7 percent in the two week period from the opening to the closing ceremonies

3861962 choosing to get tattooed transforms you sometimes innocuously sometimes with profound significance
3861963 people who get tattoos are looking for a deeper layer of meaning
3861964 we took two days off in nashville and were going to fly in this morning
3861965 its five and a half hours our friend is documenting the tour so hes filming this part of it too i hope it makes it onto the dvd its pretty unbelievable
3861966 it gets harder sometimes but its really cool because all of our friends are with us on tour
3861967 its four best friends on tour playing music all the time its a little easier for me having my brother with me its always pretty relaxed and we all stay pretty chill
3861968 we always thought it would be random but fun to play some shows together he had two dates that no one was playing so it worked out with us he took us out to dinner once which was pretty unbelievable
3861969 we have no idea hayley will say things on stage and in interviews that she has no idea about
3861970 the whole next summer thing we havent talked about when were going to record the record it may be sooner it may be later we have some ideas that we practice in sound check but nothings been recorded well probably start demoing after this tour and then start the whole process nothing until then
3861971 u s driving slid for the eighth straight month in june making the decline more pronounced that the drop that occurred during the 1970s oil shock the u s department of transportation said americans drove 12 2 billion miles less in june than a year earlier with that the decline since november is now 53 2 billion miles topping the 49 3 billion decline three decades ago rural travel has fallen 4 since late last year while urban driving is off just 1 2 see the federal highway administration data
3861972 obama also allowed hillary supporters to insert an absurd statement into the platform suggesting that media sexism spurred her loss and that demeaning portrayals of women dampen the dreams of our daughters this even though postmortems including the new raft of campaign memos leaked by clintonistas to the atlantic another move that undercuts obama finger hillarys horrendous management skills
3861973 those hopes had been severely dented in the third minute when u s defender michael orozco was ejected by germany referee wolfgang starg for throwing an elbow into a nigerian players midriff the foul occurred at midfield and came in retaliation to orozco being held it caused nowaks side to play short handed for 87 minutes plus stoppage time which proved too great a wall to climb
3861974 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3861975 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3861976 hey man go get me a pack of newport lights from the store

3861983 touch sight is a revolutionary digital camera designed for visually impaired people simple features make it easy to use including a unique feature which records sound for three seconds after pressing the shutter button the user can then use the sound as reference when reviewing and managing the photos touch sight does not have an lcd but instead has a lightweight flexible braille display sheet which displays a 3d image by embossing the surface allowing the user to touch their photo the sound file and picture document combine to become a touchable photo that is saved in the device and can be uploaded to share with others and downloaded to other touch sight cameras
3861984 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3861985 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3861986 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3861987 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3861988 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3861989 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3861990 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3861991 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3861992 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3861993 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3861994 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3861995 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3861996 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3861997 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3861998 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3861999 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3862000 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3862001 who are open to doing something on the production side
3862002 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3862003 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3862004 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3862005 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3862006 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3862007 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3862008 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3862009 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3862010 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3862011 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3862012 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3862013 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3862014 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3862015 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3862016 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3862017 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3862018 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3862019 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3862020 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3862021 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3862022 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3862023 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3862024 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3862025 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3862026 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3862027 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3862028 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3862029 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3862030 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3862031 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3862032 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3862033 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3862034 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3862035 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3862036 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3862037 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3862038 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3862039 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3862040 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3862041 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3862042 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3862043 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3862044 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3862045 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3862046 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3862047 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3862048 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3862049 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3862050 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3862051 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3862052 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3862053 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3862054 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3862055 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3862056 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3862057 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3862058 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3862059 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3862060 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3862061 jeremy postadvertising com has sent you a story from internationaltrucks com
3862062 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3862063 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3862064 irreparably harmed by senator mccains illegal and illegitimate presence on the ballot

3862067 vi kan ikke tillade os at tage let p ligaopg rerne bare fordi vi har en europ isk kamp om en uge eller m ned i strig slovenien og rusland er der stor forskel p top og bund i deres ligaer derfor kan de tillade sig at t nke en m ned frem mod en europ isk kamp det er ogs en af grundene til at de pr sterer s godt i europa

3862072 at a morning manhattan fundraiser a smiling clinton with presumptive democratic presidential nominee obama at her side indicated the two are as in step with each other as the dancing team of ginger rogers and fred astaire but given the former rivals raw and recent past of ravaging each other on the campaign trail it may take more than a tango to keep their passionately partisan supporters in tandem according to political observers conflict resolution experts and family therapists

3862077 these waste pickers are providing a public service for free
3862078 we had managed to stop half a dozen of these dubious projects in the past
3862079 but this time around in the name of carbon credits fraudulent claims are being made with impunity
3862080 it tends to be too wet containing too much ash and sand and noncombustible inert materials
3862081 i know what happens to incinerator ash most of it ends up by the side of the road there are no engineered landfills in india fly ash and bottom ash is required to be managed very carefully in most countries but in india they simply do not have the infrastructure to do that
3862082 when waste pickers are denied access to the waste stream they go through the ash looking for metal the only substance to survive incineration intact
3862083 ive seen people thigh deep picking through incinerator ash for metals youre using the human body as a toxic basically spoon feeding it to these people
3862084 every night backstage at some rock and roll concert pornos are being made even though they will never be distributed at least not professionally and all the local girls become porn stars
3862085 it always seemed like one is the hand and the other is the glove and are related by blood sweat and tears and drugs dirty sleazy greasy and a whole lot of fun why it was never exploited prior to me is difficult to believe
3862086 when we interviewed lemmy at his apartment it was covered in nazi memorabilia it was hard to shoot because there were swastikas everywhere
3862087 theres a lot of interesting little stories like that one as far as freaky stuff is concerned there was plenty of lunch meat tossing and other various weird things such as the toilet paper beer mummy but nothing that would shock avn readers the peanut butter and jelly boob sandwiches were kind of bizarre
3862088 in the early days of my career everyone was very into it because thats what i was the porn rocker
3862089 vh1 and mtv didnt help i was plastered on those channels weekly being promoted as some type of rocker flesh god the fans i had were chicks with rock cock fantasies and guys that wanted to get my leftovers so it all worked later when i came back to porn metal fans seemed much more reluctant because porn is not as cool as some would have you believe
3862090 there were moments of pure evil genius within club satan
3862091 it will go down as a cult classic as much as i would love to take all the credit my brother mark zane had a huge part in shooting it and without the editor hart fisher it would never have come out looking the way it did hart was essential in making it all come together the fact that it was even made makes the whole project a success to me there has never been anything like that and i dont think there will be anything similar for a while you thought it was sick you should see the euro version so it didnt sell as much as i would have hoped the press and interest was there but getting that movie placed in stores was next to impossible
3862092 i shifted gears because i didnt really have a choice
3862093 no one will shoot projects like extreme did when i was contacted by evolution erotica they asked for alt stuff and they were going to pay the bills doesnt mean i couldnt be creative it just meant i had to go more mainstream i think that i still pushed the norm and created some unique projects since i have been with them i have done some very interesting work porn stars getting real tattoos and having sex at the same time thats never been done guys performing real stunts to get laid jackass style thats new metal porn that has music vids and exclusive interviews with name music acts no one is doing that i may be in a different gear but its still creative and unique
3862094 someone very close to angel contacted me and basically said to stop making noise about criss and the suspension because he will never acknowledge that i broke his record
3862095 anyone mentioning my suspension or even asking questions was banned from his message board and myspace he and his people did everything they could to just sweep it under the rug they did a great job it was in their best interest i took the one thing criss does that is actually real and destroyed it now he just has tricks
3862096 he has influenced everyone from me to criss angel i would have never suspended if it wasnt for him unfortunately he doesnt get as much credit as he deserves
3862097 i think the only similarity between us is that we both use tattooed girls with a bit of an edge to their look the fact that i was doing that 10 years ago and introducing the idea of relevant music and slicker editing is probably why some people think i am the godfather of alt porn in that case i am also the forerunner of punk porn or any type of porn that utilizes things i was trying to introduce to adult films in the 90s sometimes successfully and sometimes not so with that being said eon has taken his filmmaking to an entirely different level i am not even sure if his movies count as porn to tell you the truth if anyone in this business has the potential to really cross over into the indie film scene he is the guy i look at his films more like moving art pieces i think the difference between crowds is simple one is arty and one is metal i see his movies being talked about at a runway fashion show i see mine being talked about at a mixed martial arts event
3862098 i love his guitar playing i am a huge fan of janes addiction saw them way back in the day i still listen to those records dave says he is a fan of mine he could be saying that because its the proper thing to do in show business or he could mean it i dont know either way i have great respect for him as an artist and think he is a very cool guy he has supported my career more than anyone in the adult biz every time i see him i cant thank him enough for all the opportunities he has given me to get my projects out there great
3862099 me and her are husband and wife in a very human story and shes pulls it down shes does a great job

3862110 when obama says we have to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in thats the line thats a signal that says hes not yanking troops out right away

3862118 the america they founded should never imprison people for years without charge or hearing
3862119 the america they founded should never ship prisoners to foreign lands knowing their new jailers might torture them
3862120 such abuses once were committed by the arrogant crowns of europe spawning rebellion
3862121 today our nation does such things in the name of our safety petrified unwilling to take the risks that love of liberty demands we close our eyes

3862188 is there a way to calculate savings and are they predictable for how long will it lead to savings how long will it take to reduce the peak demand and save energy

3862216 they can do whatever they want to do but they cannot keep it
3862217 if thats not acceptable then the central government should send its forces to kirkuk to protect us
3862218 or the kurds should increase the number of turkmen serving in kirkuks security forces or someone should bring in international troops because we no longer trust the kurds or the americans who back them

3862264 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
3862265 adolescents are faced with so many influences that contribute to smoking attitudes and behaviors to find that a simple household rule that bans smoking in the home has a meaningful impact on smoking attitudes and behaviors is somewhat surprising
3862266 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
3862267 these bans send a strong message to teens that its not okay to smoke and in the face of so many other external factors that may influence teens to smoke peers advertising a home smoking policy is one thing that parents can control to some extent
3862268 this study is important because it brings attention to certain vulnerable groups who are currently underserved specifically ex combatants who make up 30 percent of 3 2 million people

3862304 at the time that i started this i had already been doing research on the treatment of severe burn survivors for no real reason other than i found the medical aspects of it fascinating
3862305 id been carrying around a story idea for many years about how could i start a relationship with that feeling and these things all came together and i thought id take it to the most literal level where theres an actual burn
3862306 youre thinking ok this is the next journey this is the next thing that im going to learn about
3862307 whether i have a publishing deal or dont have a publishing deal my life was going down a good path anyway i was already happy
3862308 in a sentence i can sum it up theyre good people and i was well loved
3862309 but they were proud of me before the great story to sell would be this instant success where it turns my life around but before this i think they were always just happy that i was living a life that i enjoyed
3862310 i have an idea about what im doing for the next book and ive got hundreds of pages of notes already taken
3862311 but that really doesnt mean that i have any idea about what its going to be about at this point
3862312 i want to live a happy life with lots of interesting experiences
3862313 the work that a person leaves behind thats not their life and i am paraphrasing leonard cohen here but he talks about that being the evidence of a life if life burns properly its the ashes left behind
3862314 and i love doing the work and it is a big part of who i am but it is not thats not it it is the totality
3862315 i hope that you cant sum up my life with he wrote books
3862316 its not just music for the united states its world music

3862320 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
3862321 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
3862322 with my fan base being broader and larger now im looking to somewhere where somebody can really take advantage of that and take it to the next level

3862326 linguist himself acting as producer and proliferator of the data of his work
3862327 when analyzing his own intuitions the introspective linguist treats as distant and strange something which is quite familiar to him
3862328 for the philologist the achievement of this task is not generally an aim in itself but rather a resort for understanding the contents of the data written in the language in question
3862329 speech acts typically have a speaker and a hearer who share a common situation namely the speech or speech act situation
3862330 the propositional and illocutionary qualities of a speech act have to be transferred to a time different from that of its utterance
3862331 a secondary hearer reader of texts which were handed over to him by chance
3862332 all of those speech situation factors which warrant their actual comprehension
3862333 forming a mental representation of the language within his own mind
3862334 he himself is the only one who can really speak the language i e who develops a concrete individualized competence in that language a competence comprising all of the elements that make a language this secondary competence of the philologist is open to introspection and introspection is the main way how the philologist comes to systematic results on the structures of his subject
3862335 make accessible the foreign world of native speakers who are not available for inquiry or direct questioning
3862336 he applies in a radicalized fashion field methods which are normally used to elicit the nnss linguistic knowledge and to occasion his utterances
3862337 rudimentary intuition about the language represented in the texts by increasing his own competence of the dead language he can support his empirical approach with increasingly pertinent and accurate structural material the empirical approach contributes to the elaboration of his competence of the language
3862338 the movement from comprehensibility or understandability of the text to its comprehension and understanding is the movement of building up a linguistic knowledge which for purpose of analysis can be approached by introspection and of changing previous stages of this knowledge by reconfronting it with the texts to which the knowledge refers
3862339 i think we will be more focused on our own independence
3862340 elliotts view of structural separation is well known and well documented but we are not elliotts seats on the board

3862352 scott adapted a book i wrote into a presentation he did a fantastic job he took subject matter that some might call boring and made it fresh and exciting he is an expert at visual storytelling and i recommend him highly

3862383 silly questions you know that i am master of the secrets i tell no one anything
3862384 twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder where youre at

3862388 may they blush for shame therefore those envious people beyond the mountains who claim to have some part of it or possess relics of it
3862389 it was about three feet long a foot deep and a foot wide and it contained a quantity of very old bones the party was overwhelmed by emotion one workman fainted and remained blind for half an hour after he had recovered consciousness the clerk of the works was sent to tell the archbishop though the time was 2am and woke up the place by throwing stones at the coachmans window

3862395 if it became a regular occurrence like it is with conventional beef i think wed be extremely concerned
3862396 is times like these that i have most often misplaced my homemaking vision and what happens is discontentment sets in hurriedness becomes the norm confusion circles around me and if let go unchecked resentment will hush in like a fog or shroud

3862398 chinas leaders know that the development of green buildings is a critical need and the olympic village can serve as a model for this development

3862418 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3862419 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3862420 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
3862421 i want to feel like i am doing something that matters in peoples lives
3862422 working on this case and with our 67 plaintiffs has been an amazing experience and i hope that we are able to correct the injustice that they have suffered for so many years

3862424 russia purely just dropped the bomb to try to kill people and cause mayhem
3862425 we expected to take injured from tskhinvali or senaki not our own
3862426 we have credible reports of villages being burned of shootings of killings of innocent people and civilians
3862427 we heard sirens and shooting and hurried to leave the area
3862428 outside gori there were people on the road looking for cars to take them away
3862429 a proportionate response to an unprovoked assault on it citizens
3862430 no intention of annexing or occupying any part of georgia
3862431 over the next few days on the condition that georgia refrains from military activity and keeps its forces out of the region russia will continue to take the diplomatic steps required to consolidate this temporary cessation to hostilities
3862432 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by

3862437 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
3862438 they will most likely be small fuel efficient and inexpensive
3862439 we are eager to begin exporting small cars from china as soon as possible that will attract new customers in two segments in which our brands are underrepresented very young buyers and entry level buyers

3862446 this is a more effective way of operating the brands and will help remove duplication
3862447 it is important to give those in control sufficient weight to override those who make the money the fact that issues were identified at credit suisse and not followed up the fsa will have found to be very very significant
3862448 in august september 2007 some significant price testing variances were identified but although questions were asked the explanations given by certain traders were not adequately challenged
3862449 certain traders were able to continue pricing certain positions higher than market indices despite requests to the contrary
3862450 what would you do if you had the chance to change someones world would you
3862451 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3862452 weve got a good sized rally but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3862453 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there
3862454 i dont think people are going to change their commuting habits that fast
3862455 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction

3862457 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3862458 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride

3862468 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3862469 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3862470 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital and get away with it
3862471 its time to stop this so that russia can dig out of the hole its gotten itself into
3862472 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe

3862489 even if new 3g entrants join 2g spectrum queue everyone knows there is no spectrum so why should they pay government rs 1 651 crore for just a licence they would be wiser to buy into a company like us which has assured spectrum

3862496 wi fi helps make the internet more accessible to people
3862497 once you get to the internet then you can go look at your e mail you can go to websites you can pretty much do anything
3862498 certainly on the consumer side theres terrific growth because people have reached the point where they are familiar with wi fi they have it on their laptops and connect when they are travelling
3862499 voice over wi fi is still a cutting edge technology
3862500 people in the future will have more and more devices that are wi fi enabled
3862501 one of the earliest municipalities to embrace it and develop it was fredericton in new brunswick
3862502 it was sold as we will put it in and it will be free
3862503 but if you put together some wi fi hot spots at the corner coffee shop that doesnt mean you can do the network for a whole metropolitan area wi fi was never designed to cover a big urban area

3862511 i contacted most of the players and we know the prize money will be at least 2 000 and the winner of this tournament will automatically qualify for the tft tournament in october so it was not that hard to get them to participate in this roc tournament but many players refused
3862512 i have wanted to host this kind of tournament for a while to remember the old times and if this tournament goes well perhaps i will organise another

3862526 coach smith genoot ook daar veel aanzien alleen sprak hij geen spaans ik wel dus heeft hij de leiding van het kamp toen maar aan mij overgelaten

3862548 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
3862549 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
3862550 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
3862551 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
3862552 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
3862553 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
3862554 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
3862555 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them

3862571 hosu bistro is actually the only korean place ill go in toronto
3862572 i used to eat there every wednesday at lunch and earlier today when i went was informed that its off the menu which is strange since harveys and swiss chalet are the same company and harveys still has their veggie burger what a bummer
3862573 there is a tofu option and its actually great so you can get those burritos with tofu and substitute guacamole for cheese or sour cream they are really delicious
3862574 white and yellow berries are poisonous 90 of the time blue and black berries are good to eat 90 of the time however deadly nightshade berries see photo to the right are dark blue or black and they taste sweet but a couple can kill you fairly quickly and red berries are a 50 50 shot aggregate berries bumpy ones like raspberries strawberries etc are almost 100 good to eat the only exception to that rule is a white berry that grows only in alaska
3862575 there are no poisonous look alikes since no poisonous berry has a crown
3862576 we hear a great deal about how we should buy food locally as a way of reducing
3862577 strengthen citizen support for responsible foreign policy throughout the country

3862587 rumors are circulating that beazer is the target of a buyout offer
3862588 russia must be made to realise that its actions have seriously damaged its reputation
3862589 as part of the rehabilitation of the region any future peacekeeping force in abkhazia and south ossetia must be independent and not based on russian forces
3862590 it would be utterly unacceptable for russia to try and destabilise a democratically elected government on its border with a view to any sort of regime change
3862591 the international community would view that extraordinarily dimly and would have diplomatic consequences for russia
3862592 an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces
3862593 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3862594 this report is rubbish from start to finish it certainly wont become conservative policy
3862595 conservative policy is focused on the good work of continuing the regeneration resurgence of cities right across england including in the north of england
3862596 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3862597 but the issue is clear internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3862598 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3862599 i think the idea that cities cannot regenerate themselves is just nonsense and i think that people should see this report in that way
3862600 it is difficult to find anything sensible in this report
3862601 mass migration from north to south is the last thing struggling areas need it would widen rather than narrow the gap between north and south
3862602 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people
3862603 freedom responsibility and accountability are the keys to unlocking the potential that exists in our towns and cities
3862604 this is not going to happen that i was exaggerating
3862605 una caricatura que no ha hecho nada en la vida
3862606 we were able to accomplish this level of internal improvement despite the softness in the u s economy and the sharp rise in commodity prices
3862607 during the quarter we also saw greater demand for our greenhouse grown produce due to recent food safety concerns regarding certain domestic and imported tomatoes
3862608 once you get to the internet then you can go look at your e mail you can go to websites you can pretty much do anything
3862609 certainly on the consumer side theres terrific growth because people have reached the point where they are familiar with wi fi they have it on their laptops and connect when they are travelling
3862610 voice over wi fi is still a cutting edge technology
3862611 people in the future will have more and more devices that are wi fi enabled
3862612 we have taken decisive actions to align our infrastructure and improve operating efficiencies across the company
3862613 although a more meaningful contribution will come once all initiatives are implemented
3862614 management miscalculated amds capability to produce competitive parts in volume and as a result lost significant gross profit dollars and market share
3862615 we believe that much of the bad news is understood and are hopeful that expectations and estimates will be largely reset across the board
3862616 some things we cant control but there are many things we can weve dusted ourselves off and we are now intensely focused on change changes and improvements that will enhance our performance in the future
3862617 it was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression

3862626 before rush limbaugh there was nothing like talk radio hes been to talk what elvis was to rock n roll he saved the am dial limbaugh is a master of the airwaves he is the best talent on the air in modern broadcasting
3862627 broadcasters of rushs quality come along once in a lifetime were privileged to continue our relationship with limbaugh which is unprecedented in the history of our industry
3862628 we are honored to present this award to a pioneer of the emerging alternative media in recognition of his invaluable contributions to conservative ideals its only fitting that rush limbaugh be the first recipient of this annual award
3862629 rush limbaugh is a patriot in every way his agenda is america the same spirit throughout his career rush has also tried to shape public opinion he has challenged us to think and uphold the principles on which this country was founded he has advanced the cause of freedom and has promoted the welfare of his fellow man in a most compelling manner rush limbaugh has blazed a trail for others to follow and they have followed
3862630 rush is just an amazing radio performer years ago i used to listen in the car on my way to reporting gigs and id notice that i disagreed with everything he was saying yet i not only wanted to keep listening i actually liked him that is some chops you can count on two hands the number of public figures in america who can pull that trick off
3862631 i hired a lot of people over the years fancy kids from elite schools and i always asked how did you become a conservative
3862632 hes a leader if rush engages on an issue it gives others courage to engage
3862633 i despise his ideology but rush is a lot smarter and craftier than don imus limbaugh puts things in a way that he cant be blamed for easy bigotry some of the songs he does about me just make me laugh but hes the most dangerous guy we have to deal with on the right including oreilly and imus they come at you with an ax he uses a razor
3862634 the rush limbaugh show enjoys an unprecedented platform of radio affiliates plus advertisers harness the intensity of listener engagement no ones word of mouth about a product or service delivers more impact than mr limbaughs
3862635 when the history of these times is written those who do so will reflect that in all of broadcast journalism no one has had a greater influence in returning america to her traditional roots than rush limbaugh ever faithful and steadfast to his views of small government maximum individual liberty a strong national defense and traditional social values rush limbaugh has challenged educated enlightened and moved millions in ways that presidents prime ministers and potentates can only envy he is the gold standard of fidelity to conservative principles happy anniversary my friend
3862636 i remember the first time i heard my father mention this guy he heard on the radio named rush limbaugh it must have been in the early 1990s
3862637 the initial investigation indicates the child was shot by another child in the home
3862638 a 10 year old boy found his mothers gun and shot the girl who is his niece a 2 year old girl also was present at the time of the shooting
3862639 the integration of quovas powerful geolocation service into the brightcove platform has provided our customers with unparalleled choice and control over their online video distribution strategies
3862640 when japans television broadcasters chose brightcove for their exclusive online video portal for the beijing games quova proved to be an invaluable partner enabling our customers in japan to meet very strict geographic requirements and launch a successful advertising supported web property
3862641 quovas professional expertise and consulting services were of tremendous value to both rainet and labone quova proved capable of delivering the absolute accuracy and quality we needed and implemented the necessary technology in the few weeks we had available
3862642 broadcasting is one of the many industries that have become very tightly regulated as the internet has blossomed over the last ten years
3862643 by using quova data to significantly increase visibility of a customers location broadcasters open up an entirely new channel of delivery but this can only be achieved while staying within the guidelines provided by content rights holders as more of our customers enter rights management negotiations we have seen an increase in requests for ip data that can meet the accuracy and availability that is being demanded of them the summer games in beijing represent a massive opportunity for our customers and were proud to be an important part of their solution

3862652 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3862653 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3862654 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
3862655 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3862656 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3862657 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
3862658 the scary city doesnt use the platform but incorporates it into how the stories develop
3862659 my goal with the scary city is to redefine arg and interactivity how people communicate interact and relate with one another online the scary city will provide the world with the ultimate entertainment regardless to the age religion language culture and race

3862663 this is being done by an expert team which includes some of the most respected creative talent in the world who really know how to tell a story on the internet and weve designed a highly sophisticated plan both financially and artistically to create a worldwide phenomenon
3862664 the promise of the internet is how it allows us to mix reality with fantasy
3862665 a hundred years ago it was said that reality imitates art but now we can say reality truly co exists with art
3862666 every race you see here theres a surprise or something that you didnt expect thats the big warning the caveat

3862669 troy university has always been interested in providing opportunities for young people to better themselves and this is a situation where a young man who has made some mistakes is looking for a second chance
3862670 i have met with josh and i am convinced that he is ready and willing to do the things we need for him to do to be a productive member of both this football team and the troy university community
3862671 extending asjha to a long term contract makes good business sense
3862672 keeping asjha here was a top priority for us and we are very pleased with this new contract
3862673 im in a competition all the time everybodys in a competition who here is not in a competition right now if youre denying youre lying

3862677 id like to see more of it it depends on how successful it is
3862678 we brought out the four linebackers out there moving around see the quarterback a little confused pointing at this guy that guy if we continue to grow with that scheme well bring more of it and more of it
3862679 why not the tools are in place its a matter of going out there and doing it
3862680 right now its a matter of training and getting ourselves honed in on being our best whether that means were no 1 in the nfl i dont know but the potentials there it can be something we can do
3862681 this is the best ive ever felt in my life
3862682 a year ago both my knees it was bad now that i had two surgeries it was a gray area but im just glad im back right now

3862684 any time you can add a defender with experience at a high level it is a positive
3862685 cory is a solid player and can play both centrally and wide on the backline and will add leadership to the team

3862694 plaintiff appeared at groves municipal court on dec 11 2007 and explained to the city prosecutor that he was not the person stopped for theft at defendants store and the cases were reset for a jury trial on feb 27 2008
3862695 after viewing its own security tape on its own computer in the store where the tape was originally recorded back on aug 14 2007 the store manager admitted that the person in the tape was not plaintiff
3862696 throughout the prosecution of the theft charge against plaintiff defendants had in their possession video tape that could establish that plaintiff was not the person that attempted to steal beefsteaks from defendant but acted with conscious indifference even after plaintiff informed them of their mistake and attempted to get them to dismiss the charges

3862707 so its nice to be doing the opposite for once
3862708 any time you get to play a donald ross course its a treat
3862709 so hopefully word will spread to the players that this is a great golf course a fun place to play and it will help the tournament out thats no 1 helping the tournament out
3862710 i would be here because i thought it was a good year to support the event when they were changing venues and they needed that support
3862711 its not very long so you dont really need to hit drivers every hole its a tight enough golf course where you can enjoy it as well it requires attention and theres a lot of tricky holes out there its got a lot of variety
3862712 we have a luxury in that we dont have to play players 35 minutes a night to get wins
3862713 we have 12 players who can all go out and work and hustle and score so when somebody on the other team gets hot you know you have somebody who can come in and bring the energy to stop them
3862714 players know its three four or five hard minutes and then youre out so give it your all
3862715 and if youre not giving three four or five hard minutes then you dont get back in the rotation
3862716 this is a deep team youve got to stay in that rotation or you could get buried on the bench
3862717 they are athletic they play with a lot of passion and energy and feed off it weve played them quite a bit through the years and we know well have to play well to move on to the next game
3862718 we should be realistic the u s team is strong and they have been winning big
3862719 we want the u s to realize that we deserve their respect but it has to be earned
3862720 we have a luxury in that we dont have to play players 35 minutes a night to get wins
3862721 we can live in that 15 to 20 minutes per game range for our players and have great production i think thats going to be huge as we move forward the fact that were so balanced and we can kind of just rotate everyone in and out
3862722 we have 12 players who can all go out and work and hustle and score so when somebody on the other team gets hot you know you have somebody who can come in and bring the energy to stop them
3862723 players know its three four or five hard minutes and then youre out so give it your all
3862724 and if youre not giving three four or five hard minutes then you dont get back in the rotation
3862725 this is a deep team youve got to stay in that rotation or you could get buried on the bench
3862726 they are athletic they play with a lot of passion and energy and feed off it weve played them quite a bit through the years and we know well have to play well to move on to the next game
3862727 we should be realistic the u s team is strong and they have been winning big
3862728 we want the u s to realize that we deserve their respect but it has to be earned

3862734 consistent top line growth and consistent earnings growth coupled with dividends paid without interruption or reduction over the past 109 years is a formula that investors clearly value
3862735 and on a more subjective level i am hesitant around any book of this type that fills its nonfiction section with the likes of cancer vixen and drawing comics is easy except when its hard while ignoring the works of eddie campbell and insists that batman hush is among the most vital for some reason works of the superhero genre as available in a bookshelf ready format but hey this is truly completely not a book aimed at me anyway
3862736 you will love rediscovering the joy of a wild adventure comic that you cant stop reading you will love laughing at each inevitable change of fortune that makes leotards life so amazing so remarkable you will love once again letting eddie and dan best take hold of your consciousness and imagination and turn them inside out and upside down on the wildest ride youll find in comics this year
3862737 campbells artwork meanwhile is beyond beauty his color work here crosses styles and genres and employs some brilliant panel placement as well
3862738 eddie campbells books are becoming with each passing year more stunning
3862739 first second has made a name for itself by producing quality material but this book outdoes all of its previous endeavors
3862740 its a fine eddie campbell book in the style that no one else could replicate and a joy to read

3862742 doctors dont want patients to suffer they want people to get better
3862743 but they feel stress they feel time constraints they have to deal with pre authorizations its not the kind of practice they wanted theyre stressed and that leads to moving patients along
3862744 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3862745 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that
3862746 the patient needs to realize that the doctor may not be able to discern whats going on in the first visit often it takes a few visits
3862747 if you say its really depressing and upsetting me im in so much pain
3862748 doctors will see it in terms of emotion and treat it as an emotional problem referring you to psychiatric care or antidepressants

3862867 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3862868 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3862869 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3862870 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
3862871 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3862872 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3862873 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist

3862882 you could see he had the ability but he would have to ask the same things over and over again ever since we got him checked out everybody makes a concerted effort to make sure that when they talk to him he can see your lips moving

3862889 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
3862890 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
3862891 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
3862892 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
3862893 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3862894 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3862895 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles

3862912 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
3862913 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver

3862916 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3862917 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3862918 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things

3862928 i love ben stiller and we met him just recently

3862936 hi everybody i hope that the denver convention will be turned into the american equivalent of tiananmen square
3862937 i started saying this was more than my candidate versus your candidate
3862938 the conference was moved to a new location we made an agreement with all our participants that we would treat the proceedings as confidential there was a great deal of information that was generated that our members want to disseminate to their colleagues in their own way
3862939 i really believe she will be the nominee i wouldnt be doing this if i didnt
3862940 marea majoritatea actiunilor bune nu sunt intentionate pentru folosul lumii ci pentru folosul indivizilor din care se compune si binele lumii
3862941 nu simt nevoia unei alte credinte decit credinta mea in bunatatea oamenilor sunt atit de absorbit de minunatia pamintului si viata de pe ea incit nu ma pot gindi la rai si ingeri
3862942 toata gindirea politica a anilor trecuti a fost viciata in acelasi fel oamenii pot sa prevada viitorul numai in cazul in care acesta coincide cu propriile dorinte si cele mai dezgustator de evidente fapte pot fi ignorate daca nu sunt binevenite
3862943 este improbabil ca omenirea sa salveze civilizatia decit daca dezvolta un sistem al binelui si al raului independent de rai si iad

3862945 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
3862946 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
3862947 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
3862948 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
3862949 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
3862950 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
3862951 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character

3862958 let me first say i am a big javale mcgee and un basketball fan and have seen every game for many years javale is full of raw talent and tremendous potential but so far he has displayed a zero basketball iq sure he may get 3 4 spectacular blocks per game but he also commits as many or more stupid plays turnovers etc not to mention the career highs to opposing smaller slower post players javale needs to learn to be aware of whats going on around him on the basketball court to quit pounding his chest when rebounding an airball and to quit making faces like a child when things dont go his way javale youre a man someday you will be the man but for now whipe the looks off your face learn to play as tall as you are and dont even think about the next level
3862959 he may argue that he can volunteer his time as a surgeon in the way that barbra streisand can sing a song for free said mr gross but he added the costs of the equipment the nurses and the hospital would all have to be subject to the campaign limitations
3862960 well ny looked exactly like last year not a good thing hes just not a basketball player all he can do is shoot and pout bayless made him look like a high schooler
3862961 memo to haywood stay healthy and watch ya back homie this guy could be our starting center before you know it
3862962 the craziest stat of the night was that had zero defensive rebounds in the entire game he should have had one on the final possession but he allowed the fall to fall out of his fingers project or not no seven footers should have zero defensive rebounds in a summer league game
3862963 the wizards would be the first ones to tell you that he koponen the finnish guard selected by the blazers a year ago but stashed away overseas this past season gave the crowd something to be excited about as he got it going in the 2 looked like he belonged on the court and played well a definite nba body as well he looked better than mcguire on this night guess we will see how it plays out
3862964 overall impressed with the wiz attitude and the manner in which they played the game
3862965 did you guys see the look on eddie s face when young nick s big three was mentioned he was like damn kids then he quipped that everybody in summer league thinks they re gilbert arenas classic i love when eddie trashes the young guys same thing bill parcells joe gibbs and pat riley would say
3862966 shes a bit of a fool thats the only thing you can say
3862967 dont forget cokie roberts and the whole washington crowd live in a kind of an incestuous relationship to one another they talk to one another they see one another they know nothing about ordinary people

3862981 we saw a pretty big bounce in the crb commodities index today oil prices are higher we have seensome ominous inflation reports from around the world
3862982 the bbc has always been a strong advocate and driver of open industry standards without these standards tv and radio broadcasting would simply not function i believe that the time has come for the bbc to start adopting open standards such as h 264 and aac for our audio and video services on the web these technologies have matured enough to make them viable alternatives to other solutions
3862983 the advantage for the audience will be a noticeable improvement in audio and video quality furthermore it should become easier for the media to simply work across a broader range of devices while its not a magic bullet it certainly is a significant step in the right direction the first service to make content available using these open standards based codecs will be iplayer anthony rose will have more details of introducing h 264 to the iplayer later today it is our intention for other av services across bbc co uk to follow quickly
3862984 the move follows the broadcasters launch of iplayer streams for the ipod touch and iphone which are offered in h 264 and aac

3862994 uns hat die nachricht berrascht auch das zust ndige kommissariat nord wusste nichts
3862995 wir werden nat rlich fahrer ansprechen die sich dar ber hinweg setzen wir sehen dies aber nicht als vorrangige aufgabe der polizeilichen verkehrs berwachung wir k nnen nur im rahmen unserer streife kontrollieren
3862996 wie sollen wir st ndig berwachen wir k nnen lastwagenfahrer auch nicht dazu zwingen vor der br cke zu wenden das g be ein chaos
3862997 da m sste man in letzter konsequenz die alte br cke ganz sperren und den verkehr einspurig ber die neue benachbarte br cke der hansestra e leiten die zurzeit zweispurig stadtausw rts f hrt
3862998 probleme bereitete die erschlie ung die urspr nglichen pl ne sahen eine zufahrt zum baugebiet ber rominten oder rossittenstra e vor

3863000 wir sind vielmehr das eingangstor zu einem netzwerk von hilfsangeboten
3863001 diese frauen m chten ber ihre probleme am liebsten mit weiblichen mitarbeitern sprechen
3863002 junge menschen ab mitte 20 die mit beiden beinen im berufsleben stehen und lebenserfahrung haben
3863003 daraus kristallisieren sich im durchschnitt zwei bis drei richtige opferf lle heraus
3863004 wir geben pers nliche menschliche zuwendung und manchem opfer hilft es schon dass ihnen einfach nur jemand zuh rt
3863005 sie hatte angst aus ihrer wohnung zu m ssen weil sie ja nun die miete nicht mehr aufbringen konnte in einem l ngeren gespr ch gelang es uns die rentnerin zu beruhigen wir haben kontakt mit der vermieterin aufgenommen und ihr die lage erl utert die f llige miete haben wird wenig sp ter dann berwiesen

3863008 die sicherung sollte dem radfahrer mindestens zehn prozent des kaufpreises seines rades wert sein
3863009 it made sense for us to hold our clinic in the youth centre where under 25s are anyway were also holding it in the early evening so it doesnt interfere with work or education we hope people will come along to the open day to find out more about the services on offer the aim is to make them quick and convenient so young people are more willing to come forward for testing
3863010 its troubling they are getting into care late and not getting diagnosed as early and we need to pay attention to that
3863011 part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support
3863012 should not be administered intravenously subcutaneously or inadvertently into fatty tissue
3863013 mis s the point and distrac t from the real issue the persistent health disparities faced by women and men in the african american community
3863014 in other words there is no need to resort to far flung conspiracy theories to explain the higher abortion rate among black women
3863015 long history of discrimination lack of access to high quality affordable health care too few educational and professional opportunities unequal access to safe clean neighborhoods and for some african americans a lingering mistrust of the medical community
3863016 on a daily basis the real life consequences of unequal access to good health care
3863017 strongly believe s that those professing concern for the well being of african american women have an obligation to put the issue of abortion in its proper context and to support evidence based policies that would have a positive impact
3863018 stop throwing out inflammatory terms like genocide and instead channel their considerable energies and resources into supporting policies that reduce the need for abortion
3863019 lets get serious about helping women and their families including women in the african american community
3863020 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3863021 a good 14 year old boy from a good family
3863022 we need information from the public particularly those that live in and around the house
3863023 we would also like to hear from anyone that may know who these offenders are or what the motive for the attack may be
3863024 they the attackers didnt know the boy they didnt know my son they just came off the street
3863025 open and frequent communication between parents and school staff is a key ingredient to keeping food allergic students out of harm
3863026 it takes a partnership to establish effective avoidance strategies and emergency plans
3863027 parents should be aware of expiration dates and keep in contact with their allergist to insure that all medication especially self injectable epinephrine is replaced prior to expiration
3863028 the siding was the first to go then they took the fence then they broke in and took everything else
3863029 i do feel more confident but its not something to talk about
3863030 well rounded look back to his 19 hits in october 2006 i dont like that description well rounded hes always been a complete player
3863031 tomorrow were going to negotiate all day i cant predict the result but its clear that were closer to the demands of prime minister donald tusk than we were a month ago
3863032 we are perhaps going to reap the reward of our efforts
3863033 the american side has considerably softened its stance over recent days
3863034 they are much readier to accept polands two cardinal conditions
3863035 today were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
3863036 the rising international tension which has caught us by surprise makes security guarantees even more important than ever
3863037 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
3863038 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want were not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
3863039 therefore we will use facebook connect to let event organizers and their guests enjoy recommend and promote events within the social context of their real identity and friendships on facebook
3863040 the police party was deployed in front of the police station and a suicide bomber approached them on foot and exploded himself resulting in seven deaths so far

3863044 the two presidents decided to establish diplomatic relations at the level of ambassadors in line with the treaty of the united nations and international law
3863045 instructed their foreign ministries to take the necessary measures in this regard to conform with the laws of the two countries
3863046 discussed the question of the border between the two countries and the people who went missing in syria and lebanon
3863047 assad has instructed all concerned syrian officials that he wants this visit to be successful and fruitful
3863048 the visit is a starting point for future relations we hope it will yield good relations in the interests
3863049 in the face of all those who are manipulating its security and stability
3863050 syria wants a stable united and arab lebanon which does not serve as a trampoline for hostile activities
3863051 the decision was made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our portfolio and enables us to maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
3863052 the loss of such high value subscribers will continue to negatively influence the companys revenue
3863053 continued subscriber losses and investments in customer service improvements are taking a toll on both top line and bottom line growth
3863054 sprint nextel currently expects to report higher post paid subscriber losses in the third quarter due to a seasonal uptick in churn when compared with second quarter 2008 results
3863055 we expect sequential declines in post paid gross adds to moderate and we expect modest pressure on post paid average revenue per user for the balance of 2008 this combination of factors is expected to result in a sequential reduction in adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization for the third quarter capital spending for the wireless and wireline segments is expected to be comparable to first half levels of 1 3 billion and 261 million respectively also expects free cash flow to improve substantially in the second half of 2008 furthermore the company expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants for the foreseeable future and expects to reduce gross debt by at least 1 billion by the end of the third quarter
3863056 we are seeing signs of progress from our efforts to improve the customer experience rebuild the sprint brand and increase our profitability
3863057 our company wide retention efforts which include simply everything plans our now network campaign and the launch of the instinct handset are proving to be effective retention tools particularly for high value customers and this is beginning to have positive impacts on churn and arpu
3863058 here we are with the democratic national party conducting an assault directly on marriage that throws out everything we have known in 6 000 years of history
3863059 i dont think they the people of iowa really believe it yet they dont take it seriously they dont understand the depth of mobilization they wont believe it will happen
3863060 and as you can see from our net add results over the last three or four quarters since the iphone hit the market we continue to be well positioned
3863061 these two strategic investments strengthen our overall growth outlook and provide the opportunity to further expand our wireless market leadership
3863062 we have made the determination to capitalize the interest on the wireless licenses while they are being readied for commercial use as a result we incurred no incremental interest expense in the quarter related to these borrowings
3863063 o cheiro de comida tamb m aumentou mas os outros s o menos atraentes cerveja velha mofo suor ralos e como dizer isso de forma agrad vel flatul ncia
3863064 theirs was a new york love a checkered taxi ride burning rubber and like the city their passion was open 24 7 steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm moist white breath through manhole covers stamped

3863066 office connector really ramped up our adoption of the wiki across the company
3863067 those not familiar with wiki editing now have a much simpler way to publish and edit the wiki through microsoft office
3863068 the new search capabilities are a major bonus to users all around search is easier faster and more intuitive
3863069 weve also made improvements to some of our most popular macros galleries and charts in addition there s a new pagetree macro designed to make documentation management much easier
3863070 this represents not only the best integration with microsoft office of any enterprise wiki application but also a very smooth experience across both microsoft and atlassian products
3863071 i am confident that ric brown will continue to serve the commonwealth with the same enthusiasm and skill that he brought to his time at dpb
3863072 dan timberlake is a fine public servant who is exceptionally qualified to direct the development of the states budget and i look forward to continue working with him in this new capacity
3863073 our goal was to while were going to impact the school district to do it in such a way the average student average parent wont notice it
3863074 the concern is if this economic situation continues to grow and goes into next year and obviously anything we do from here on it in terms of class sizes if they go up they are going to be noticed
3863075 one on one hopefully they wont get too big the classes with the kids
3863076 its very entertaining and a fun place we got people from every state in the united states here that come plus several foreign countries
3863077 yes its very centrally located we get a lot from each coast the west coast we got canadians here people from texas its kind of a gathering point for everybody
3863078 its fun its not like a regular sport in school its very different every environment every horse is different and i like the excitement that you have when you ride a horse
3863079 we are confirming one thing that kirkuk is for all kirkukis from all ethnicities
3863080 they should manage kirkuk together equally so no one could be marginalized
3863081 we want kirkuk to be an iraqi city not a kurdish city or an arab city or a turkmen city
3863082 they can do whatever they want to do but they cannot keep it
3863083 if thats not acceptable then the central government should send its forces to kirkuk to protect us
3863084 or the kurds should increase the number of turkmen serving in kirkuks security forces or someone should bring in international troops because we no longer trust the kurds or the americans who back them
3863085 i mean turkmen buy from me kurds buy from me christians everybody buys from me
3863086 ive never seen anyone an arab or a turkmen say no you are a kurd i will not buy from you so that means we are living together as brothers
3863087 not so great for the spine need to have both on each shoulder
3863088 with too much detail and realism we would not be able to carry on and would get stuck on the wrinkles
3863089 we were amazed to see they actually buildt robots thing
3863090 i dont know what asset smart looks like but anything is better than today anything is better than going out of business because you run out of money
3863091 it might be a partnership with ibm or tsmc or it might be an outright sale of their manufacturing
3863092 now what do we do with the cases of outdated brochures adventure
3863093 we have temporarily suspended sales of judaism discovered but that decision has nothing to do with its content rather it stems entirely from an ongoing dispute regarding intellectual property rights between the author and another individual once that dispute is resolved we look forward to distributing the book
3863094 os 10 games mais dif ceis de todos os tempos
3863095 belo demais ver a vida nascer sentir que a bondade existe e o amor ainda n o perdeu o seu valor
3863096 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
3863097 weve started conversations about it and i think in thenext 30 or 60 days well be able to talk completely aboutthat
3863098 while it isnt every day that a human is violently attacked and eaten by another human its worth noting that it is the norm for many people not to give any thought to the fact that restaurants are serving flesh that comes from innocents who were minding their own business before someone came after them with a knife
3863099 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
3863100 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3863101 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3863102 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3863103 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this

3863189 es muy represivo desde el momento en que ocup el poder hay m s carest a masacres entre los grupos de narcotraficantes y lo mismo sucede con zeferino torreblanca la cosa est igual se asemejan porque pareciera que tienen la misma estructura al entrar como gobierno junto con chavarr a el secretario de gobierno de guerrero que pol ticamente viene de la izquierda han reprimido a los estudiantes de ayotzinapa a los dirigentes sociales nosotros como erpi sabemos que zeferino es el represor y el empresario que siempre ha apostado a enriquecerse m s reprimi a los maestros en acapulco y ahora entr con mano dura respetamos a las bases que dec an que iban a apoyarlo pero ah est n las consecuencias

3863292 we have immediately published this proposal for public comment because of its potential to increase the likelihood that those who engage in insider trading will be caught and punished

3863301 during the three and six months ended june 30 2008 our european sales to which we have paid greater attention continue to show strong growth
3863302 in the quarter we continued our efforts toward reducing our cost of goods sold which has helped offset the impact of the weakening dollar against the chinese yuan we continue to experience some softness in orders as our larger var value added reseller channel orders are often related to large capital expenditures particularly in the healthcare banking and financial sectors we are encouraged by the initial success of a product pilot project with a new customer we are confident that several unique vertical integrations of our technology will deliver efficiencies and a competitive advantage as they roll out in the remainder of 2008 and the early part of 2009 we continue to introduce new products that meet our customers needs including one in early june that has drawn a very positive response two additional new products are expected to be introduced before the end of the year
3863303 subsequent to the end of the quarter there were some important changes to our board highlighted by the boards unanimous consent naming edward m straw as chairman we welcome mr straws participation on the board and his 30 year track record as a leader in global logistics and supply chain management and believe he as well as the rest of the board will be a valuable asset to our management team through eds extensive contact network and relationships we believe he will be a key contributor to current initiatives were working on as well as the development of our customer base and sales pipeline with the objective of accelerating our top and bottom line growth
3863304 he came in and went into this office and started shooting

3863312 calls to reform social security through privatization are a cry wolf wall street giveaway which would turn social security from a guarantee to a gamble they are the real threat to the program
3863313 its time to end the widespread myth that social security is faltering
3863314 the congressional budget office has reported each of the past five years that social security will be fully solvent through 2052 and after that will be 80 funded able to pay more actual benefits than now one third of the bush tax cuts for the wealthy or one third of the cost of the iraq war would cover the possible shortfall we have the money
3863315 social security has been the most successful social program in u s history reducing poverty among seniors by 73 it is little known that the ample social security surplus has already paid for eleven annual shortfalls since 1963 the surplus is designed to pay for benefits for seniors and to cover any shortfall years to take and deplete that surplus to fund other federal initiatives like tax breaks for the wealthy or pay for the questionable iraq war would be inexcusable
3863316 the real problem is medicare soaring healthcare costs are driving the entitlement to grow at a rate much faster than the u s economy the hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted by 2019
3863317 however health providers block the few real steps congress attempts including legislation to authorize medicare to negotiate best rates with pharmaceutical companies and to allow patients to import safe affordable drugs
3863318 a national health insurance plan could absorb and fix medicares problems

3863374 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3863375 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

3863379 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3863380 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3863381 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3863382 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from words to deeds
3863383 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3863384 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3863444 we save a lot of banks by being able to work with them avoiding failures that would be costly to the insurance fund
3863445 the only ones that people see are the ones that fail
3863446 in some of these cases i believe regulators should act sooner than later to prevent future losses to the fund
3863447 ask yourself why would a borrower be interested in a lender thats three states away its probably because theyre having difficulty getting loans from banks that really know that community

3863459 we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3863460 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare

3863475 do you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined a world of fear and treachery and torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself progress in our world will be progress toward more pain

3863498 i also wondered why the 911 hijackers spent a weekend in las vegas gambling and boozing it up
3863499 our amnesia about what is natural is the greatest threat to the environment
3863500 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
3863501 lack of political will and the greed of special interests
3863502 simply enforcing the standards of the magnuson stevens act and the u s national marine fisheries service would result in major improvements in u s waters within a decade
3863503 our findings suggest that many former child soldiers may need more than interventions to reduce the mental health problems associated with surviving bombings and torture often they have to endure being stigmatized when they return to their home villages
3863504 these findings suggest that there is something else in addition to war trauma that is causing problems for the former child soldiers
3863505 one hypothesis is that the reintegration process puts added stress on them
3863506 i want a career that allows me to do evidence based research and provide mental health care to those in the most desperate need
3863507 ik voelde dat mijn lichaam klaar was om te slapen maar mijn hoofd nog niet
3863508 i led in the abramoff hearings in the in the obscure indian affairs committee for which people are still testifying and going to jail
3863509 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption
3863510 no position title or official role in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one
3863511 will be coming to atlanta on august 18 for a very special event at the marriott marquis downtown and i have agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team
3863512 if you select to use your credit card you may fax the form to me
3863513 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington
3863514 do you think you might be able to contact karl as i am sure you have more weight there
3863515 talked to rove about this and i think i killed it hes on it keep this between us dont want to raise expectations but i banged on this one hard
3863516 its a big number from a really small volume manufacturer on an obvious and important part of the vehicle
3863517 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3863518 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3863519 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3863520 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3863521 que nos es una balada como muchos de vosotros pensar is
3863522 the original ae1 continues to be one of our strongest sellers and frankly one of our greatest sources of pride
3863523 after 20 years we are excited to offer this limited edition to audiophiles who appreciate the best because they are the ones who have supported acoustic energy since the very beginning
3863524 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3863525 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3863526 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3863527 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3863528 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3863529 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3863530 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3863531 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3863532 the event management company which comes under the purview of the state government through a state owned corporation will still be organising and managing the tournament but there will be some new faces at the helm after the state government decides on the fate of current shareholders
3863533 the state government will honour the agreement between t best events and world match racing tour which will see the monsoon cup competition in pulau duyong until 2012 the government will continue to allocate rm4 million annually for the tournament
3863534 the sailing event may have featured world class sailors and top ranked match racers but in order to pull in the crowd we need something that is more familiar to locals such as rowing competitions using traditional wooden longboats and olympic sized fibreglass longboats
3863535 come december we are not only going to have just the monsoon cup competition there will also be an international longboat race featuring rowers from indonesia singapore thailand and other countries
3863536 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3863537 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3863538 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3863539 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3863540 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3863541 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3863542 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
3863543 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3863544 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3863545 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3863546 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3863547 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3863548 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3863549 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3863550 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3863551 the issue to be debated involves the rights of parties which have not been clarified by the federal court
3863552 it is not proper that discussions and forums organised to address such concerns be disparaged on the pretext that such forums can provoke misunderstanding
3863553 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini and shamala revisited
3863554 our concern is that there are increasingly more families caught up in the conflict of laws arising from the conversion of one spouse to islam
3863555 this issue must be addressed and we must all work to seek an acceptable solution for all concerned parties
3863556 it was an ugly game but the result was good because we reached our objective
3863557 the second half was especially bad while there were some incidents in the first period such as the penalty and the sending off which showed the teams were going for the prize
3863558 the boys did well to manage the game and it paid off that we won the first two games in difficult conditions and on bad pitches
3863559 i can understand the disapproval of the supporters but we achieved our target and avoided brazil
3863560 im so happy we escaped we played under a lot of pressure after messing up our first two games this match was decisive for us
3863561 theyre out there playing like theyre back on the streets unbelievable then theres the deserved penalty kick out of nothing and youre through to the next round
3863562 now argentine are waiting for us in the quarterfinal hopefully we can escape once again and make it to beijing
3863563 there are many players linked to out club chievo but we will continue to work with calm

3863619 however what i know is that 40 per cent of the 102 who signed the petition were unclear about the issue they claimed they signed the petition based on trust and friendship with those directly involved
3863620 thats why 30 signatories have decided to withdraw the others maybe 70 per cent of them i question their commitment to the sport as they have yet to contribute to hockey after retirement

3863679 slipshod cryptographic housekeeping left some openid services far less secure than they ought to be
3863680 openid is a shared identity service that enables users to eliminate the need for punters to create separate ids and logins for websites that support the service a growing number of around 9 000 websites support the decentralised service which offers a a url based system for single sign on
3863681 security researchers discovered the websites run by three openid providers including sun microsystems used ssl certificates with weak crypto keys
3863682 keys generated by cryptographically flawed systems still needed to be replaced even after the software was upgraded
3863683 to exploit the vulnerability malicious hackers would need to trick surfers into visiting a site impersonating a pukka openid provider
3863684 the security flaw meant that even cautious users who check ssl certificates were at risk of handing over their openid credentials as part of a phishing attack
3863685 going after online banking credentials via a site that makes no attempt to offer up fake ssl certificates is a far more reliable moneyspinner a factor that leads noted security researcher richard clayton to describe the attack as the
3863686 sun has responded to the issue by generating a new secure key which reduces the scope for mischief but still leaves potential problems from the old key
3863687 more thoughts on the cryptographically interesting though not especially life threatening flaw can be found in claytons posting on cambridge universitys light the blue touchpaper blog here a security advisory by laurie and clayton explaining the issue in greater depth can be found here

3863786 what we know is that if you see a very frail person next to somebody not so frail the very frail person is more likely to have alzheimers pathology in their brain when they die
3863787 this is important as we try to wrap our heads around the biology of aging
3863788 because it turns out that as you get older alzheimers pathology signs of its development are really ubiquitous even if that doesnt mean that you actually have dementia so this finding could alter the way most medical and non medical people conceptualize alzheimers as a disease simply of impaired memory and cognition while expanding our view of what it actually means to become frail

3863823 while im certain that she would have done a tremendous job at fame the university system needs her right now
3863824 its critical for the university system to get its finances in order
3863825 given the financial difficulties facing the university of maine system and the recent troubles at the university of southern maine becky is the best person to help safeguard one of our states most important public assets
3863826 this was a policy disagreement i had with administrator johnson who is in a very difficult situation
3863827 i respect the administrator though i do disagree with the policies he has pursued
3863828 i was invited back to epa to do a job and i did all this administration wanted me to do this administration has declined to decide what to do about the profound policy challenge of global warming this administration has decided to make itself irrelevant
3863829 i do not know what motivated him to say that he suddenly realized that this administration wasnt going to do anything
3863830 nobody knows for sure why he went public and started ratting out his colleagues
3863831 he was one of the political insiders at epa people on staff at epa are stunned that hes trying to rewrite history and say that he was a good guy all along
3863832 while he and i ultimately didnt agree on the right way to set an air quality standard
3863833 he liked how i operated he liked my expertise and experience in applying economic analysis to environmental policy making
3863834 it will have legal significance requiring epa to then issue the first federal greenhouse gas regulations i believe that much of the work we did will help the next administration
3863835 it was environmentally bad and flagrantly illegal on its face
3863836 he came into a lot of ill repute at the agency during the mercury battles
3863837 he was one of the principle architects for a policy that proved to be a total disaster from an air pollution standpoint
3863838 my basic philosophy of the regulation is fairly straight forward
3863839 some regulations are quite beneficial to the well being of our country and some of them arent ive tried to apply a consistent set of principles to each inquiry
3863840 was that administrator johnson declined to provide a stronger soot standard
3863841 california has met the test of the clean air act
3863842 sure hes giving corroboration that the leader of epa is a scoundrel
3863843 but whats being done about it the career epa staff people have been keeping their heads down for seven years they figure they might as well keep them down for another five months
3863844 because hes confirming what many of us have known for years that bush and cheney have been especially disastrous on environmental matters

3863958 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3863959 what a sin and a scandal it is to see these armies shedding each others blood
3863960 that such an event can happen is a poignant reminder of how often among orthodox christians no less than others national identity easily takes priority over our common identity as children of the one god
3863961 we hope to see you both standing side by side in continuing efforts to promote peace between the russian federation and the democratic republic of georgia to collaborate in healing the deep wounds left by this tragic conflict and to bear witness in unity to the gospel of christs peace who called us to love not slay each other
3863962 role and authority of our churches to prevent the escalation of tensions and help restore good bilateral relations
3863963 today blood is being shed and people being killed in south ossetia and my heart deeply laments over it orthodox christians are among those who have raised their hands against each other orthodox people called by the lord to live in fraternity and love confront each other
3863964 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3863965 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3863966 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3863967 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in

3863969 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3863970 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions

3864116 los sectores financieros externos no nos perdonan el pago de la deuda
3864117 del establishment financiero tal vez nunca nos perdonen por haber recuperado el sistema de decisi n en la econom a nacional luego de la cancelaci n de la deuda con el fondo monetario internacional y creen que es posible reintentar viejas formulas

3864129 in the wonderful 2004 vintage owner winemaker peter sisseck has outdone himself if i were just starting to build a wine collection and had limited income i can think of no better foundation than a dozen bottles of 2004 flor de pingus in the context of the worlds great wines it is a stupendous value a steal it is 100 tempranillo from very low yields and is aged 14 months in 100 new french barriques opaque purple in colour it emits already complex aromas of smoke toast coffee blueberry blackberry and liquorice lush on the palate super ripe and sweet as well as multi dimensional this great effort can be drunk now but id opt for cellaring it for 6 8 years to allow further evolution
3864130 it comes from 100 estate vineyards biodynamically farmed it too is 100 tempranillo and is aged 18 months in new french oak it offers more of everything from its splendid nose of cedar smoke charcaoal blackberry and blueberry to its thick superconcentrated and layered mid palate the tannins are totally concealed and the pure finish is remarkable long the wine deserves at least a decase of cellaring and should drink beautifully for 25 years thereafter

3864152 but they were proud of me before the great story to sell would be this instant success where it turns my life around but before this i think they were always just happy that i was living a life that i enjoyed
3864153 i have an idea about what im doing for the next book and ive got hundreds of pages of notes already taken

3864224 this same concept has been proven time and again throughout the decades since todays recessions come on more gradually than the great depression any time there is a financial recession it is directly governed by the attitudes of the people as a whole when the masses believe the outlook is bleak they act financially speaking accordingly when they begin to regain hope the populace spends more freely and the recession recedes again this is an economic cycle that is repeated over and over but there is never a single moment experts can point to that signifies the beginning or end of the recession instead the start and end points are defined in retrospect

3864285 the loss of such high value subscribers will continue to negatively influence the companys revenue
3864286 continued subscriber losses and investments in customer service improvements are taking a toll on both top line and bottom line growth
3864287 sprint nextel currently expects to report higher post paid subscriber losses in the third quarter due to a seasonal uptick in churn when compared with second quarter 2008 results
3864288 we expect sequential declines in post paid gross adds to moderate and we expect modest pressure on post paid average revenue per user for the balance of 2008 this combination of factors is expected to result in a sequential reduction in adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization for the third quarter capital spending for the wireless and wireline segments is expected to be comparable to first half levels of 1 3 billion and 261 million respectively also expects free cash flow to improve substantially in the second half of 2008 furthermore the company expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants for the foreseeable future and expects to reduce gross debt by at least 1 billion by the end of the third quarter
3864289 we are seeing signs of progress from our efforts to improve the customer experience rebuild the sprint brand and increase our profitability

3864325 we have begun to enroll patients in our phase 3 trial of corlux for the psychotic features of psychotic depression and anticipate that we will have a sufficient number of patients enrolled by late 2009 to enable the data safety monitoring board independent of the company to perform an interim analysis evaluating safety and top line efficacy results from the first half of the study we have also initiated sites and are screening patients for enrollment into our phase 3 pivotal study of corlux for the treatment of endogenous cushings syndrome because only an estimated 10 to 15 of every one million people are newly diagnosed each year with cushings syndrome identification and enrollment of the 50 patients for the study is anticipated to be an extended process

3864327 we have immediately published this proposal for public comment because of its potential to increase the likelihood that those who engage in insider trading will be caught and punished this should send a strong warning to those who would undermine market integrity and undercut investor confidence for their own personal gain
3864328 in light of the current economic climate we have taken what we believe to be an aggressive approach in determining the probability of losses in our loan portfolio while this approach had a very negative effect on our second quarter results we are pleased that the companys capital ratios remained above the well capitalized level which is the highest regulatory capital rating recognized by bank regulatory authorities at june 30 2008 our banking subsidiary had 78 3 million of tier 1 capital resulting in a leverage ratio of 8 14 to be well capitalized the minimum required leverage ratio is 5 00 or higher which in our case would have required only 48 1 million of tier 1 capital in addition we believe that we continue to have strong liquidity as we held 85 2 million of liquid assets at june 30 2008 while the prevailing economic environment is challenging especially to banks we intend to continue to take steps that will preserve the long term safety and soundness of our institution and to maintain our capital ratios at levels that will continue to result in our company being well capitalized
3864329 we continued to work aggressively to identify problem loans and to pursue favorable resolutions of any issues associated with those problem loans we are pleased with our progress in reducing our balances of acquisition and development and residential construction loans and we are hopeful that our conservative approach will continue to serve us well in this difficult economy

3864344 based on the findings of our company wide evaluation completed in the first quarter of 2008 it became clear that some significant changes were necessary to return the company to a more profitable footing
3864345 on june 25th we implemented these changes and now with the majority of this transition behind us the company is free to move ahead as a more agile and responsive business by focusing on our core strengths controlling costs and increasing the scalability and efficiency of our supply chain were now free to focus on what we do best delivering quality solar powered lights and power systems and we can do it more efficiently and effectively than ever before
3864346 even with the costs and strategic challenges of implementing this comprehensive restructuring the company has achieved its second quarterly positive adjusted ebitda in a row
3864347 as expected the restructuring charge which will be recorded over the next several quarters is on schedule and to be recovered during the 2009 fiscal year with increased cash no bank debt and continued positive cash flow were going into the next quarter looking stronger than ever
3864348 we are disappointed with our q2 advertising results which were significantly impacted by a gap in staffing and stock market conditions

3864360 she came to the shop with a baby and a girl
3864361 the woman asked me several questions about the flowers while her daughter wandered around the shop later the woman asked me for a glass of water and i went to get it

3864386 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3864387 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3864388 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3864389 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3864390 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3864391 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3864392 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3864393 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3864394 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3864395 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3864398 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3864399 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3864414 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3864415 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3864416 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3864417 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers
3864418 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3864419 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3864420 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3864421 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3864422 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media

3864424 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3864425 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3864426 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3864427 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3864428 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3864429 the ferag finishing lines we have acquired recently give us the opportunity to relocate finishing from greaves to our other print sites thereby improving efficiency and reducing transportation
3864430 this closure represented another hammer blow to the print and packaging industry which is already reeling from the closures of curtis and beith and the announced job cuts at sappi and johnston press
3864431 which would you prefer a reduction to previous levels of power supplies or some form of manpower system based on employing more full time staff but flexed on some form of average hours basis which would you choose
3864432 we want little big planet to lead the charge into a new genre of gaming and turn sackboy into the next emblematic character for the ps3
3864433 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3864434 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3864435 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3864436 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3864437 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3864438 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3864439 you forgave them for throwing away your concert ticket collection
3864440 time to pretend is a space rock gem that mocks the clich d coke and hookers rock star lifestyle over big synth whooshes
3864441 hoy quienes est n en el r gimen contributivo reciben un mayor n mero de medicinas que quienes est n en el r gimen subsidiado necesitamos que la corte nos diga si esto viola o no viola el principio de igualdad la ley 100 tampoco contempla el por qu de la diferencia
3864442 our members in johnston press want to produce high quality local papers but they are finding they have to work incredibly long hours sometimes dangerously long hours in order to do so
3864443 each song cash reeled off that day spoke his understanding of prison life dark as each song described confinement in some sense in a coal mine in love in poverty making clear to the men that they werent the only ones imprisoned and between songs he conversed with the men on their level grumbling about wardens and dishing out off color jokes
3864444 nothing brushed cash with darkness as broadly as at folsom prison
3864445 mostly due to its loud suggestion that cash had done hard time could any listener be blamed for thinking it hadnt he sounded devilishly conspiratorial with the men whom he entertained hadnt they cheered him like a brother didnt his voice sound gallows grave and the scar on his cheek look like a knife wound the grammy winning liner notes that cash wrote only fueled the myth i have been behind bars a few times wrote cash sometimes of my own volition sometimes involuntarily each time i felt the same feeling of kinship with my fellow prisoner for the rest of his years he uncomfortably lived with the myth knowing that hed conspired in its birth
3864446 i shot a man in reno just to watch him die

3864449 and a few months before the shocking assassinations of luther king jr and robert f kennedy the albums performances and cash penned liner notes urged listeners to remember the caged men much like king shone the spotlight on disenfranchised blacks and the voiceless poor the album also tapped into the yearnings of late sixties music fans around the world who wanted from their music more viscosity more depth more reality more rebellion at folsom prison gave it to them songs performed with unrelenting passion a performer who would let nobody stand in his way and a look at a failing prison system
3864450 all of our people will remember him as a hero a big leader as well as a great poet
3864451 he is one of us he knew what we feel and how we suffer an amazing person
3864452 i will cry and scream today because we will miss him so much
3864453 the most important thing about him is that he maintained an unimpeachable moral integrity political and intellectual authority
3864454 that was an unparalleled source of legitimacy and elevated his words to a higher plane
3864455 he was extremely encouraging and positive he always had a definite opinion but he was always very supportive
3864456 i was so happy to know that my poetry was noticed by someone like mahmoud darwish
3864457 he didnt instruct me but told me that it is important to read and contemplate to produce good poetry
3864458 it is the end of a special part of our lives as palestinians
3864459 he left a path a model of being a politically committed artist with high artistic and aesthetic integrity a way of achieving universality
3864460 we believe that standard chartered needs to strengthen its equity tier 1 ratio from the current level of 6 1 per cent which puts it close to the bottom versus 70 asian banks under coverage
3864461 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage
3864462 will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3864463 worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3864464 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3864465 weakening consumer spending will likely hurt all ad categories in 2008 we think 2009 may be just as bad if not worse
3864466 relative upside at the other end of this tunnel with regional newspapers retaining local higher priced advertising
3864467 our view is that micro focus is very well attuned to the current economic climate anticipating that the market and operational commentary should remain positive we retain our buy

3864476 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
3864477 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
3864478 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3864479 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3864480 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country

3864488 there are probably enough lonmin shareholders who want to sell out and invest in other mining plays the rejection does not mean that we wont see a takeover
3864489 we see the bid as opportunistic synergy driven and likely to succeed
3864490 we see very little chance of a counter bid and it is a case of who blinks first between xstrata and the lonmin shareholders
3864491 lonmin shareholders are rightly fed up with incumbent management and we feel they will definitely not back a go it alone strategy and will want to lose this offer
3864492 when managements are this unloved platinum group metals prices are weak and interloper risk is low xstrata have a fair chance of taking this home at the offer price
3864493 we believe there is a good chance that johnston press will announce a specific costs target or signal a significant exercise is under way to improve efficiency
3864494 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3864495 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive jose manuel calderon said the team was responding to a request from the photographer
3864496 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3864497 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3864498 well we thought it was funny but if you uptight bastards found it offensive well sorry
3864499 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3864500 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3864501 it is something that has affected me personally i think players leaders and the media have to join forces so that no one feels looked down upon because of the color of their skin at this moment in time i prefer my children dont go to football matches in the stands they have to listen to things that are difficult to explain to a child it is better they arent exposed to it
3864502 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3864503 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word
3864504 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3864505 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3864506 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports

3864517 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3864518 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3864519 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3864520 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3864521 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3864522 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3864523 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3864524 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3864525 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3864526 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3864527 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3864528 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3864529 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3864530 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3864531 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3864532 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3864533 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3864537 if one or other of the companies is successful in securing a contract for training from the us defence department a contract could be signed with a successful bidder within the next few months
3864538 water is seeping in and pooling under the white latex coating that was supposed to protect these aircraft from the elements and preserve them in a saleable condition
3864539 the current market value of the skyhawks will be dropping daily especially given the further damage that will have inevitably occurred in the recent bad weather experienced by the marlborough region

3864606 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3864607 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3864608 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3864609 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3864610 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3864611 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3864612 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3864613 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3864614 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3864615 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3864616 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3864617 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3864618 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3864619 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3864620 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3864621 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3864622 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3864623 i have to be careful because sometimes hell do a fast movement or run

3864647 since nigerian government is adamant or does not know what to do we shall take the matter on our own
3864648 dont say something and do another so we have to be very careful
3864649 we will rather go back to our states and establish ourselves rather than go back to bakassi the cameroonians are hostile arrogant merciless we need not to have anything to with them
3864650 from the onset we have said we are not cameroonians why should nigerian government and these white people force us to where we do not belong what about our forefathers graves are we going with them
3864651 the bakassi peninsula dispute settlement as model for african border conflicts management
3864652 it is regrettable that nigeria will have to give out bakassi to the cameroon but the if the federal government does do so it will amount to disobeying the ruling of the international court of justice and this may not be good for the image of the country
3864653 section 12 of the 1999 constitution is very clear on the implementation of treaties and that was why the minority whip femi gbajabiamilah raised that motion under matters of urgent national importance and the house passed a resolution asking the executive to forward the agreement to national assembly
3864654 no treaty between the federation and any other country shall have the force of law except to the extent to which any such treaty has been enacted into law by the national assembly
3864655 but it is sad that a government that prides itself on strict adherence to the principle of rule of law and due process to be saying one thing and going through the back door to do the opposite
3864656 what has been of concern to the president and will be a priority to him is the welfare of the people of bakassi as bona fide citizens of nigeria who have found themselves in a territory legally given to another country
3864657 it is a commitment we have made to the international community and we have a responsibility to keep it
3864658 with respect to bakassi fortunately there are no legal encumbrances as many imagine

3864781 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative

3864784 i think theres no doubt that youth are going to turn out at rates higher than in previous elections

3864795 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3864796 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3864797 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions

3864826 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3864827 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3864828 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3864829 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3864830 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well

3864833 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3864834 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3864835 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3864836 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3864837 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese

3864839 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3864840 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3864841 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3864842 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time
3864843 omg what the hell do i say holy crap holy crap what do i say

3864856 the possible responses to a given question might be correct in circumstances other than those described in the question thus in selecting an answer you must choose the best answer from among the available choices other options may be correct but are not the best choice for the defined circumstances
3864857 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3864858 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3864859 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3864860 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3864861 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3864862 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3864863 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3864864 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3864865 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3864866 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3864867 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3864868 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3864869 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3864870 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3864871 sequential treatment with dox doxorubicin followed by zol zoledronic acid elicited substantial antitumor effects in subcutaneous breast tumors in vivo in the absence of bone disease
3864872 our work using a model system has shown that treatment with the chemotherapy agent doxorubicin followed by zoledronic acid kills breast tumours
3864873 may benefit the most if these two drugs are given in this particular order
3864874 the results of a large breast cancer trial later this year to confirm our findings this method of treatment could then quickly be incorporated into clinical practice
3864875 the results of this study are very encouraging and could change the way breast cancer patients are treated the good news is the two treatments used in this study are relatively inexpensive and already used in the clinic therefore we should quickly see the benefits giving women the best possible chance of beating breast cancer

3864877 weve signed my new contract today wednesday lampard told chelsea tv
3864878 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3864879 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3864880 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it lampard said
3864881 the club gave me time and i appreciate that i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3864882 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player kenyon said
3864883 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3864884 it is continuing hopefully not for as long as the speculation about frank he said
3864885 weve still got a few days left of the window and hopefully well get a result

3864904 cloud seeding a form of weather modification is the attempt to change the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud the usual intent is to increase precipitation rain or snow but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports
3864905 government action is important but we must also consider our own behaviour for the sake of the planet we must wean ourselves off the notion that a weekend bender in prague has no consequences other than a hangover

3864907 when youre young all you think about is enjoyment you dont really worry about what the future holds being a youth

3864909 after the world juniors people were saying youre fast kid i was 15 then and they said you can be one of the greatest
3864910 that did not mean a lot to me then but now i know what theyre talking about
3864911 a lot of people my parents my coach my agent everybody trying to say you have a bright future in track and field and explain what you can get out of it and so on
3864912 i started with coach mills in 2005 and from that moment on ive been going up
3864913 i started slow but now im there and im just trying to stay on top now
3864914 i hadnt had much chance to run the 100 metres my coach has been forcing me to run the 400
3864915 i guess its just instinct im working on im just trying to stay away from the 400 metres
3864916 i guess i just blew peoples minds with the 100
3864917 there have been claims in the past that have been made against our card or other cards and happily theyve all been able to be dismissed or dealt with
3864918 my intent in the future is to make it so there is no such thing as a refusal you can refuse all you want but we are going to aggressively seek search warrants
3864919 the advantage for the audience will be a noticeable improvement in audio and video quality furthermore it should become easier for the media to simply work across a broader range of devices while its not a magic bullet it certainly is a significant step in the right direction

3864925 and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3864926 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire
3864927 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3864928 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3864929 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
3864930 all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
3864931 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3864932 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
3864933 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
3864934 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
3864935 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3864936 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3864937 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3864938 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
3864939 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
3864940 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3864941 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves
3864942 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
3864943 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3864944 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3864945 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3864946 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3864947 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3864948 were doing our best to keep up with them and to best understand the situation its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3864949 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3864950 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3864951 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project

3864959 the embedded republican vote in a presidential election has been fairly solid for almost three decades now so you would have to say that mccain has an edge but im going to tell you that the obama people have been pouring resources in here
3864960 the obama campaign has some potential to win some voters to change the dynamics by making a strong run in the big metropolitan areas here filled with high tech workers and the type of people who dont fit the classic old south new south model
3864961 shes a bit of a fool thats the only thing you can say
3864962 dont forget cokie roberts and the whole washington crowd live in a kind of an incestuous relationship to one another they talk to one another they see one another they know nothing about ordinary people

3864964 the new iphone is performing very well on our network

3864971 it was certainly the hardest golf course ive ever played in my life
3864972 even the great guys struggled on the golf course the greens are really sloped and the rough was very severe
3864973 to be able to go back and participate as a player and to have my family there was really special
3864974 it was a real rollercoaster for me when he left because i was right in the middle of doing this and hes leaving for college
3864975 we can look at smaller doses and we can look at slightly higher doses

3865000 the navigator but i do believe he has a kind of veto influence over big issues
3865001 by the same token fidel realizes that he is no longer president and has to allow his successors to chart their own course within certain broad parameters
3865002 has managed to both organize a political succession to his brother raul and to chaperon the new government

3865004 i felt a little twinge during my second at bat
3865005 i knew right away that my season would probably be over its just heartbreaking
3865006 i guess its a case of one man gathers what another man spills
3865007 im definitely glad to be in the lineup to be honest i wasnt even all that worried when chipper took over for me because hes always pulling something or straining something else guy cant stay healthy im so fat that i dont even have an oblique so its not a problem
3865008 yeah thats correct no more than nine pitches per start
3865009 we want joba to be a starter and we think he can be a great one so hes going to get out there and throw either nine pitches or three innings per start whichever comes first
3865010 were not just going to limit his pitches during games
3865011 that would be retarded weve got a whole host of things were going to do to protect joba for example were not going to let him waste a bunch of strength and energy in the bullpen getting all warmed up instead were not going to have him throw any warm ups at all by doing that and just coming into the game and gunning it hes going to be really fresh for all of his pitches that he makes in the game all nine of them or less if we can swing it
3865012 by keeping the flow of blood out of jobas arm at all times when hes not in a game we hope to keep it light and loose
3865013 also we are going to make him get a tattoo on his arm that says invincible sure he wont be able to get buried in a jewish cemetery but with an invincible arm who will care
3865014 a most astounding call to action came a fortnight ago from patrick henry as he addressed the house of burgesses give me liberty or give me death he shouted to the crowd he then added getcha popcorn ready such a scene i have never seen the words were beautifully chosen as though the preparation of the popcorn would heighten our anticipation of the magnificence to come even the unorthodox word choice demonstrates the wisdom and brilliance of the sentiment the use of the contraction getcha to imbue the situation with the urgency and magnitude that only a revolution would merit
3865015 you can gimme liberty or gimme death but the second matter is less a choice and more a four word demand getcha popcorn ready bitch
3865016 im a little nonplussed about the whole favre situation and how that played out
3865017 not angry per se definitely not irate nor perturbed just a bit nonplussed
3865018 hes constantly using that stupid word i guess it means sort of displeased or annoyed without really being displeased or annoyed to be honest its very tarvaris to not go all the way with something
3865019 well when ap running back adrian peterson dropped that pass on the screen play i was a bit nonplussed
3865020 i was also nonplussed when i found out we were having mac and cheese for the fourth day in a row as the side dish in the cafeteria and i was equally nonplussed when i couldnt find my helmet for the afternoon practice
3865021 im nonplussed that we have a interception throwing quarterback that whines all the time i mean we could have had brett favre

3865023 at first when he came with a little knife i didnt realise he was trying to rob my shop i thought it was a joke
3865024 i thought he couldnt do much with his little knife so i went to the back of the shop and got a mop and started hitting him
3865025 i was just trying to defend myself and the shop i work from 9am until we close at 10 30pm seven days a week
3865026 i took my hands up and said go ahead and take everything
3865027 if i did some damage to him then id get in trouble too
3865028 i think we did pretty well you cant let him get away with a little knife

3865030 the haunt industry fits into a special niche of the entertainment world where the main goal is to provide an intensely frightening experience yet leave customers exhilarated enough to return next year or even next week
3865031 in order to accomplish this a tremendous amount of production is involved in each successful haunt owners have behind the scenes teams of master hollywood special effects technicians make up artists set designers and trained actors this list represents the best of the best in the country
3865032 this list is based on the opinions of the most influential and successful haunt owners and operators in the entire industry
3865033 there are hundreds of haunted attractions in america so this is truly a great honor for our crew of local artists builders and actors
3865034 you dont want to count your chickens before theyre hatched hopefully we will be the first movie to take down dark knight though

3865044 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3865045 theres a need to have a look at what the cultural identity is here
3865046 we know about the various activities and events but we wanted to go a little deeper the area is growing so fast and there are so many newcomers including immigrants theres a whole wealth of talent we thought wed try to find out more about them
3865047 arts and culture are vital parts of our day to day lives from books to visual arts to theatre music etc and those things form the soul of the community were trying to investigate that a bit
3865048 a process of collecting recording analysing and synthesizing information in order to describe the cultural resources networks links and patterns of usage of a given community or group
3865049 its really a broad range of things and thats why one of the first things were doing is to look at the definitions of culture
3865050 set of distinctive spiritual material intellectual and emotional features of society
3865051 were trying to be careful at the beginning to not let it be too huge
3865052 otherwise it becomes overwhelming were trying to keep it manageable were taking small steps
3865053 weve still got a few days left of the window hopefully well get a result
3865054 definitely he is going to stay with us the coach schuster has said he wants him in our team
3865055 we dont see any possibility of robinho leaving real madrid
3865056 it would be a dream for me to work with luiz felipe scolari who is one of the best coaches in the world
3865057 a key issue over buying robinho has always been that real are looking for a replacement
3865058 our investment in this new e signature capability is indicative of our belief that service in our industry must be transformed to maximize a firms success and deliver a great experience for end clients

3865068 we recommend that the pcgg terminate immediately the services of the two remaining chief of staff of commissioner abcede since the tasks that they were doing as pcgg ee expense entitlement personnel can be done by the commissioners legal counsel and three executive assistants
3865069 we recommend that pcgg management cause the refund of the excess cellular phone charges totaling p227 792 36
3865070 with one designated as chief of staff external with a monthly salary of p28 000 and the other chief of staff internal with a monthly salary of p24 000
3865071 we also noted that as chiefs of staff under ee they are non career employees yet exercising supervision over regular and career personnel which is a clear violation of csc mc civil service commission memorandum circular 26 a s 1997
3865072 since they are not government officials employees they cannot be held accountable for their overt acts neglects or omissions while performing the duties and responsibilities of public officers or employees
3865073 are not covered by csc law and rules governing regular positions or positions in the career service
3865074 their designation and assignment of duties are purely internal in the office of commissioner abcede moreover they exercise supervisory authority only over employees who are paid from sources under similar category
3865075 regarding the observation compensation it may be mentioned that those covered by contracts are usually given higher salary rates than those holding plantilla items
3865076 significant increase of mobile telephone expenses by 48 percent compared to 2005 mobile expenses
3865077 clarifying previous order on cell phone cap that the maximum monthly allocation of p10 000 and p5 000 for the official use of pcgg issued cellular phones do not apply in cases where the official concerned is abroad on official business and the charges on text messages and voice calls are made by virtue thereof inclusive of the corresponding roaming charges taxes and other charges
3865078 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
3865079 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
3865080 we have to study the interplay of demand and supply the oil companies are of course responding also to world prices
3865081 we will see how things develop its good prices are going down
3865082 the current trends such as the reduction of the world oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar augur well and exerts tremendous pressure on pump prices in the philippines to come down and that is what market forces are all about pressure as a result of the interplay of demand and supply
3865083 maybe we can see another price adjustment at the same rate as last week
3865084 right now what were seeing is the oil companies are setting their prices differently some are increasing prices in diesel decrease in gas etc this affords the consuming public to exercise the power of choice on where they do buy diesel and gasoline and this is a good sign
3865085 our prosecutors went to him and asked him if he would be willing to testify during the trial of the case but he said no
3865086 we heard that he said our prosecutors are welcome to visit him in his office or at home
3865087 so we will try again i will ask our prosecutors to go back to him the prosecution would know what to do he jimenez will just be asked to tell the truth in court and affirm his earlier testimony
3865088 if he has forgiven secretary perez already we respect that
3865089 but this case has become public interest already so we would ask him to just speak the truth before the court
3865090 the motion for desistance was not a denial of what he said in his complaint affidavit
3865091 that only meant that he has forgiven perez already but he did not take back what he said so it still stands
3865092 i was not consulted in the building of this case so i really have reservations on it
3865093 i think the case build up was not thorough for example most of the witnesses they included were from abroad
3865094 threatened and intimidated me and my family with bodily harm and incarceration in a city jail with hardened criminals and drug addicts unless i execute damaging affidavits against president estrada and his cronies and associates
3865095 the bmi has not yet even submitted its report to commandant tamayo but we were told that the office of the ombudsman sent a letter to the bmi and is also asking for a copy of their report they will review the bmis findings to investigate the possible culpability of government offices
3865096 based on the philippine merchant marine rules and regulations pmmrr which ordered the transfer of the bmi to the pcg the bmis jurisdiction only investigates the possible offense of the shipping companies the government personnel are only resource persons and therefore out of their jurisdiction the bmi cannot recommend sanctions against the government agencies
3865097 the office of the ombudsman does not even need to explain why it will investigate
3865098 at some point during the rope line an enthusiastic supporter shook mrs mccains hand and exacerbated an existing carpal tunnel condition
3865099 out of an abundance of caution she decided to leave the event and visit the local hospital for x rays where she was treated for a minor sprain
3865100 we have the most number of destinations in the top 20 list which is dominated by asian and south american countries but we are continually dropping
3865101 by landing in the list of the seven wonders of nature tourism activities near these sites will rise thus benefiting the livelihood of filipinos living nearby
3865102 are four times as likely to get into crashes serious enough to injure themselves passengers and pedestrians as well
3865103 using a cellular phone while driving is analogous to driving while drunk
3865104 this means that 166 road accidents take place in metro manila daily a car bus truck or jeep kills one person almost every day and maims around 30
3865105 the oppositions fear that the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain is a move to amend charter to perpetuate president arroyos continued stay in power beyond 2010 clearly negates their claim that she is an unpopular president
3865106 if shes unpopular then whats the problem of the opposition if she runs again under a new charter
3865107 isnt she an easy rival as such so let her run again and let opposition prove they could defeat her as she is unpopular anyway
3865108 if she is unpopular then why are they afraid of charter change which we really badly need for political and economic development the way opposition accused gma president arroyos initials of planning to run again is an admission that she is still a power to reckon with
3865109 if they know theyll be cheated then they should do something and be prepared for it
3865110 the laws didnt make babies out of the opposition who should always be attended to every time they have fears in their political problems
3865111 if they would allow themselves to be cheated despite their alleged knowledge that they would be then they have no business to be in politics
3865112 if they could not protect their interests how could they protect the interests of the public that they seek to represent
3865113 the president made it clear that as far as filipinos arrested in drug trafficking cases abroad are concerned they cant expect help from the government and i can tell that she is firm on this decision
3865114 you see the government can help those overseas filipinos who commit personal crimes like killing their employer in self defense for instance but in drug cases we know that these are syndicated so we really cant tolerate them
3865115 poor countries will have limited options and lower resilience in relation to climate change impact
3865116 everyone has to take the blame but the governments must have to take the blame for not supplying the technology that provide the scientists access to information
3865117 reporting climate change creating a climate of change in southeast asia
3865118 ultimately the cities hardest hit by climate change will be the ones least prepared
3865119 global warming points towards more frequent and extreme weather events so managers must take action to protect their cities sooner rather than later
3865120 we have seen events like the 2004 tsunami and recently cyclone nargis in myanmar and a typhoon in the philippines
3865121 there is no cookie cutter solution to climate change impacts its important that you are able to anticipate the likely impacts on your city and make the decision to deal with that

3865129 they will not alter the previous department rules that forbid predicating an investigation simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
3865130 his denial of profiling is a bit of a bait and switch he says race will not be the deciding factor in opening investigations but he recently testified that it can be a factor thats a change from the current ban on racial profiling
3865131 we are in agreement with everything except one aspect on this
3865132 in our discussions morgan tsvangirai was agreeable on that aspect and then he changed his mind and asked for an opportunity to reflect and consult and then re engage the process
3865133 after due consideration of all issues as discussed above nec session resolved that the nationwide strike action embarked upon since 28th of june 2008 by all teachers in primary and post primary schools in the country be hereby suspended indefinitely as a mark of honour and respect to all state governors for their intervention
3865134 we cannot call off the strike now because we have just begun a new process on the issue of tss our next focus now would be on the implementation and until we achieve that the strike remains suspended indefinitely
3865135 nec session therefore enjoins the nigeria governors forum to keep faith with the terms letters and spirit of the agreement reached by ensuring full implementation in the overall interest of the educational system in the respective states and the federal capital territory fct
3865136 in hopeful anticipation of the full implementation of the agreements reached with them towards enhancing the fortunes of the teachers the future of the nigerian child and the development of the nations educational system
3865137 i look at our nations economy where it is easier and cheaper to buy finished goods imported from europe than to produce them here and i ask myself those who are still producing here how do they do it he added that one had to have a job first before becoming a casual worker
3865138 as professionals there is what is called job satisfaction we may get all the money but have no place to express ourselves that is why i say we have to look deeper and find ways to ventilate grievances
3865139 if we picket the factories that are barely surviving out of production who do we picket next let us put on our thinking caps now and explore ways to grow this economy this economy must grow it is not in anybodys interest that the companies still producing should shut down
3865140 battle well in order not to hurt the citizenry the more
3865141 in line with its constitutional responsibilities as provided in section 223 and part 1 f of the third schedules of the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria 1999 and section 86 of the electoral act 2006 the commission requests your party to make available detailed schedules for the conduct of the congresses in the affected states and the outcome of the court cases in anambra imo and oyo states
3865142 as we celebrate our achievements these past five years i wish to acknowledge that the birth of globacom and indeed the phenomenal success that it has become are as a result of the conducive environment created by government and the acceptance of the network by the vast majority of nigerians

3865160 this outbreak of hostilities is a very disappointing setback in the peace process hopefully the situation will stabilize so we can resume peacebuilding measures
3865161 management miscalculated amds capability to produce competitive parts in volume and as a result lost significant gross profit dollars and market share
3865162 we believe that much of the bad news is understood and are hopeful that expectations and estimates will be largely reset across the board
3865163 some things we cant control but there are many things we can weve dusted ourselves off and we are now intensely focused on change changes and improvements that will enhance our performance in the future
3865164 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3865165 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose

3865197 shouldnt niita be jumping out right about now with a flame thrower or something
3865198 maybe she isnt here yet or she didnt expect us to crash so shes in one of the other buildings where we were supposed to land which means we should book if we can get to one of those other planes before she finds us
3865199 do you want to split up we could cover more ground that way hurry things along

3865215 this song is a strange one its been buzzing around our sets for years but is better when stripped down to just acoustic guitar piano and drums
3865216 then he showed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord and satan standing at his right hand to oppose him the lord said ot satan the lord rebuke you satan the lord who has chosen jerusalem rebuke you is this not a brand plucked from the fire
3865217 for you have magnified your word above all your name
3865218 and do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
3865219 and i said let them set a fair mitre upon his head so they set a fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of the lord stood by and the angel of the lord protested unto joshua saying thus saith the lord of hosts if thou wilt walk in my ways and if thou wilt keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shalt also keep my courts and i will give thee places to walk among these that stand by hear now o joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men wondered at for behold i will bring forth my servant the branch for behold the stone that i have laid before joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes behold i will engrave the graving thereof saith the lord of hosts and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day in that day saith the lord of hosts shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree
3865220 holiness to the lord exodus 28 36 37 39 30 31
3865221 for the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of god and if it begins with us first what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel
3865222 if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged
3865223 the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner this is the lords doing it is marvellous in our eyes
3865224 sanctify the lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dread and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of israel for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken
3865225 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste
3865226 then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth
3865227 forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure
3865228 i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day
3865229 its very reassuring to believe in some permanent external essence that underlies everything
3865230 while we play out our relative dramas of hope and fear
3865231 now joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the angel then he answered and spoke to those who stood before him saying take away the filthy garments from him and to him he said see i have removed your iniquity from you and i will clothe you with rich robes
3865232 and there shall be like people like priest and i will punish them for their ways and reward them their doings

3865237 the only tinned tuna brand that is fished using sustainable methods
3865238 john west must stop selling tuna caught in this way
3865239 thousands of turtles and sharks are killed every year while catching tuna and john west the biggest tinned tuna seller in the uk is currently the worst supplier of the lot
3865240 unless suppliers and markets take action to source only sustainable products the industry will simply fish itself and our oceans to death
3865241 to put the tuna fishery on a long term sustainable and profitable footing
3865242 we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3865243 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush

3865245 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3865246 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3865247 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital and get away with it
3865248 its time to stop this so that russia can dig out of the hole its gotten itself into
3865249 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe

3865319 9 and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him 10 and it came to pass as jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples 11 and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners 12 but when jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick 13 but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance

3865325 32 this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses
3865326 29 and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchre 30 but god raised him from the dead 31 and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who are his witnesses unto the people
3865327 1 and the apostles and brethren that were in jud a heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god 2 and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him 3 saying thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them 4 but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order unto them saying 5 i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me 6 upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes i considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air 7 and i heard a voice saying unto me arise peter slay and eat 8 but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth 9 but the voice answered me again from heaven what god hath cleansed that call not thou common 10 and this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven 11 and behold immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was sent from c sarea unto me 12 and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the mans house 13 and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simon whose surname is peter 14 who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved 15 and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning 16 then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost 17 forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god 18 when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life 19 now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice and cyprus and antioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only 20 and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when they were come to antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the lord jesus 21 and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord 22 then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should go as far as antioch 23 who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord 24 for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the lord 25 then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul 26 and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in antioch 27 and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch 28 and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the relief unto the brethren which dwelt in jud a 30 which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul
3865328 6 and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter 7 and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe 8 and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us 9 and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith 10 now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear 11 but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they
3865329 20 and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast 21 the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus 22 philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus
3865330 matthew 10 2 b a fisherman called to follow jesus along with john 21 and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them 22 and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him
3865331 the limited 5 these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not 6 but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel 7 and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
3865332 13 and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he would and they came unto him 14and he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach 15 and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils 16 and simon he surnamed peter 17 and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder 18 and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite 19 and judas iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into an house
3865333 11 but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed 12 for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision 13 and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation
3865334 1 now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour 2 and a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple 3 who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms 4 and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us 5 and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them 6 then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk 7 and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength 8 and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god 9 and all the people saw him walking and praising god 10 and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him 11 and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomons greatly wondering 12 and when peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of israel why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk 13 the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go 14 but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you 15 and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses 16 and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all 17 and now brethren i wot that through ignorance ye did it as did also your rulers 18 but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled 19 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord 20 and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you 21 whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began 22 for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you 23 and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people 24 yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days 25 ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which god made with our fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed 26 unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities
3865335 1 and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them 2 being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead 3 and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now eventide 4 howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand 5 and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes 6 and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem 7 and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this 8 then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel 9 if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole 10 be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole 11 this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner 12 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved 13 now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus 14 and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it 15 but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves 16 saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we can not deny it 17 but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name 18 and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus 19 but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye 20 for we can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard 21 so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for that which was done 22 for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewed 23 and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them 24 and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is 25 who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things 26 the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ 27 for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together 28 for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done 29 and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word 30 by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus 31 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness 32 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common 33 and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all 34 neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold 35 and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need 36 and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of cyprus 37 having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet
3865336 1 but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession 2 and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet 3 but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land 4 whiles it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou hast not lied unto men but unto god 5 and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things 6 and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him 7 and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in 8 and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yea for so much 9 then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out 10 then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband 11 and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things 12 and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in solomons porch 13 and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified them 14 and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women 15 insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them 16 there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one 17 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation 18 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison 19 but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said 20 go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life 21 and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought 22 but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told 23 saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within 24 now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto this would grow 25 then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people 26 then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned 27 and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them 28 saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this mans blood upon us 29 then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men 30 the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree to be a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins 32 and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him 33 when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them 34 then stood there up one in the council a pharisee named gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space 35 and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men 36 for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought 37 after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed 38 and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought 39 but if it be of god ye can not overthrow it lest haply ye be found even to fight against god 40 and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go 41 and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name 42 and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ
3865337 1 and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration 2 then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve tables 3 wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business 4 but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word 5 and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of antioch 6 whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them 7 and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith 8 and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people 9 then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians and of them of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen 10 and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake 11 then they suborned men which said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and against god 12 and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council 13 and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law 14 for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which moses delivered us 15 and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel
3865338 18 then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days

3865348 a mighty pain to love it is and tis a pain that pain to miss but of all the pains the greatest pain is to love but love in vain
3865349 you dont marry someone you can live with you marry the person who you cannot live without
3865350 true love is like ghosts which everybody talks about and few have seen
3865351 we perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together
3865352 better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all
3865353 when we are in love we often doubt that which we most believe
3865354 sympathy constitutes friendship but in love there is a sort of antipathy or opposing passion each strives to be the other and both together make up one whole
3865355 there is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists or simulate it where it does not
3865356 a very small degree of hope is sufficient to cause the birth of love
3865357 there is no remedy for love but to love more
3865358 death is a challenge it tells us not to waste time it tells us to tell each other right now that we love each other
3865359 love cures people both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it
3865360 if you love someone let them go if they return to you it was meant to be if they dont their love was never yours to begin with
3865361 true love never dies for it is lust that fades away love bonds for a lifetime but lust just pushes away
3865362 love is not blind it sees more and not less but because it sees more it is willing to see less
3865363 love is like playing the piano first you must learn to play by the rules then you must forget the rules and play from your heart
3865364 within you i lose myself without you i find myself wanting to be lost again
3865365 love is not love that alters when it alteration finds
3865366 if i could reach up and hold a star for every time youve made me smile the entire evening sky would be in the palm of my hand
3865367 love begins with a smile grows with a kiss and ends with a teardrop

3865536 i think japanese handsets were uniquely ahead but such uniqueness may not be so significant
3865537 more and more sophisticated more and more pc like the conventional way of developing handsets will not work any more
3865538 attention attention attention all you ever care about is people paying attention to you you stupid lying bitch
3865539 our old receivables were real high and were a real mess
3865540 rossini werd in eerste instantie niet geselecteerd nu moet hij plots een week voor onze start in de competitie toch naar china vliegen dat zien we niet zitten
3865541 i was certainly not inclined to decriminalise however during my time in the unit as i saw more and more evidence of what works it became apparent to me that enforcement and supply side interventions were largely pointless they have no significant lasting impact on the availability affordability or use of drugs
3865542 august is the wettest and often the muggiest month of the year yet summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
3865543 wind power does not obviate the need for fossil fuel plants which will continue to be indispensable
3865544 the problem is that wind power volatility requires fossil fuel plants to be switched on and off which damages them and means that even more plants will have to be built
3865545 neither these extra costs nor the increased carbon production are being taken into account in uk government figures for wind power
3865546 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
3865547 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
3865548 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
3865549 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
3865550 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
3865551 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
3865552 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
3865553 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3865554 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3865555 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3865556 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3865557 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3865558 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3865559 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3865560 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3865561 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3865562 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3865563 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3865564 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3865565 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3865566 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3865567 take the necessary measures to establish diplomatic relations on the level of embassies in accordance with the united nations charter and international laws

3865569 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives

3865571 were hopeful that it will call upon the government province and city to help people out to do the right thing
3865572 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
3865573 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
3865574 i thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car
3865575 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff
3865576 evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
3865577 stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery

3865589 the democratic party is united and ready to fight for the change our working families so desperately need

3865591 we are united in our support of brian foley and look forward to actively helping elect him to the state senate
3865592 i thank jimmy and our democratic leadership for their support only together united can we end the stranglehold of special interests in albany it is time for change and i look forward to continuing my campaign for the working families of islip and brookhaven

3865595 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3865596 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3865597 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3865598 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3865599 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3865600 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3865601 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3865602 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3865603 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3865604 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3865605 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3865606 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3865607 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3865608 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3865609 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3865610 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3865611 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3865612 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3865613 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3865614 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3865615 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3865616 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3865617 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3865618 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3865619 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3865620 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3865621 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3865622 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3865623 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3865624 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3865625 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3865626 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
3865627 this was another adrenaline spiking near miss situation where with one suspect pointing the pistol at his friends we were fortunate to not have an officer involved shooting
3865628 he also said a friend removed the orange plastic piece from the guns muzzle so it would look more like a real handgun
3865629 officers also talked to the young men about how dangerous it is to walk around in public with something that looks like a real gun
3865630 weve been getting calls from neighbors and people driving by theres a dog trapped on the island
3865631 the geese are very wary of them then eventually they figure it out
3865632 theyre very striking when you first come upon them i could see how it would be for someone driving by at 70 miles per hour
3865633 they dont seem to be doing any good anymore and it appears they are upsetting some people
3865634 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3865635 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3865636 is vulnerable to adversaries who seek information about our nations homeland defense programs classified or unclassified
3865637 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
3865638 if indeed russia is violating a ceasefire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which russia is moving
3865639 i really do believe that the russians understand that pushing the envelope here would have significant consequences for russias standing in the international system
3865640 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3865641 bushs speech said nothing of how georgia was armed all these years including by the united states
3865642 we have more than once warned our partners that this is a dangerous game it the bush speech said nothing about what had happened on aug 8 when western leaders maintained silence when tskhinvali became a target of massive bombing
3865643 the western political elite got excited only after the russian leadership decided not to leave its peacekeepers to their fate not to allow ethnic cleansing as it had happened in srebrenica
3865644 i spoke today with rice and she told me there are reports of acts of looting in gori that illegal groups are looting the city and russian troops are doing nothing
3865645 if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way
3865646 the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3865647 there is russian presence near the towns of gori and senaki we have never concealed this
3865648 they are there to neutralize a huge arsenal of arms and military hardware which they found there totally abandoned
3865649 it was necessary to neutralize them in order not to create a threat for civilians
3865650 the west is just filling up and more people are going out to use public lands than ever before
3865651 so conflict management is probably something thats here to stay
3865652 non economic damages are a small percentage of total losses paid capping non economic damages will show loss savings of 1 0
3865653 wir benachrichtigen die kunden und bitten sie beim n chsten werkstattaufenthalt die sitzbelegungsmatte austauschen zu lassen
3865654 this decision was made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our portfolio and enables us to maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
3865655 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father
3865656 i virtually had no hope of ever knowing what happened to my dad
3865657 i wouldnt say ive processed it i think im still a little shell shocked by it all
3865658 i dont know that the military even looked for him
3865659 i guess they figured he was gone and thats about it
3865660 eu realmente acho que dever amos trabalhar juntos em rela o ao marketing como j hav amos conversado mesmo sendo competidores n s temos o mesmo objetivo de manter nossa categoria bem posicionada respeitadas as qualidades 5 e 8 de diferen a s o uma mostra de desrespeito
3865661 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3865662 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3865663 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3865664 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3865665 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3865666 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3865667 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3865668 the vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the processing of torrent files this can be exploited to cause a stack based buffer overflow by tricking the user into opening a torrent file containing an overly long created by field
3865669 guidelines for scientific exhibits and poster displays application production and presentation
3865670 what is more some fault may creep into the administration of either doctrine or sacraments but this ought not to estrange us from communion with the church i say that we must not thoughtlessly forsake the church because of any petty dissensions for in it alone is kept safe and uncorrupted that doctrine in which piety stands sound and the use of the sacraments ordained by the lord is guarded in the meantime if we try to correct what displeases us we do so out of duty pauls statement applies to this if a better revelation is made to another sitting by let the first be silent from this it is clear that every member of the church is charged with the responsibility of public edification according to the measure of his grace provided he perform it decently and in order that is we are neither to renounce the communion of the church nor remaining in it to disturb its peace and duly ordered discipline
3865671 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
3865672 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
3865673 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign
3865674 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far
3865675 theres not much enemy left in iraq but theres plenty of enemy here to be dealt with
3865676 theres a discussion underway only if the decision is made to replace them what we will insist on is that it be a full up capacity
3865677 we dont want another force in there that isnt fully adaptive for what we think were going to face
3865678 say this draw down in iraq works and marines are made free then weve got to train marines for afghanistan as opposed to going to iraq that takes time that takes four or five months
3865679 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
3865680 they smile at you while they dig a grave for you behind your back
3865681 mooommm spencer kicked me in the eye and he did it on purpose
3865682 we have a good team when its not playing like this
3865683 you go out there and play with showboating if we dont take care of these things were going to have a lot of problems
3865684 the last five minutes with the 50 60 000 chanting u s a it was quite a feeling about what it means to be in these tournaments
3865685 we were very close even when we play with 10 men we never give up
3865686 there was a big scene from the nigerian player but i dont know we didnt expect this kind of reaction its kind of unacceptable
3865687 going out raving linking up with my people linking up with my gal looking after my kids and walking the dog ive just been having fun living
3865688 looking back on it now at the time council estate of mind came out i dont really think there was anyone else out there acting as a voice for the frustrations of the youth and speaking on the social conditions they were living in
3865689 outside of my core audience some of the flattery i received from highly regarded critics in publications like
3865690 ive always been a great believer in charity and that was something i was first really made aware of by one of my heroes sir bob geldof back when i was young and he was doing things like live aid
3865691 seeing what was achieved through the power of music back then with live aid was something that really struck me
3865692 as i was making my way to the stage i came across this area with a big screen showing the work wateraid were doing to help the children in africa by giving them clean water
3865693 it also made me realise that with all of the problems the lower working class has to deal with here in the uk were still blessed in many ways with things like the nhs schools and pensions for the elderly
3865694 so if anyone wants to come rob me for the money they think ive got its already gone what you gonna kill me for my moneys been sent to those children across the world who need our help
3865695 i believe its a personal choice that one has to make i myself feel that ive been given the responsibility i feel that even if you dont think youre a role model you already are a role model because youre in the spotlight and people will be looking up to you now whether you want to be a good role model or a bad role model is up to the individual personally im motivated to make music so i can be a voice of the people and be someone that people can learn from rather than doing it to obtain superstardom or for any other reason
3865696 its the exact same energy i remember for example when i used to hear onyx slam and as soon as i heard the opening bars of that riddim my face would be screwing up and id have a big vein on my forehead the music just gave me that feeling and thats exactly what these kids are doing at the moment with grime i feel the exact same energy from these grime kids today as i used to get from the hip hop scene back then its the same thing and i really cant find a difference between the two i love it and its a beautiful evolution
3865697 yes theres definitely something in the pipeline thats under construction for presentation next year
3865698 the cover art i have in mind will depict the united nations leaders riding around the globe on a carousel
3865699 whereas council estate of mind was dealing with issues i was seeing in my immediate surroundings the new album will be dealing with bigger subject matter on a world scale
3865700 im probably going to oversee the production myself but as far as featured artists are concerned i would love to be able to work with chuck d and dead prez and also reach out to someone like shabazz the disciple
3865701 in the meantime im going to be releasing the smoking ban ep which is going to contain material that i felt didnt suit council estate of mind and that wouldnt suit the new album either its still material that i believe my fans will appreciate so why not give it to them the ep will have about ten or twelve tracks on there like warriors chant lady heroin and of course smoking ban its gonna be a lot im also doing an ep with mc trip called horrorcore and were going to be spitting some grimy lyrics over acid house
3865702 yeah i even want to sample shut up amp dance were going to be on some hip house vibe like doug lazy and fast eddie laughs my music will be going in all directions from now on as i dont have to stay focused on establishing myself as a hip hop artist anymore because ive done that now
3865703 back in the day when jungle was blowing up and you had emcees like navigator and creed i was thinking i can do this but it means ill buss as a junglist emcee and i didnt want to do that
3865704 i had to bite my tongue in nuff dances when i wanted to jump on the mic because i knew id be labelled as a jungle emcee and it was very important to me to come up under hip hop but now that ive done that i feel like i can branch out and do anything i want because ive already got the backpackers with me
3865705 i want to encourage everyone to make a donation of any kind to www wateraid org and i also want to say sorry that theres been such a long gap in my creativity since council estate of mind but the fire is burning strong once again
3865706 today blood is being shed and people are perishing in south ossetia and my heart deeply grieves over it orthodox christians are among those who have raised their hands against each other orthodox peoples called by the lord to live in fraternity and love are in conflict
3865707 respect the traditions views and hopes of the georgian and ossetian peoples
3865708 god is with us and the virgin mary is protecting us but one thing concerns us very deeply that orthodox russians are bombing orthodox georgians

3865752 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3865753 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit

3865764 if i said i was running for eight years im not sure that would be a vote getter
3865765 a idea to serve one term had long been discussed among top advisers
3865766 rod smith was one of the best all around players i played with in the nfl and i only got play with him when he was too old and too slow laughing he was the undisputed leader of the team which took a lot of pressure off of me the standard rod set was high and he led by example the game will miss a player like rod smith
3865767 probably one of the most impressive things ive ever seen him do was in my first year there i had just gotten hurt and we didnt have a back up for a couple of days so they had him take 7 on 7 i think he was 6 for 6 and it wasnt like he was dumping to the back or hitting the checkdown he was throwing a skinny route dead on hed throw a go route he threw an out route i was thinking good god hed be good enough to take my job if he spent a year working on it it was sick
3865768 why i felt so good around him is physically he didnt look like anything hed walk kind of sideways he sometimes had this high type voice i mean he didnt look like a professional receiver when you put him next to terrell owens but the things he didnt do well he worked on its hard to pick between them but rod and larry centers had the two best sets of hands ive ever seen
3865769 he knew he was willing to do anything and everything he had to do to make the team it was a pact we made during our rookie orientation that we were here for work it was good to meet new guys new friends but when we leave here you never know whats going to happen
3865770 he was not only a great player but a great teammate he was a guy that was great for the city great for the organization and a guy that worked his tail off i mean the guy came in as a free agent it shows you what hes all about he was not only a great football player but a class act he was a guy you could rely on week in and week out
3865771 you are the greatest player next to john elway to play for me and if ever get anybody like you are like john again i am very fortunate
3865772 rod is the only person ive been around on a consistent basis day in day out that never cared about his stats all rod smith talked about was winning when you have a guy that talks about winning consistently regardless of any number of catchers or any honors anyone who is able to influence the locker room like he has then you have a chance to do something special
3865773 hes been playing way less than 100 percent for a long long time
3865774 it has limited him a lot in practice hes going to come back better than hes ever been
3865775 freedoms of expression and information dont just apply to foreign journalists and international ngos ordinary chinese web users who number more than in any other country in the world still endure internet repression web sites are blocked searches are filtered with the help of global companies like google microsoft and yahoo
3865776 who are less focused on human rights and dissent than international viewers the grandeur of the arenas and the ceremonies and chinas medal count are what domestic journalists and broadcasts and their target audiences focus on and if all goes smoothly in beijing that may still be what international audiences remember most about the 2008 games
3865777 journalistic freedom at any time is a relative but not absolute conception
3865778 china regulates the internet according to law the chinese laws forbid anyone to spread illegal information such as preaching an evil cult like the falungong or do anything that harms national interests through the internet
3865779 the games have come to highlight not only the awesome achievements of the country but also the grave shortcomings of the current regime
3865780 record is poor when it comes to transparency official accountability and the rule of law it has responded clumsily to internal and external political challenges by initially ignoring the international communitys desire for china to play a more active role in resolving the human rights crisis in darfur arresting prominent chinese political activists and cracking down violently on demonstrators
3865781 the party has adapted and navigated its way forward loosening its grip on elements of society even as it crushes or co opts threats to its hold on political power
3865782 leaders and officials at every level will begin to relax after months if not years of preoccupation with this event olympic security restrictions will be removed dissidents will stick their heads up again debates spawned by chinas recent crises are likely to become less fettered
3865783 this is very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp

3865814 we cant be overcritical of american publishers for cowering under terrorist threats after all the guardian like every other british newspaper lacked the gumption to publish the danish cartoons but all who care about free speech have a duty to make this sort of censorship counterproductive random house should pay this author substantial compensation and the book should be placed on a website so everyone can read it
3865815 might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3865816 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book

3865855 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3865856 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose
3865857 russian incursions into georgia from south ossetia or from abkhazia are contrary to international law
3865858 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
3865859 reports spread by the western media about movement of russian troops on georgian territory towards tbilisi and also about looting in gori have absolutely no foundations whatsoever
3865860 i thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car
3865861 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff
3865862 evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
3865863 stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery

3865890 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3865891 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3865892 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3865893 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3865894 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3865895 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3865896 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3865897 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive

3865912 tragically zimbabwe has become one of the worst man made humanitarian disasters of a new and hopeful century
3865913 because of the failed policies of zanu pf five million zimbabweans now face starvation and famine we cannot allow this to happen
3865914 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3865915 there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
3865916 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership
3865917 because i say youre a terrorist you have to stay in jail as long as i want without any access to due process
3865918 for seven years uniformed military officers have pushed back against the administrations most extreme and unlawful detention and interrogation policies only to be overruled by white house lawyers with little respect for the constitution or geneva conventions
3865919 we may never know what the commission members were thinking but we saw what they did they ensured that mr hamdans fate will be determined by a future administration with more respect for the rule of law
3865920 in the strange world of guant namo justice even if hamdan had been acquitted on all charges he would have been detained indefinitely nowhere else in the u s justice system can someone be held for life regardless of whether he is convicted or acquitted of a crime todays outcome represents nothing more than an illusion of justice it is time to shut down these commissions and put an end to this shameful chapter in american history

3865923 instead republicans have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3865924 would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling

3865959 republicans stay for shadow session if capitol hill ever is sleepy it is during the annual august recess not so for everyone last week even though congress was out of session
3865960 i ts likely that when speaker pelosi closed congress for its august recess house members went home and got an earful
3865961 house democrats vacationing away from capitol hill to argue as the democrats do that the united states should forgo future sources of oil and gas because they produce no energy today is illogical and ridiculous on its face should the
3865962 republican revolt resonating back home the earned media success story constituents back home are paying attention and want their congressman to act on the high cost of energy with the c span cameras turned off on the u s house floor and the presidential race overshadowing the revolt on cable news its somewhat hard to gauge the impact its having in congressional districts across well let me tell you its having a significant impact back home judging from media coverage in local press the following is a summary of the news coverage in republican districts
3865963 i represent a poor rural district in alabama 4 a gallon gas is not an option in our lives
3865964 this high energy price trend will not end because india and china have over a billion folks now they have money and now they want energy
3865965 renewable energy is our future the budget is 3 trillion a year of that we spend only 1 8 billion on research and development of renewable energy this shows we arent committed to renewable energy
3865966 we have had 105 republican members of congress come here in the last 9 days to speak not one democrat has joined us not even to debate
3865967 we have to end our moratorium on offshore drilling we are the only industrialized nation not going after their offshore resources
3865968 one of my democrat colleagues from the northwest coast said 10 a gallon gas was great because thats what it would take to make americans switch to green energy in the heartland i know 10 a gallon gas means joblessness and destitution
3865969 we live in a changing world without leadership on the energy issue we face a bleak time

3865992 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3865993 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3865994 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
3865995 john mccain shot from the hip a very aggressive very belligerent statement
3865996 its just an example they politicize these issues without understanding that national security is not something thats a political issue same thing with the surge its in keeping with sort of the path that theyve been on to politicize national security for their perceived short term political interests
3865997 well im more concerned about the situation there number one number two is people will make their own judgment but

3866068 i know but what if we could get non ford owners to say how much they love our cars without them actually buying one
3866069 well well track down some average americans the shittier their car the better if they drive a gm or a toyota even better well lend them one of our brand new top of the line automobiles for a week im talking the best editions with the in dash video screens and leather interiors you know the 60k models
3866070 i think i see where youre going with this but go on
3866071 well lend them these cars then take them back and then have them look into a camera and say how much they enjoyed the ford experience its fool proof
3866072 youre right american buyers will eat it up because theyre idiots theyll never realize that weve taken someones shitty horrible takes three good hard turns of the key to start cars with the paint peeling off of them and replaced it with a brand new 2008 model of one of our pricier models this is genius
3866073 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3866074 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3866075 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3866076 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3866078 revenue increased 28 gross profit margin increased from 61 to 66 and operating expenses decreased 31 in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007 these positive achievements resulted in net income for the second quarter of 2008
3866079 the growth in revenue and profit in the second quarter was primarily driven by the 2 5 million of orders booked in the first half of the year we entered the third quarter with a backlog of 1 0 million
3866080 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3866081 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3866082 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3866083 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3866084 for the last decade british politics has been dominated by ministers who represent poorer urban areas and the new labour government has invested heavily in urban regeneration
3866085 a future conservative administration more representative of suburbs and the south would most probably have a very different set of priorities
3866086 no government has done more to turn around decades of neglect and since 1997 cities like manchester liverpool and newcastle have benefited from thousands of new jobs lower crime rates and better living standards thanks to our sustained commitment to regeneration and investment in public services
3866087 its alarming that this think tank is labelling our great cities as beyond revival and arguing that we should target less effort on them when those areas that have received regeneration funding have shown the greatest improvements
3866088 the whole world steps aside for the man who knows where he is going
3866089 consistent with our strategy to focus on our core competencies which include growing our portfolio of publishing businesses and building multi platform communities of customers based on our branded content
3866090 a growing area for subscriptions across the magazine publishing industry
3866091 i think it is great that a publishing company owns them rather than a company outside of our business i think that time inc will have a greater incentive to see that qsp continues to be an important source of subscriptions for the industry
3866092 it is my understanding that school plan subscriptions have always been considered quality circulation by advertisers they reach an important demographic group and there is no question about the sales tactics involved with this source
3866093 ive always thought of qsp as a high quality subscription agent and at a positive remit no less consumers are actively choosing your publication which i think is of value to advertisers
3866094 we think time inc will eventually ruin this good business because theyll structure deals so heavily in favor of time inc titles that all others will eventually leave
3866095 qsp remains its own business proposition in a competitive fundraising market and presumably wants to operate in a way that maximizes profit not time inc subs
3866096 whats more worrisome are potential uses a giant multi title publisher like time inc could derive from the subscription data
3866097 will it be used to mail offers to competing titles will qsps purchase data be used to enhance time inc models

3866175 yes i can play as fast and fancy as any of those snotty showoffs i just usually choose not to
3866176 of course the poor have health care they can just go to the emergency room
3866177 the key question is who benefits from this oh yeah the for profit health insurers and managed care companies who can deny yet more benefits close the risk pool to all but the young and healthy and create ever higher return on investment to shareholders
3866178 close the risk pool to all but the young and healthy
3866179 so far many countries have managed to progressively control the virus and the global situation has improved tremendously
3866180 unfortunately at the global scale many outbreaks remain under reported or unreported national or international bodies are often not in a position to immediately verify rumours or reports about unconfirmed outbreaks
3866181 it will probably take several years to contain and finally eradicate the h5n1 virus from the poultry sector
3866182 fao is concerned about these new flare ups demonstrating that the virus continues to persist in asia as well as other counties
3866183 its a worry not just to the countries but to the international community
3866184 socializing good bio security is a much more effective way to deal with bird flu outbreak
3866185 i think japanese handsets were uniquely ahead but such uniqueness may not be so significant
3866186 more and more sophisticated more and more pc like the conventional way of developing handsets will not work any more
3866187 weve still got a few days left of the window hopefully well get a result
3866188 definitely he is going to stay with us the coach schuster has said he wants him in our team
3866189 we dont see any possibility of robinho leaving real madrid
3866190 it would be a dream for me to work with luiz felipe scolari who is one of the best coaches in the world
3866191 a key issue over buying robinho has always been that real are looking for a replacement

3866198 were all equals in this team but of course i make the final decisions
3866199 someone thought up a vague idea for a client server multiplayer game
3866200 designed implemented tested deployed and live being played by thousands of people
3866201 enough to make it look like you actually wrote anything at all in those two months
3866202 switch it off and switch it on again at least once a day automatically
3866203 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father
3866204 i virtually had no hope of ever knowing what happened to my dad
3866205 i wouldnt say ive processed it i think im still a little shell shocked by it all
3866206 i think they kind of grasp what is going on
3866207 i dont know that the military even looked for him
3866208 i guess they figured he was gone and thats about it
3866209 im just so proud of him and what he did for his country
3866210 anything i can do to see he gets the honors he deserves thats what im working for
3866211 i am fighting for my heritage and my rights as a southerner and an american
3866212 if he had worn at clinton high what he wore at anderson high it would have been a riot somebody would have clobbered him
3866213 challenging the system he knew the dress code his father knew the dress code he signed the dress code he was challenging it
3866214 i felt like i was the one who stood up for
3866215 no child should have to go though something like this they are playing with toys they shouldnt be harmed because of it
3866216 there was no way i was going to buy my children a toy again
3866217 this bill represents the most significant improvements to product safety since congress created the cpsc in the 1970s
3866218 congress responded to the wishes of parents and children all across america and passed legislation that will help restore our confidence in the safety of our toys and everyday products
3866219 god has blessed us with our son being ok and now gave me a tool to say we need to have this stopped
3866220 its not ok for lead to be in childrens toys
3866221 ive been a hunter all my life just looking at the tracks its a big one
3866222 ive been around mountain lions and this is extremely abnormal
3866223 we tend to get involved when we have repeated sightings in town
3866224 it depends on where the animal is and the behavior of the animal
3866225 if we started seeing a succession of sightings or pets disappearing or if a person came face to face with a mountain lion or if one is showing aggressive behavior then an officer might decide something needs to be done
3866226 i gave these a b because it does what it says it will in terms of preserving your fruit and vegetables a little longer but it didnt make that much of a difference these bags kept my bananas fresh for about four to five days longer than a traditional bag and for about a week longer than no bag at all the strawberries made it three days longer in the green bags than with the plastic carton they came in after two weeks i noticed no real difference in my lettuce or tomatoes they do keep things fresher but not by such a huge margin that its worth my extra money for the bags
3866227 debbie meyer firmly stands by her product debbie meyer greenbags
3866228 i ended up giving this a c because they said you could make a coffee handle so i tried that and it broke right off it did a good job in terms of connecting two irrigation pipes and it worked and prevented water seepage but it didnt give me a lot of confidence it didnt seem to be a money saver for me i used the putty to make a handle for my coffee cup but even after allowing the putty to harden completely the handle came off the cup and my mug broke
3866229 mighty putty is an effective and powerful bonding epoxy stick the formula has been used successfully for over 10 years the instructions state that the product must be mixed for two minutes until it is a white color and must be allowed to fully cure for up to 24 hours when the instructions on the package are followed mighty putty is effective as advertised
3866230 i gave them a c the reason being theres a logic issue here it didnt really work on heavy objects it only worked on light objects and you dont really need the help for light objects i couldnt move a heavy chest of drawers on it at all and i tried to move my old jeep and it did not budge at all these make moving furniture on carpet easier for smaller items the moving men coasters did seem to reduce friction and make it easier for me to push or pull items into place but for really heavy things on hardwood floors i didnt get much help from the moving men and the whole point is that theyre supposed to help you move heavy things
3866231 i gave it a c the idea is that it allows you to use your computer and plug a regular phone into your computer to use the internet so it feels like youre using a regular phone overall it works ok with decent call quality with some delay and a few drop outs and its pretty easy to get it up and running the average phone bill for u s residents is 40 a month using the magic jack you pay 40 for the product plus 6 95 for shipping and handling which includes a year of free local and long distance calling to u s and canadian numbers after that its 20 a year so its technically cheaper than a landline the cons if youre the kind of person like me who doesnt want to miss a call and want them to go to voice mail you would have to pay the electricity costs to keep your computer on and that could raise your bill the 911 function is a little confusing to set up if you dont set up 911 the dispatcher wont know your address if you call it just didnt seem to measure up to what they promise
3866232 overheat it to the point the machine starts a high pitched emergency beeping having got within spitting distance of the point that intel cpus become permanently damaged
3866233 best of the things you need and appreciate including all the small touches
3866234 were going to dig more into comparison ranking systems by focusing on competitive rankings and looking more in depth at elo chess ranking system and the other systems that we briefly mentioned previously our goal is to explicate these systems to better address their flaws to begin detailing the purposes of ranking systems and to show how those purposes are critical in the design of ranking systems
3866235 you never stood in that man shoes or saw things thru his eyes or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies so help your brother along the way no matter where he starts for the same god that made you made him too these men with broken hearts
3866236 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
3866237 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
3866238 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign
3866239 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far
3866240 weve been getting calls from neighbors and people driving by theres a dog trapped on the island
3866241 the geese are very wary of them then eventually they figure it out
3866242 theyre very striking when you first come upon them i could see how it would be for someone driving by at 70 miles per hour
3866243 they dont seem to be doing any good anymore and it appears they are upsetting some people
3866244 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3866245 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3866246 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3866247 while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3866248 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3866249 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3866250 this is like something you would see in new york or pennsylvania or california but not here
3866251 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3866252 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3866253 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3866254 often widely attended public events are a riders way into the system
3866255 they get on it for the first time and say hey this is kind of neat i wouldnt mind doing this every day that could be a problem
3866256 basically all federal money is in jeopardy they dont mess around
3866257 wed have to find a parking spot close because thats hard on us older folks to walk far
3866258 its a little bit better for us to ride than to walk
3866259 why should taxpayers subsidize for profit organizations like professional sports teams that can well afford to pay for shuttle services
3866260 transit agencies have historically charged less than market rates for its charter services because of the federal subsidy and usually another subsidy from the event sponsor this has put transit agencies in direct competition with private charter operators for these services and transit agencies always win because public subsidized transit agency rates are lower
3866261 if anything this is going to be a win win for game day ridership because you have true market competition delivering the bus service at the best price
3866262 the system that theyve set up now what weve seen is it allows a very small distinct portion of the private operators to really skew the industry
3866263 what were being told by this regulation is we cant do it anymore
3866264 weve got to turn it over what were trying to do is make sure its turned over in as effective a manner as we can would we like to be able to continue to do it absolutely
3866265 i dont want to beat a dead horse here but i think its going to be very difficult for them to have to make a profit and charge a reasonable price
3866266 nu stiu sa scriu si ce as mai scrie mai bine mi aplec inima sa si lase amprenta aici pe h rtie
3866267 traiesc cu sentimentul ca pot triumfa in multe domenii si ca pot deveni un om marcant al istoriei ce o vor citi nepotii mei insa lenea ma impinge sa traiesc viata unui simplu muritor dar am de gand sa schimb asta
3866268 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace
3866269 rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
3866270 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3866271 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl cable modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3866272 if you have a modchip you also need patchmii in addition to the dvdx stub installer
3866273 wasnt there talk about how only some modchips needed a patched ios do all modchips really need a patched ios
3866274 ironically the ones that do a better job of emulating a real wii disc are the ones that need the modified ios modchip vendors can easily identify compatibility by checking wether or not they set the 0 10 flag in the 0 8576 d2a dms memory location yaosm has been tested as working d2ckey is most likely not supported and openwii has been tested as not supported
3866275 turning off the dvdvideo flag just for 0xa4 means no patchmii
3866276 vladimir putin is a shining example of what a great countries leader should be
3866277 its disrespect for democracy sovereignty and its love of aggression now disqualify it entirely
3866278 america stood by for the first part of ww2 and held our coat while we rolled up our sleeves and got on with it single handed
3866279 the american can always be counted on to do the right thing after they have exhausted all the alternatives
3866280 only america has the muscle the will and the sense of leadership to deal with this
3866281 invasion of another sovereign nation in the 21st century is not something that civilized nations do
3866282 i looked into his eyes and saw an honest man
3866283 i turned my head and looked into his ear and saw daylight
3866284 america loathes the eu because it represents more than a trading block mr heffer is just an american stooge russians take the eu more seriously than the bush cheyney military industrial complex alliance
3866285 superpower invades oil rich country to free people from their lunatic leader
3866286 can we accept that anyone who comments on this board automatically declares him herself to be a raving nutter present writer excepted of course
3866287 it may seem trivial but g8 membership has become the symbol of russias place in the world its disrespect for democracy sovereignty and its love of aggression now disqualify it entirely
3866288 can we all simply accept that anyone who comments on this board automatically declares him herself to be a raving nutter
3866289 russias relationship with the civilised world will now be altered
3866290 russias relationship with the non civilised world will now be altered
3866291 russia is today ruled by gangsters murderers thieves and despots
3866292 how dare these people attempt to assert national sovereignty over their national territory
3866293 for all its idiosyncracies and shortcomings russia is a deeply european culture
3866294 you can talk about 1938 you can talk about 1914 you can even if you want to show off talk about 1811 12
3866295 today i fancy invading ukraine the grub grows well there

3866299 hallo children i am quite the cleverest man on the planet and i can bring down a butterfly at 6 feet with my pea shooter
3866300 only one set of utterances will have given the russians pause for thought and only just and that is what the americans are saying
3866301 and that is what the bush administration and republican party are saying
3866302 we must do something this is something therefore we must do this
3866303 president bush has called a 21st century fashion but in an early 19th century one
3866304 its disrespect for democracy sovereignty and its love of aggression now disqualify it entirely
3866305 in past decades some of the people in the united states have questioned whether america should be engaged in the world weve had strains of isolationism in our country which we are all aware of
3866306 would stealth bombers have blackened the skies over moscow would 2 para be driving the russian bear back into north ossetia
3866307 it may seem trivial but g8 membership has become the symbol of russias place in the world
3866308 its disrespect for democracy sovereignty and its love of aggression now disqualify it entirely
3866309 but has nato led by the americans considered what use they would serve

3866317 i saw this game on other portal and other portal but i wasnt going to invest the time playing it until it came to kong and got badges
3866318 web 2 0 its not about technology its about people people now drrive the distribution rather than using broadcast media as the challenge
3866319 design what happens on the couch not what happens in the game on the screen
3866320 story separates the game world from the other narrative arts
3866321 it could very well be said there are only seven types of games
3866322 its clear the glory days of inventing entirely new genres are fading away
3866323 as the industry moves forward great story will be the single unifying trait that will separate the good games from the great ones
3866324 the fantasy of integrating rich complex stories with first rate gameplay is now a reality
3866325 who you should hire for your story driven single player game
3866326 for me a good game is always about making choice
3866327 i dont have any problem with mao or stalin or the vietnamese leaders or certainly fidel locking up people they see as dangerous because so often dissidence has been used by the greater powers to undermine a peoples revolution
3866328 how to get started making a living as an artist
3866329 do you make a living with your art how did you make the jump to being a full time artist
3866330 they despise us they hate every little thing about us
3866331 in short we can provide them with a widely available accurate operational picture when they need it where they need it
3866332 our workplace safety expertise from multiple disciplines allows us to support the u s navy from the initial issue examination through project completion
3866333 reputation systems have driven the entire business at ebay com much of the business at amazon com drives activity at digg com powers the moderation system at slashdot etc and yet for all the millions of words written about web design very few of them have been dedicated to this type of software
3866334 this is nothing special in many ways but in one aspect its the best thing ive ever seen
3866335 we think you are really awful at some things but really good at others please do less of the bad stuff
3866336 reputation and ranking systems for online games and web games
3866337 for instance easy example look at kongregate kong has 5 independent parallel rating systems for each game and 7 reputation systems for each user player developer on the site
3866338 i dont mean to sound dramatic here but i think this is the most dramatic foreign policy event since sept 11
3866339 this will fundamentally change how countries think about how theyre going to provide security in the decades ahead
3866340 set a whole new direction for the west and nato in terms of relations with russia
3866341 i think they will find that this is one point where russias really not going to back down
3866342 if it was good for kosovo to become independent why would it not be good for south ossetia to become independent
3866343 they see him with some justification as sort of a western installed puppet somebody who is always going to be an enemy and who is in a crucial strategic spot for them
3866344 theres a feeling natos been on the offensive for years so this is about reversing the losses
3866345 they really do see america as treating them as an enemy eight years ago when u
3866346 i think russias given up trying to integrate with the west
3866347 i read what you had to say about those places i mean the secret
3866348 kita harus menegakkan hak asasi manusia di indonesia apa pun persoalannya yang harus dihadapi oh ya tentu saya akan meminta wiranto dengan bahasa yang halus meminta dia untuk mengundurkan diri saat saya pulang dan tidak terlalu khawatir dengan reaksi yang mungkin muncul dari pihak militer terhadap pemberhentian wiranto itu mereka akan mematuhi saya
3866349 sepanjang pengumuman komisi penyelidik pelanggaran ham di timor timur adalah untuk upaya penegakan hukum maka tni sama sekali tak keberatan namun tni tidak ingin jika niat penegakan hukum tersebut ditempuh dengan cara melanggar hukum apalagi jika isunya dijadikan komoditas politik dengan cara mengorbankan nama nama sejumlah perwira tinggi
3866350 tni tidak pernah memberikan toleransi kepada anggotanya untuk melakukan tindakan apapun yang bersifat melanggar hukum
3866351 hanya sedikit elit tni yang menentang saya sedangkan 90 persen lainnya mendukung pemerintahan hasil pemilu 1999 saya enjoy dengan dukungan 90 persen personil tni dan saya selalu optimis tak pernah berpikir negatif kadangkala bahkan saya sering disebut terlalu idealis
3866352 siapa yang mau kudeta seharusnya lihat sejarah bahwa selama ini tni tidak pernah melakukan kudeta berita tersebut tidak benar dan bertujuan ingin memojokkan dan menjatuhkan tni
3866353 seluruh rangkaian kejahatan terhadap kemanusiaan tersebut merupakan tanggung jawab tiga kelompok pelaku yakni para pelaku yang secara langsung berada di lapangan yakni para milisi aparat militer dan kepolisian mereka yang melaksanakan pengendalian operasi termasuk tetapi tidak terbatas pada aparat birokrasi sipil terutama para bupati gubernur dan pimpinan militer serta kepolisian lokal pemegang tanggung jawab kebijakan keamanan nasional termasuk tetapi tidak terbatas pada para pejabat tinggi militer baik secara aktif maupun pasif telah terlibat dalam kejahatan tersebut keseluruhan kejahatan terhadap kemanusiaan di timor timur langsung atau tidak langsung terjadi karena kegagalan panglima tni dalam menjamin keamanan dari pelaksanaan pengumuman dua opsi oleh pemerintah struktur kepolisian yang pada waktu itu masih dibawah komando menteri pertahanan telah turut memperlemah kemampuan aparat kepolisian dalam melaksanakan tugas pengamanan berdasarkan perjanjian new york untuk itu jendral tni wiranto selaku panglima tni adalah pihak yang harus diminta pertanggungjawabannya

3866653 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3866654 the obama campaign has had zero policy prescriptions for dealing with the most serious global crisis since the iraq war
3866655 it made obama look like a deer caught in the headlights the mccain campaign was way ahead of him by advocating a serious and multilayered global diplomatic response
3866656 mccain certainly impresses me with the way he has handled it
3866657 it vindicates the somewhat tougher line toward the russians that he has advocated mccain is the one who has distinguished himself here

3866666 we came to fight since our old neighbour thinks that it can fight us
3866667 this country thinks that old times will come back but that time is over everyone knows that the next one could be ukraine then poland

3866671 georgian forces have begun their pullback toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3866672 with the goal of demilitarizing the zone adjacent to the conflict and likewise with the goal of guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population russian peacekeepers are removing these vehicles and munitions
3866673 well frankly some of the first statements from washington were perceived by the russians almost as a green light for doing this because they were too soft russians dont understand that kind of soft language

3866683 did not offer or give the obamas a discount on the house price on the basis of or in relation to the price offered and accepted on the lot
3866684 in the course of the negotiation over the sales price
3866685 stipulated that the closing dates for the two properties were to be the same
3866686 fair they gave 1 6th of the price rita paid which off the top of my head was about 105 000 times 6 about 630 000 which looked to me like the difference of the 300 000 the obamas paid less than the asking price
3866687 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3866688 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door if this proposed regulation had been in place
3866689 its ridiculous to admit that something is endangered because of climate change and then say the esa doesnt apply to climate change
3866690 this rule change gives those agencies carte blanche to do what they want

3866694 were in a dry spell right now and thats having a detrimental effect on the corn crop were probably losing 5 yield per day were waiting for rain right now
3866695 right now the plants are cutting back on second ears theyll fall off if this continues the plants will then abort kernels from the cob and lower that yield
3866696 corn yields hay all the crops were terrible and we had a lot of expense with no return fertilizer prices have gone from 280 dollars per ton to 1000 dollars per ton this year its like a dagger through the heart the increased cost along with fuel being double as it is makes it really important that we recoup these costs and have a good harvest we need a soaking rain right now something that would give us a little reserve
3866697 yesterday was a great albeit very busy day istock provided us with several models as we broke into groups of 5 6 photographers and a creative director and headed out to separate shooting locations
3866698 a healthy glow does not mean a tan and i think thats what we have to clear up a healthy glow is your skin tone glowing you looking luminous
3866699 everybody is pretty much changing their opinion of how great a tan is now i think women just want to look healthy
3866700 everybody just wants to have fresh skin everybody just wants to glow if youve got healthy fresh skin enjoy that and go with your own glow
3866701 to double your rate of sucess you need to double your rate of failure
3866702 i gave these a b because it does what it says it will in terms of preserving your fruit and vegetables a little longer but it didnt make that much of a difference these bags kept my bananas fresh for about four to five days longer than a traditional bag and for about a week longer than no bag at all the strawberries made it three days longer in the green bags than with the plastic carton they came in after two weeks i noticed no real difference in my lettuce or tomatoes they do keep things fresher but not by such a huge margin that its worth my extra money for the bags
3866703 debbie meyer firmly stands by her product debbie meyer greenbags
3866704 i ended up giving this a c because they said you could make a coffee handle so i tried that and it broke right off it did a good job in terms of connecting two irrigation pipes and it worked and prevented water seepage but it didnt give me a lot of confidence it didnt seem to be a money saver for me i used the putty to make a handle for my coffee cup but even after allowing the putty to harden completely the handle came off the cup and my mug broke
3866705 mighty putty is an effective and powerful bonding epoxy stick the formula has been used successfully for over 10 years the instructions state that the product must be mixed for two minutes until it is a white color and must be allowed to fully cure for up to 24 hours when the instructions on the package are followed mighty putty is effective as advertised
3866706 i gave them a c the reason being theres a logic issue here it didnt really work on heavy objects it only worked on light objects and you dont really need the help for light objects i couldnt move a heavy chest of drawers on it at all and i tried to move my old jeep and it did not budge at all these make moving furniture on carpet easier for smaller items the moving men coasters did seem to reduce friction and make it easier for me to push or pull items into place but for really heavy things on hardwood floors i didnt get much help from the moving men and the whole point is that theyre supposed to help you move heavy things
3866707 i gave it a c the idea is that it allows you to use your computer and plug a regular phone into your computer to use the internet so it feels like youre using a regular phone overall it works ok with decent call quality with some delay and a few drop outs and its pretty easy to get it up and running the average phone bill for u s residents is 40 a month using the magic jack you pay 40 for the product plus 6 95 for shipping and handling which includes a year of free local and long distance calling to u s and canadian numbers after that its 20 a year so its technically cheaper than a landline the cons if youre the kind of person like me who doesnt want to miss a call and want them to go to voice mail you would have to pay the electricity costs to keep your computer on and that could raise your bill the 911 function is a little confusing to set up if you dont set up 911 the dispatcher wont know your address if you call it just didnt seem to measure up to what they promise
3866708 i use the admin ssl plugin to secure my wordpress admin area but unfortunately changes in wp 2 5 broke it
3866709 the north south divide is not a transient problem that reflects a short lived hiatus as manufacturing declines and service sector economies take its place
3866710 nor does it reflect a failure of government policy to do what is needed
3866711 rather it is evidence that the north the powerhouse of the industrial revolution is now a less desirable location for business for reasons that are geographical and entirely outside its control or that of central and local government
3866712 it is time to stop pretending that there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3866713 the evidence strongly suggests that there is no chance of people in sunderland having the same opportunities as the people in birmingham or portsmouth let alone the same chances as those in london or oxford
3866714 in the last year alone sunderland attracted 1 000 new residents successful places such as sunderland provide a counterbalance to the overcrowded south east
3866715 more people are now working in the city of sunderland than ever before and this economic rebirth has catapulted the city up the national business league
3866716 this report has got nothing to do with the conservative party this is an independent think tank it has charitable status i think this report is complete rubbish
3866717 regeneration of our northern cities has been a key conservative theme over the past three years and one of the first things i did as leader was to set up the cities taskforce to look in to how we can further renew and regenerate our great cities
3866718 exactly the sort of vindictive anti northern thinking that led to the widespread industrial decline of swathes of the north under thatcher
3866719 cameron can distance himself from this all he wants but he needs to explain why his friends have no faith in the north
3866720 to state that northern cities like bradford liverpool and my home town of hull have no hope of being regenerated in the 21st century and that people should move to london oxford and cambridge is the most insulting and ignorant policy ive ever heard the conservatives still see people as economic units to be moved around not as people with families who want to live and work in the cities they were born in

3866754 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3866755 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3866756 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3866757 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade

3866830 ondernemingen leggen vooral verantwoording af voor hun financi le en economische resultaten veel minder voor hun sociaal beleid en amper voor bijvoorbeeld de ecologische effecten van hun bedrijfsvoering of hoe ze met mensenrechten omspringen
3866831 ik ben geen tegenstander van ondernemingen ik erken graag dat grote bedrijven een belangrijke rol spelen in de creatie van welvaart zonder ondernemingen hebben we geen verzekerde risicos en minder tewerkstelling maar de vraag is wanneer willen en zullen ze eens verantwoording afleggen niet alleen aan de aandeelhouders maar ook aan de maatschappij
3866832 omdat de beslissingen van grote bedrijven minstens zo ingrijpend zijn voor het leven van veel bewoners als de wetten en het optreden van overheden
3866833 we weten dat die bedrijven uitgegroeid zijn tot ontzettende machtsstructuren
3866834 er zijn al een paar bedrijven die dat doen maar ze vormen een kleine minderheid telecom italia is een voorbeeld op het vlak van transparantie dat bedrijf geeft het publiek echt in alles inzage zelfs als het gaat over de processen waarin ze verwikkeld zijn
3866835 ook belgische bedrijven zouden de moed moeten hebben om te zeggen wij nemen breed gedragen opiniemakers in onze raad van bestuur op mensen die niet gegroeid zijn in onze ondernemingen maar die het klankbord zijn van de maatschappij mensen die de werking van ons bedrijf aan alle sociale ecologische of culturele aspecten toetsen
3866836 er zijn nu geen echt onafhankelijke bestuurders vandaag worden die zogenaamde onafhankelijken gewoon gekozen om in de raad van bestuur te zetelen vervolgens gaat het bedrijf na of de nieuwelingen volgens een al dan niet brede interpretatie van de bestaande criteria mogelijk in aanmerking komen om onafhankelijk bestuurder genoemd te worden dat heeft natuurlijk niets met echte onafhankelijkheid te maken
3866837 er is maar n raad van bestuur op overheidsniveau die ik zelf
3866838 dat ging als volgt eerst was er een advertentie in jobat en vacature en hun franstalige tegenhangers bestuurders gezocht met een
3866839 ik ben niet a priori tegen door partijen benoemde bestuurders
3866840 maar globaal gezien tenderen ze om de staat in de enge zin van het woord te verdedigen of te vertegenwoordigen niet de samenleving als geheel ik geloof in een goed evenwicht vandaar dat er meer onafhankelijken moeten komen
3866841 dat klopt johnny thys ceo van de post wp contacteerde me toen met de suggestie dat ik toch maar beter de klassieke consultancybedrijven erbij zou betrekken ik weet niet waarom hij dat deed maar ik ben niet ingegaan op zijn voorstel ik vrees dat die bedrijven uit dezelfde vijver vissen en dat leidt nadien tot het klassieke copain copain spel i scratch your back so youll scratch mine ik wilde daar van af
3866842 dat is dan zo als je bedrijven tot transparantie wilt verplichten dan zal ook de stijl van de bestuurskamers en salons moeten veranderen dan zal ook de werking en de verloning van die beheerders transparanter moeten hun maatschappelijke impact is inderdaad erg groot maar ze worden daarvoor nooit ter verantwoording geroepen ik heb het over de lippensen en davignons van deze wereld die hebben de touwtjes in handen
3866843 die attitude was vroeger misschien algemeen maar die zou toch mogen veranderen ik heb dat interne proces bij kbc meegemaakt ik heb nu het gevoel dat dit bedrijf op het vlak van verantwoord ondernemen vandaag verder staat dan veel andere financi le bedrijven
3866844 toen ik op de raad van bestuur van de kredietbank voor het eerst mijn uitleg mocht doen over ethisch beleggen waren er een paar die aandachtig luisterden maar waren er ook die eens achteroverleunden met een glimlach van jaja die modegril zal straks wel overwaaien
3866845 toen ik staatssecretaris was heb ik met het vbo en voka vaak gediscussieerd over corporate social responsibility als zij initiatieven steunen is dat toch nog kleinschalig bedrijven zijn te weinig doordrongen van de noodzaak ervan als ik vragen stelde zeiden ze wij doen dat al via zelfregulering natuurlijk maar iedereen merkt dat die vrijwilligheid niet werkt vrijwilligheid leidt meestal tot vrijblijvendheid in duitsland en nederland is men daarom verder gegaan en hebben de bedrijven striktere regels aanvaard
3866846 en hier doen sommigen alsof ik de revolutie predik het acw onderschrijft die voorstellen wel maar als het vbo een kik geeft staan de meeste open vlders met de pink op de naad van de broek maar de trend is gezet en zal nooit meer omgekeerd worden

3867127 clint took the race out and led up the first climb a 500 foot ascent with more than 20 vertical gain which the open men had to run three times hes one of the smartest runners i know and i knew hed be the one to watch i passed him after the first descent about 1 2 mile into the race and kept the lead
3867128 at medical school i dont have much time so i go out and run one hour as hard as i can there are hills around my apartment but nothing like the mountains in colorado i really liked the hill on this course i just figured i would go one pace no matter what and today that pace was faster than everyone else
3867129 i felt ok and just tried to keep it going i tried to get any lead i could going up and i felt if i could hold off bernie boettcher the first lap there were three laps of 4 4 km each i could do it again hes a great downhill runner so it wasnt a given
3867130 and i really cruised the downs i loved the course it was a real trail challenge it was probably the hardest trail race ive ever done the world masters keswick england 2005 might have been a bit tougher the descents were steeper
3867131 crazy it was great the hill was pretty severe even in europe ive never run anything that steep for that long i was thinking on my run i need to be the bernie boettcher of the downhill then if i could just be 1 2 of that it would be great i was ahead on the uphill he boettcher came blowing by me on the first downhill

3867169 what its telling us is you should go ahead and sample the plant im eating to search for pharmaceutical compounds
3867170 this is the first time that anyone has proven that brightly coloured insects associate with active plants more than they do with inactive plants
3867171 one could go into the field and scan wild insect populations
3867172 this would still be labour intensive but would hopefully increase your hit rate in comparison to randomly collecting plants
3867173 intact ecosystems are what allow this type of facilitated search to take place

3867188 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3867189 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3867205 initially i probably lost about 10 pounds because i wasnt working out
3867206 all of that was muscle ive put about two pounds back on but im still pretty light
3867207 as a two time defending pga champion it was a lot more frustrating not to be competing and that hurts the most
3867208 the thing i miss the most about not competing is the fight ive gone through this experience before so i knew what i was in for i know im in no condition to beat anybody right now so i dont have a problem with not being able to compete
3867209 i want to congratulate p draig harrington on his wins at the british open and pga
3867210 i dont wanna change my life or change who i am
3867211 we are confirming one thing that kirkuk is for all kirkukis from all ethnicities
3867212 they should manage kirkuk together equally so no one could be marginalized
3867213 we want kirkuk to be an iraqi city not a kurdish city or an arab city or a turkmen city
3867214 they can do whatever they want to do but they cannot keep it
3867215 if thats not acceptable then the central government should send its forces to kirkuk to protect us
3867216 or the kurds should increase the number of turkmen serving in kirkuks security forces or someone should bring in international troops because we no longer trust the kurds or the americans who back them
3867217 i mean turkmen buy from me kurds buy from me christians everybody buys from me
3867218 ive never seen anyone an arab or a turkmen say no you are a kurd i will not buy from you so that means we are living together as brothers

3867222 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3867223 home packages help older australians continue to live in their own homes and remain independent and active
3867224 there has been strong growth in community aged care service delivery in recent years which is planned and is expected to continue to grow for several more years with australias ageing population
3867225 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias taxpayers and this years budget process but the states leaders have failed to act
3867226 therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3867227 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3867228 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
3867229 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune juice and be in bed by 9 oclock

3867231 is that a joystick in the gallery or are you just overly excited
3867232 its not surprising that tom suozzi is trying to defend david patersons tax gimmick after all it was suozzis idea but suozzi is dead wrong to say the governor has been personally attacked david paterson has been around long enough to know whats personal and whats about policy
3867233 heres whats personal the impact on 3 million kids around the state if the governor and the legislature enact a property tax cap that devastates public education it will be personal for the families whose children go to school in overcrowded classrooms it will be personal for the teachers who are fired it will be personal for the homeowners whose property values will go down with the quality of their local schools
3867234 this property tax gimmick is the wrong answer it will hurt our kids and our communities
3867235 funding for schools that used to come from a progressive income tax now comes from regressive property taxes only texas relies on local taxes more than new york

3867241 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it

3867251 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3867252 these patients had been through experimental treatments so it is not like we got anybody who had standard of care left weichselbaum said
3867253 although our radiation wasnt able to control the disease in everybody if we had treated where they had recurred with further radiation surgery or other types of ablation they could have been rendered disease free
3867254 most likely this will be used with the targeted therapies

3867263 i dont know that the military even looked for him
3867264 i guess they figured he was gone and thats about it
3867265 i have been encouraged by the direction weve been going in

3867289 the government of india finds deeply objectionable the series of remarks by the official spokesman and leaders in pakistan on recent events in the indian state of jammu and kashmir
3867290 we are witnessing a recurrence of pakistani rhetoric and allegations that are factually wrong and that bear no relationship to reality
3867291 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
3867292 it is not too late for pakistani leaders and spokesmen to desist from the course of action that they have recently embarked upon and we would urge them to do so forthwith
3867293 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in the indian occupied kashmir which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people and violation of their human rights
3867294 gross violation of human rights of kashmiri people unwarranted violence against them and their economic blockade perpetrated by extremist elements

3867307 unlike in mclaurin black children in public schools were not being segregated from whites within the same school and thereby treated differently from their peers

3867350 deploying femtocells requires a good understanding of market segmentation of both mobile consumer and household markets meticulous planning and targeted marketing campaigns which mean operators will have to invest substantial amount of money if they want femtocell services to gain popularity
3867351 if femtocells are sold to customers in sporadic fashion via traditional mobile operators channels then this may induce a huge scattering of femtocell deployment over large areas not only will this make it hard to manage faps femtocell access points and related networks but most importantly this would mean the operator will not be able to make any capex capital expenditure or opex operational expenditure savings
3867352 the presidency thinks right now its better to focus on problem solving rather than trying to go into characterisation of the war who started what who reacted and the eu is united behind the idea
3867353 the presidency wants to preserve as much room for manoeuvre for future mediation as possible
3867354 the situation is still evolving its not black and white of course georgia made some mistakes russia made some mistakes but the idea now is to help mediation to see what we can do from a humanitarian point of view
3867355 the eu should say no to russias subjugation of georgia and push russia out this means tough language sanctions against russia and quick eu humanitarian intervention
3867356 the first lesson of this crisis is that the old policy of eu non engagement has encouraged both parties to escalate their actions from an eu perspective the first casualty is the theory that by getting more involved in georgia the eu will irritate russia and provoke instability
3867357 if and when it changes we will have a wholesale business and our association with tata will give us great experience in india
3867358 we view this as a sensible deal for tesco with a strong partner in tata which has existing retail capability and strong local knowledge of the indian market whilst it will enable tesco to begin the development infrastructure and supply chain which is one of the current constraints of the indian market to modern retail practices
3867359 people will judge us not by what we say but what we do

3867383 spire semiconductors revenue increased by 77 compared to last years second quarter this resulted in improved gross margins compared with last year due to improved facilities utilization we continue to work on several contracts to customize gallium arsenide solar cells for concentrator system developers
3867384 spire biomedical processing services continue to show good performance and our contract research and development activity increased substantially due to the start of newly awarded contracts we have no additional update on our catheter product line other than we are continuing to evaluate strategic alternatives
3867385 we do not intend to pursue additional interests at this time
3867386 al gore says everyone will benefit when new government rules require companies to pay to reduce global warming but some people will benefit more than others as will some companies benefiting most are those like the ex vice president who can set up and invest in companies that will profit from the federal regulations imposing heavy costs on others
3867387 we continue to see strong opportunities in the global military market for our portfolio of products and services as evidenced by these contracts valued at up to c 106 million in addition to our rotorsim announcement last week which is worth more than c 40 million to cae
3867388 it is encouraging to see defence forces looking more and more to modelling simulation and support services to address challenges such as maintaining readiness high operational demand on aircraft and increasing fuel costs with our global footprint and expanding capabilities to serve the entire defence systems lifecycle cae is well placed for success in our military business
3867389 the afiile program helps further establish caes leadership position in military training services in canada

3867398 perhaps in todays arts funding environment every museum must work a potboiler or two into its exhibition calendar but chihuly has come to personify everything meretricious in contemporary art the most exciting thing about his work its status as art stands in question

3867407 my personal view is that this isnt a random attack
3867408 there is a reason for these two people to come to this address there is a motive behind it and over the next few days we will find out firstly the motive and the identity
3867409 we just asked the neighbours people in the general area to search their sections and if they find any weapons handguns or hammers to notify police straight away
3867410 we will be talking to parents friends and family to get a clearer picture of what this 14 year old boy was really like
3867411 a good 14 year old boy from a good family
3867412 they would have told someone what has happened and we really need those people to come forward
3867413 they the attackers didnt know the boy they didnt know my son they just came off the street
3867414 in conclusion this study demonstrates that patients with early stage breast cancer who are disease free at five years after adjuvant systemic therapy have a substantially increased residual risk of recurrence
3867415 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3867416 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3867417 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless
3867418 unlawful for any child under the age of 18 to loiter on the streets

3867431 directives on the use of the name of god in the sacred liturgy
3867432 some impact on the use of particular pieces of liturgical music in our country as well as in the composition of variable texts such as the general intercessions for the celebration of the mass and the other sacraments
3867433 apart from a motive of a purely philological order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
3867434 the name of almighty god expressed by the hebrew tetragrammaton and rendered in latin by the word dominus is to be rendered into any given vernacular by a word equivalent in meaning
3867435 notwithstanding such a clear norm in recent years the practice has crept in of pronouncing the god of israels proper name
3867436 the practice of vocalizing it is met with both in the reading of biblical texts taken from the lectionary as well as in prayers and hymns and it occurs in diverse written and spoken forms
3867437 california has sent a clear message today our state stands in solidarity with the winnemem wintu tribe to correct a terrible injustice by the federal government
3867438 its not time for the federal government to acknowledge its mistake and once again recognize the tribe
3867439 this resolution is long overdue for years we have struggled to maintain our traditions on our own
3867440 recognition would enable us to maintain our spiritual lifeways get our youth scholarships and healthcare to have the state of california declare their support for us sends a message that we are no longer alone on this issue
3867441 we will be taking this resolution to washington d c we hope it will be impetus for our congressional representatives to help us
3867442 recognition impacts our very survival as a people california is in danger of losing a part of its cultural heritage if we do not act on this now
3867443 the governor presents this bond as a forward thinking comprehensive solution but in reality its the same old thing another version of past proposals to build more dams put in a peripheral canal and bail out corporate agribusiness
3867444 california has to put its own house in order before asking us to support another bond
3867445 instead of committing to a cost effective statewide water conservation plan modeled on the advances pioneered in southern california this plan wastes billions of dollars on outdated technologies
3867446 this years closure of the pacific salmon fishing season clearly demonstrates the impact of water mismanagement its killing jobs and eliminating our fishing industry after tens of millions of dollars spent our fisheries are worse off than ever
3867447 nowhere is the california water crisis more evident than in the delta we cant continue basing californias water security on risky exports from the bay delta estuary
3867448 communities are struggling as budget cuts dry up state support for our health education and infrastructure programs we cant afford to repay another 9 2 billion dollar water bond
3867449 ironically this bond is called the safe drinking water act but it does nothing to address the drinking water crisis in thousands of california communities
3867450 we need funding for programs that help provide safe clean drinking water despite its huge price tag this bond doesnt deliver
3867451 fortunately we still have funding available from a prior water bond to address urgent needs across the state rather than rush into another billion dollar bond this year were supporting passage of sb 1xx perata machado and steinberg which would release 800 million dollars in unspent funds from proposition 84 passed in 2006
3867452 he came in and went into this office and started shooting

3867455 there is a register fully inscribed to which bear witness those nearest to allah truly the righteous will be in bliss on thrones of dignity will they command a sight of all things thou wilt recognise in their faces the beaming brightness of bliss their thirst will be slaked with pure wine sealed the seal thereof will be musk and for this let those aspire who have aspirations with it will be given a mixture of tasneem
3867456 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co republicans enjoy nice nice even a little foot in mouth by huckabee no matter clinton flash
3867457 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co california hypocritically talks new oil tax to stop legislators salary cuts
3867458 but what is most disturbing is that an islamic country would dare subpoena citizens of another state for an action not committed within its borders but in a land where no laws were broken besides being meant as a weapon of intimidation this tactic also represents a frightening extension of islamic law into the heart of western countries but perhaps most ominously this incredibly brazen measure shows that even a small islamic country like jordan has no fear of europe and indeed no retaliatory response met the jordanian courts action against european citizen s
3867459 es poco probable que los ajustes recientes en las expectativas de inflaci n de corto plazo jueguen un papel crucial en la decisi n de pol tica del pr ximo viernes este no ser a el caso de la evoluci n favorable de las negociaciones salariales

3867467 their loose trio is very dangerous theyre all ball runners
3867468 if they get momentum they create space for other players out wide to finish off they are lethal
3867469 there is no question about the motivation in this side
3867470 it just comes about because of the pressure not only on the coaching staff but also on the players
3867471 the pressure is enormous and that just gets the players motivated we havent thought about revenge at all

3867493 algunos creen que una de las formas de solucionar esa crisis alimentaria es producir m s alimentos gen ticamente modificados en los que el adn de un cultivo se modifica de manera artificial para que esos cultivos desarrollen propiedades espec ficas
3867494 de lo que debemos hablar es de seguridad alimentaria y no de la producci n de los alimentos
3867495 si creen que este es el camino a tomar vamos a terminar con millones de peque os agricultores de todo el mundo que son expulsados de sus tierras hacia conurbanos insostenibles imposibles de gestionar degradados y disfuncionales

3867526 catalysts vision is to leverage its 29 billion balance sheet credit backing and innovative technology solutions to become the first multi state multi commodity multi family energy service provider in the country as energy prices increase efficient management of utility services during the move in and move out process is core to providing exceptional service to the multi family industry utility theft and administrative burden is costing the multi family industry millions of dollars in unnecessary expenses ultimately affecting noi our focus is to listen to our customers and provide solutions to their utility needs
3867527 by combining catalystconnect tm with csasecure r our customers will aggressively reduce their exposure to energy theft lower costs associated with managing utility related accounting activities and the administrative burden of collecting from their residents all while consolidating their electric and natural gas supply across state lines this allows our customers to focus their resources on maximizing their bottom line
3867528 csasecure r serves a real need in the multi family market as proven by the overwhelmingly positive responses from our customers this product allows community managers to identify utility theft within days of move in and quickly trigger disconnect orders to prevent further loss this helps keep utility costs down for the community which in the long run benefits the residents too
3867529 given catalysts aggressive national expansion plan into deregulated natural gas and electricity markets we see this as a great opportunity to bring our flagship product to customers nationwide
3867530 our project calls for a very specific blend of power and flexibility that we felt would only be provided by gamebryo we were also encouraged by emergents interest in building a long term relationship and giving us intimate support at every stage of development
3867531 our worldwide support infrastructure gives us an unprecedented and unmatched ability to empower developers and publishers in a period of increasing globalization
3867532 emergent isnt just a technology provider we build long lasting relationships with the development community by being a resource they can count on
3867533 we were one of only 10 reading program providers named to the original list back in 2006 when the initiative was launched
3867534 the grant was reauthorized in the latest legislature session and we are very proud to be once again included in the select listing that tea has created for texas schools
3867535 we were able to demonstrate that although this was not a technology grant our fast forword software more than met all the iri requirements
3867536 for the past eight years the fast forword family of products has been helping texas students succeed in school districts such as dallas marshall desoto arlington killeen united laredo and amarillo
3867537 hundreds of school districts nationwide have performed independent evaluations and reported improved performance that includes the dallas independent school district which conducted a four year longitudinal study that showed participants closing the achievement gap by an average of 23 percent after just five and a half months now were eager to spur the achievements of another cohort of texas students
3867538 we are delighted that dan has agreed to serve as ceo

3867545 this endorsement by jcpenney is particularly pleasing to our efforts
3867546 the commitment by jcpenney to adopting renewable energy is indicative of a major and emerging trend in u s retailers to utilize their own facilities and resources to help solve the electric generation and transmission issues we face in north america penneys endorsement of aerocam technology represents a great move forward in the adoption of wind turbines in the emerging commercial wind space
3867547 this wind power project furthers our commitment to incorporate sustainability into all aspects of our operations we will closely monitor the results to determine how we can best leverage this technology to make use of renewable energy while also benefiting our business
3867548 it all adds up to a solution that delivers more power and more choice of location
3867549 with a lower total cost of development and operation and a faster payback period the aerocam has the potential to equip almost every local community business and government building with its own renewable energy power source and improve the economic efficiency of conventional wind farms
3867550 in essence our efficient active aerodynamic design lends itself to smaller wind turbines which can operate closer to the ground or on a rooftop
3867551 they can handle a wide range of wind velocities anywhere between 4 and 80 mph
3867552 today there are very few turbines in the 100 to 500 kilowatt class this is due to the high cost of ownership sheer physical size and maintainability of existing commercial designs now evolving into a super wind turbine class of 6 megawatt machines with blades exceeding 50 meters in diameter
3867553 this all works well assuming unlimited transmission line capacity unfortunately transmission bottlenecks are becoming one of the single biggest issues for conventional wind farms which tend to be located in remote areas where the electricity grid infrastructure was never designed to transmit the amount of energy that can now be generated and which is now required
3867554 with this recognition josh contributes to this newspapers 40 year tradition of excellence in journalism receiving this award from the national newspaper association is both a professional honor and validation that the washington blade is the most trusted source of information for the lbgt community
3867555 hosting these solar and wind projects will add to our knowledge of the benefits and potential applications of renewable energy programs at our facilities
3867556 together with the energy saving initiatives we already have in place in our stores and distribution centers this is another significant step toward achieving our environmental objectives with enthusiastic support from jcpenney associates nationwide we are constantly looking for opportunities to contribute to a cleaner environment and run our business more cost effectively
3867557 these projects further our commitment to incorporate sustainability into all aspects of our operations we will closely monitor the results to determine how we can best leverage these innovative methods to increase our participation in renewable energy projects while also benefiting our business
3867558 we are proud of what we are accomplishing as an organization to reduce energy consumption and extend jcpenneys legacy of social responsibility and our associates remain focused on seeking new ways to protect the environment

3867575 we have decided to take a break from doing forward russia for a lot of different reasons the idea of doing another tour with nothing new to offer was something that enthused none of us and the idea of re booting on a productive strand is something were not quite ready to face just yet added to which the last few months of inactivity has led us all on paths away from the band
3867576 i know that sounds odd having released an album only a few months ago but i dont think any of us were connected to the mechanics of its release i dont know how it happened but i want to thank all our management the guys and gals at cooking vinyl and all the other people who worked on the record for putting all their efforts into the release of life processes and apologise for our complete failure to engage in the release of it

3867593 if the country has not been able to enforce this law in 15 years how can we expect compliance in toxic waste confinement facilities where it is harder to monitor these things
3867594 there are three main reasons for this situation the first is political as federal authorities have been extremely tolerant with state and municipal governments when they fail to enforce the norm
3867595 as a result it is too complex and costly to insist on compliance 15 years later
3867596 secondly corruption has been persistent amongst politically connected individuals who collect solid waste for sale on the informal market
3867597 the third reason is that legislative authorities have opted to ignore the subject
3867598 nobody issues any fines and federal state and municipal governments do not demand any efforts from each other
3867599 reported that a spanish courier service seur had the spanish team pose for a photo while putting their fingers at the edge of their eyes
3867600 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3867601 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture without a doubt some press didnt see it that way calderon also wrote that the pose was the idea of the photographer and they were just being cooperative

3867638 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3867639 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3867640 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3867641 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3867642 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3867643 the kids can still sit there they can just lay a large textbook on the spikes i hope they do also at night the gay guys can urinate in the space between the spike strips and the urine can pool there
3867644 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3867645 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3867646 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3867647 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3867648 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3867649 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3867650 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3867651 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3867652 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3867653 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3867654 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3867655 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3867656 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3867657 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3867658 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3867659 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3867660 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3867661 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3867662 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3867663 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3867664 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3867665 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3867666 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3867667 if there is such a thing as miracles this would be one
3867668 i ask myself every day is the tough training worth it

3867675 they will most likely be small fuel efficient and inexpensive
3867676 we are eager to begin exporting small cars from china as soon as possible that will attract new customers in two segments in which our brands are underrepresented very young buyers and entry level buyers
3867677 its generally understood that the only way to compete in the ultra price sensitive subcompact market requires the most low cost manufacturing base
3867678 we have to make sure were going about this the right way that people are using the technology appropriately and with full consent
3867679 in addition all the fire eagle developers must sign a code of conduct agreement and also divulge in detail to users of their applications how customer data is being used
3867680 we also have the ability to shut down applications that we feel are misusing the service and yahoo customers can voice any concerns directly to the fire eagle team

3867682 details of the parallel russian cyberwarfare campaign against georgia began to emerge even as russian tanks appeared on the south side of the roki tunnel in south ossetia on aug 8 there is little doubt at this point that a concerted assault took place alongside conventional military operations

3867689 hay personas que llevan 10 a os viviendo en la habana pero no tienen permiso para trabajar porque todav a no est n legales
3867690 estuvimos varios a os alquilados siempre cambiando de casa sin tener nada hasta que descubr que mi esposo ten a una relaci n con otra mujer as que dije esto no es para m me separ definitivamente y regres otra vez a oriente de eso hace cuatro a os

3867696 conozco un pueblecito que se llama guatemala donde el nivel de vida no es bueno
3867697 en mayar tambi n hay mucha gente adicta al alcohol
3867698 recuerdo que en una reuni n con los padres un maestro integral les dijo que ellos ten an que comprender que sus hijos ya eran hombres y mujeres y por eso se comportaban de esa manera
3867699 yo conozco el caso de una muchacha de mi pueblo que vino para la habana y se puso a jinetear

3867702 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

3867713 i really thought someone would have shot me before i got to this point
3867714 in the shopping mall of the mind hes in the toy department
3867715 i have always to start my own company i just didnt have the faith in myself that i could do it i searched for fulfillment in other companies but finally i surrendered to god and i have to tell you that now i am finally content

3867720 the damage is significant especially in the city centre and many houses hit were obviously not military targets houses shops and the hospital but i would not describe it as a city razed to the ground
3867721 we have serious doubts about the numbers provided by the russian authorities so far the number of wounded and killed just do not support each other because the number of wounded is usually far larger than those killed
3867722 at this point where the conflict is winding down it is extremely irresponsible of the authorities to give these figures without evidence to support it
3867723 i had a feeling id got there but until i saw my name come up there was a lot of relief then
3867724 ive been trying to force myself to eat and drink but it just keeps coming out faster than its going in
3867725 i was always a bit worried today that i was going to hit the wall at some stage of the race probably with about 400m to go suddenly the great wall of china jumped out in front of me
3867726 there are a few subtle things that spring to mind right now but well mull it over with chris nillson our coach and hit it hard on saturday
3867727 im confident that when we get it right weve got good boat speed weve been able to do it in europe so well be looking to reproduce that
3867728 our state of mind now if anything is only going to make us faster on saturday
3867729 were still in a good position the experiences weve had over the last four years mean we can take anything thrown at us and not panic not let it get to our heads
3867730 people have got nothing to lose and pull out some pretty amazing results
3867731 who would have thought the greek guy was going to be close to me today
3867732 i admire addicts in a world where everybody is waiting for some blind random disaster or some sudden disease the addict has the comfort of knowing what will most likely wait for him down the road hes taken some control over his ultimate fate and his addiction keeps the cause of death from being a total surprise
3867733 how much longer am i going to think about my hair more often than about things in the world that really matter
3867734 as if they were beloved elderly auties the kind who did embarrassing things at the beach like roll their stockings into tubes around their ankles but whom i was proud of because they were so great in every real and important way
3867735 she wears her faith well as opposed to wielding it like a club
3867736 its so different having a living father who loves you even someone complex and imperfect after your father dies defeat becomes pretty defeating when hes still alive there are setbacks and heartbreak but youre still the apple of someones eye
3867737 piss on the world because when the world gets its chance itll piss on you
3867738 you need to get on the parents not the kids
3867739 thats the problem here where are the parents in our branch the parents dont come to the library with their children they drop them off and leave them unattended all day
3867740 gee i could do this for the rest of my life and be happy
3867741 well i know i remember identifying with becky sharp from vanity fair though i cant remember why
3867742 so we are thinking about moving to france in two to five years for hitchcocks grad school so you guys definitely need to start saving money to visit if sex and the city taught me anything its that if you move to france you miss your friends
3867743 in my homeopathy practice i look for complete symptoms which reveal the patients illness
3867744 a big budget should mean the film will look a lot better than some of the old movies
3867745 i wont use real silver you know like the big old heavy a forks and knives i cant do that its the same thing as the antique furniture i just dont like old stuff im creeped out by it and i have no explanation why
3867746 um i guess this is a salad best enjoyed at the house of that one scary lady down the street who never leaves the house and talks to her knicknacks
3867747 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
3867748 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3867749 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3867750 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3867751 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3867752 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3867753 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3867754 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3867755 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3867756 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3867757 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3867758 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3867759 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3867760 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3867761 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3867762 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3867763 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3867764 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3867765 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3867766 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3867767 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3867768 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3867769 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3867770 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3867771 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3867772 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3867773 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3867774 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3867775 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3867776 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3867777 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3867778 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3867779 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3867780 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3867781 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3867782 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3867783 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3867784 in order to defeat your evil villain you only need remember this every problem can be solved with sufficient explosives
3867785 i am so grateful for our dream relationship and for the way your have put your touches onto our home
3867786 if you want to make your dream come true you have to concretely imagine it imagine your vision clearly if you wish to be rich ten years later think about what you need to achieve in the next nine years think about what you want to achieve in the next year what are going to do next month then get more granular by asking yourself what your plan is today if you can answer these questions and proceed step by step you will be rich but because almost people dream nebulously their dreams never come true

3867801 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3867802 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3867803 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3867804 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3867805 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3867806 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3867807 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3867808 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3867809 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3867810 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3867811 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3867812 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3867813 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3867814 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3867815 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3867816 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3867817 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3867818 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3867819 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3867820 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3867821 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3867822 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3867823 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3867824 in europe on september 15 and the u s canada on october 14 via
3867825 follows in this pattern it is a comment on the celebrity driven times in which we live where the myriad of reality based tv shows are producing a generation of c lebrities
3867826 we went back in and roughed up the studio version a bit i think it gives a fair idea of the kind of energy on the album
3867827 i see the song as rogers take on the increasing emphasis on fame for its own sake
3867828 see i still let you come to my feast even with the unrully kids
3867829 god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
3867830 greater love has no one than this that one lay down his life for his friends
3867831 we can help them with additional expenses for travel but soldiers have to submit a receipt and it has to be looked at by our finance people

3867833 a buon punto ha osservato marino abbiamo centrato il primo obiettivo della stagione cio lingresso in uefa ora tenteremo di andare il pi avanti possibile la gara con gli albanesi del vllaznia non affatto semplice ha sottolineato il dg azzurro allemittente campana come tutte le partite in uefa daltronde pensate che la nosta gara col panionios pi che un turno di intertoto per la caratura dellavversario poteva essere considerato un buon ottavo di finale ludinese in tourn e in grecia ha giocato sul campo del paok salonicco che giunto sei posti in classifica dietro il panionios ed stata sconfitta ad ogni modo abbiamo gi salito un altro gradino importante per il futuro gioved proveremo a salirne un altro ancora in campo la squadra albanese cercher di qualificarsi con i mezzi che ha a disposizione il vllaznia colmer con lagonismo il gap tecnico incontestabile che ha nei confronti del napoli
3867834 si vero ha ammesso ci sono stato ed i giornali hanno carpito il nostro lavoro jodlowiec lo seguiamo ormai da un anno e un giocatore che speriamo di riuscire a tesserare la trattativa stata anticipata dai giornali ma non ancora a livello di firma il mercato dellest lo conosciamo bene e lo seguiamo attentamente qualche giocatore ci gi sfuggito allultimo momento per la concorrenza spietata di club inglesi francesi spagnoli e tedeschi tuttavia non ci sfuggono per questioni economiche
3867835 noi abbiamo una opzione per jodlowiec e lassenso del procuratore del giocatore il suo arrivo a napoli indipendente dalla partenza di domizzi al ragazzo polacco dobbiamo concedere qualche mese per ambientarsi ha precisato marino arriva senza conoscere la lingua e il campionato italiano da lui non pretendiamo tutto e subito pu arrivare anche se non parte domizzi
3867836 non me lo spiego ha ammesso probabilmente abbiamo sbagliato qualcosa nella comunciazione perch molti pensano che il napoli allultimo minuto se ne debba liberare
3867837 e chiaro che quando necessario forzare un p perch c un obiettivo stagionale appena quindici giorni dopo linizio del ritiro pu succedere che qualche giocatore sia vittima di infortuni ad ogni modo devo fare i complimenti a reja e ai nostri preparatori atletici che ci hanno consentito di vincere le due gare di intertoto dispiace per mannini per lui si poteva fare qualcosa in pi perch ha subito due volte lo stesso infortunio in questo caso abbiamo sbagliato sia noi che il giocatore
3867838 sono contentissimo di lui ha sottolineato il dg trovo piuttosto superficiale e dilettantistico il voler contare quanti gol fa in amichevole o notare gli assist piuttosto che i gol gli assist di denis per bogliacino e hamsik nelle due partite con il panionios valgono quanto un gol ad ogni modo non possiamo valutarlo dalle reti in precampionato il giocatore ha confermato da vicino quello che avevamo visto da lontano e quindi siamo soddisfatti
3867839 dopo linfortunio di rocchi sarebbe giusto da parte di casiraghi chiamarlo altrimenti non ho capito perch hanno portato in cina una riserva quando poteva allenarsi qui con il napoli
3867840 ho parlato con angelo peruzzi inviato da lippi a frosinone e mi ha assicurato che gli osservati speciali del napoli sono maggio blasi e santacroce ritengo che gi sabato prossimo uno di questi sar convocato in prospettiva sono sotto osservazione tre giocatori del napoli e la cosa mi inorgoglisce se pensiamo che due anni fa eravamo a lanciano
3867841 ezequiel ci sta facendo sognare due anni fa sognavamo luefa e giocatori del calibro di messi oggi siamo in uefa e abbiamo un partner di messi nella nazionale olimpica argentina lavezzi ha solo 23 anni e il meglio di s lo dar tra i 25 e i 28 anni e un ragazzo straordinario che non dimentica di essere grato a napoli in questo ultimo anno sia sotto il profilo umano per laffetto della gente che professionale quando penso che avevano detto che era un piantagrane e uno poco professionale oggi sorrido e guardo avanti con grande soddisfazione lo sento ogni giorno ha concluso marino lavezzi non dimentica mai napoli e i napoletani credo che questo faccia piacere ai tifosi

3867850 if there was a dark spot in the announcement it revolved around gross margins although average sales prices were higher than most analysts expected the cost of polysilicon or poly continues to be high gross margins came in at 25 4 which compares unfavorably to 27 7 last quarter and 35 2 a year ago management stated that they expect margins to continue to show weakness in the third quarter before rebounding in the fourth quarter and into 2009
3867851 any delay in ldks plans to produce raw materials would likely be a disappointment to investors but the positive side of this argument is that if production goes according to plan the likelihood for further appreciation in the stock price is very good
3867852 we are announcing that 21 positions are being eliminated in the austin office of ncsoft in the area of product development
3867853 primarily this is related to products which we have not previously announced and were in prototype phases we are also cutting some positions on the dungeon runners team after deciding not to port the client to other platforms at this time
3867854 the best way to avoid these situations is simple elect people who are honest and ethical and do not re elect anyone who even appears to lack these necessary qualities will new orleans ever learn
3867855 how are we new orleans citizens who are still proud to call new orleans home going to fix this to ensure that it can not happen again
3867856 this literally is the first of its type in texas
3867857 are you sure youre ready for this i mean you do know everything will break loose right
3867858 these are for when the s t rolls in you can wade through it in these
3867859 i didnt want to go in the life raft he made me go he had my gun
3867860 that i would get shot he had just shot four people

3867862 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3867863 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3867864 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3867865 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3867866 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3867867 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3867868 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3867869 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3867870 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3867871 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3867872 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3867873 while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3867874 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3867875 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3867876 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well

3867881 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3867882 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3867883 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3867884 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3867885 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3867886 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3867887 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3867888 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3867889 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3867890 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3867891 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3867892 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3867893 eu em novembro do ano passado fui informado de que existia uma opera o encomendada na pf contra mim eu n o dei muita credibilidade import ncia s o muitas informa es que chegam todo dia o que diziam que isso tinha sido pedido pelo diretor da abin doutor paulo lacerda e que isso ocorria como retalia o do doutor lacerda ao atribuir responsabilidade de eu ter entregue a uma revista de grande circula o relat rio que constavam contas dele no exterior

3867896 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3867897 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3867898 its easy to recruit because a lot of developers here are creating software for mobile devices on java for example it should be a win win situation for them since device support for windows mobile is increasing

3867901 the best part of playing in was meeting people from not only the u s but from other countries
3867902 i had a great time i started all eight of our games at forward
3867903 we had seven players so we all played a lot
3867904 our only losses were to another u s team called the hoopsters that won the gold medal and to a team from spain that won the silver medal
3867905 my husband mike and mother donna wyngarden were also at the friendship games
3867906 it was especially fun to have had this taken place during this olympic year
3867907 so much of how the competition was run reminds me of the olympics the opening ceremony had all the countries with their flags and a torch lighting ceremony with music blaring and lights flashing
3867908 i met a lot of neat people and made a lot of new friends
3867909 it didnt feel strange being the only player from michigan on the team
3867910 no one expects the democratic party not to support roe v wade but here weve gone from dogmatic positions to practical solutions
3867911 the language in the platform is a real step forward
3867912 for those women who want to take the child to term it strongly supports that choice and provides necessary support
3867913 its not surprising that tom suozzi is trying to defend david patersons tax gimmick after all it was suozzis idea but suozzi is dead wrong to say the governor has been personally attacked david paterson has been around long enough to know whats personal and whats about policy
3867914 heres whats personal the impact on 3 million kids around the state if the governor and the legislature enact a property tax cap that devastates public education it will be personal for the families whose children go to school in overcrowded classrooms it will be personal for the teachers who are fired it will be personal for the homeowners whose property values will go down with the quality of their local schools

3867918 house speaker nancy pelosi and other washington politicians lobby groups pledge support to rossport campaigner

3867923 the challenge of the 21st century is to meet the growing need for energy in ways that are not only profitable but sustainable

3867926 im really hoping the update helps a lot of existing owners that are frustrated with the difficulty to enjoy the game
3867927 ive spent a lot of time on tuning the difficulty particularly on recruit and soldier and brought more folks through to play it so this should be closer to the mark in being accessible from very casual to hardcore gamers and believe me im still including a challenging mode for those that want it

3867930 ap 213 have included a section on exegetical argument of romans 1 which i appreciated
3867931 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
3867932 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
3867933 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
3867934 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
3867935 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
3867936 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
3867937 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
3867938 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in
3867939 one could argue is it worth as much as they paid for it initially based on todays market
3867940 so the bottom line is theyre holding on for the long term and well see what happens
3867941 i dont know what happens in three years or what he says in five years or whatever but those discussions we dont get involved in
3867942 here the proposed draft was provided we politely reviewed it said thanks but no thanks and ultimately decided to go another way
3867943 this is a good old boy system that is killing the rights of consumers
3867944 to say we have been in collusion with someone over this brief is not correct and unfair
3867945 we are not taking a side the governor hopes that the people deserving of medical monitoring receive the medical monitoring that they need
3867946 governor manchin just showed us hes more concerned with big business in west virginia than with the health and well being of our families and children
3867947 maybe governor manchin should come here and try to explain his actions
3867948 just the simplest things bother me allergies a runny nose on a daily basis it worries and bothers me
3867949 might feel different maybe if his own family members were involved
3867950 the governor made his own judgment based on the issues
3867951 and his office wrote and filed their own brief with the west virginia supreme court
3867952 this is a high profile high dollar case so i can imagine that feelings and tempers may be fairly high
3867953 but from our point of view it is not unusual for this governor or other governors to participate in matters that are before the courts that have a direct impact on west virginia it is certainly not indicative of corruption

3867963 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
3867964 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi

3868056 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3868057 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

3868063 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3868064 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3868065 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3868066 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

3868068 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3868069 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3868070 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing

3868072 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

3868077 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3868078 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

3868086 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

3868109 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3868110 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3868111 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together

3868113 the talks are adjourned not ended but i wouldnt say until when tsvangirai needs more time to consult
3868114 i wouldnt know about it we are facilitating discussions among three parties

3868116 it is interesting that we do not associate our sexuality with being free
3868117 too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states

3868120 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3868121 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3868122 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3868123 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3868124 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem

3868127 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3868128 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3868129 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3868130 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3868131 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3868132 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3868133 so while ea may not have lived up to its marketing directive its succeeded in creating quite possibly the best most fully featured sports sim available on the wii

3868135 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3868136 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3868137 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3868138 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3868139 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3868140 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3868141 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3868142 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3868143 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3868144 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3868145 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3868146 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3868147 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3868148 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3868149 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3868150 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3868151 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie

3868153 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was
3868154 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3868155 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3868156 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3868157 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3868158 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3868159 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty

3868163 i do not see any obtainable objectives in lebanon and the longer we stay there the harder it will be to leave
3868164 he controlled what they ate what they did he controlled pretty much everything
3868165 i asked did you go to help and they looked at me like it was the strangest question dad pretty much did whatever he wanted to do
3868166 the victims of this type of abuse theyre made to believe theyre not worthy of anything that this is what they deserve
3868167 its amazing they were not allowed outside they were simply not allowed to go near the door it all goes back to the control thing

3868177 the world can be divided in many ways rich and poor democratic and authoritarian but one of the most striking is the divide between the societies with an individualist mentality and the ones with a collectivist mentality you can create a global continuum with the most individualistic societies like the united states or britain on one end and the most collectivist societies like china or japan on the other the individualistic countries tend to put rights and privacy first people in these societies tend to overvalue their own skills and overestimate their own importance to any group effort people in collective societies tend to value harmony and duty they tend to underestimate their own skills and are more self effacing when describing their contributions to group efforts individualistic societies have tended to do better economically but what happens if collectivist societies snap out of their economic stagnation a new sort of global conversation develops the opening ceremony in beijing was a statement in that conversation it was part of chinas assertion that development doesnt come only through western liberal means but also through eastern and collective ones its unlikely that the forces of individualism will sweep the field or even gain an edge the essence of a lot of the latest scientific research is that the western idea of individual choice is an illusion and the chinese are right to put first emphasis on social contexts the rise of china isnt only an economic event its a cultural one the ideal of a harmonious collective may turn out to be as attractive as the ideal of the american dream its certainly a useful ideology for aspiring autocrats
3868178 the individualistic countries tend to put rights and privacy first

3868186 you are a jew and i am a samaritan woman how can you ask me for a drink
3868187 if you knew the gift of god and who it is that asks you for a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
3868188 you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep where can you get this living water are you greater than our father jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself as did also his sons and his flocks and herds
3868189 everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again but whoever drinks the water i give him will never thirst indeed the water i give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life

3868192 i can see that you are a prophet our fathers worshiped on this mountain but you jews claim that the place where we must worship is in jerusalem
3868193 believe me woman a time is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem you samaritans worship what you do not know we worship what we do know for salvation is from the jews yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for they are the kind of worshipers the father seeks god is spirit and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth

3868195 reuters is deeply disturbed by a conclusion that would severely curtail the freedom of the media to cover the conflict by effectively giving soldiers a free hand to kill without being sure that they were not firing on journalists
3868196 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3868197 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3868198 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3868199 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response

3868215 the last couple of times the home games have let us down a little bit

3868251 russias attack on neighboring georgia over two tiny separatist provinces is really about something much bigger russian leader vladimir putins desire to restore the former ussrs might russias ill intentions clearly are on display in georgia in a fit of nationalist fury it wants to teach georgia and other former satellite countries that once made up the soviet bloc that its pro western rapprochement days are over what better way than to invade a former republic humiliate its leaders and then taunt the west for failing to come to its aid as if that wasnt enough russia immediately began threatening its other neighbors a top russian diplomat ominously warned monday that latvia estonia lithuania and poland would pay for criticizing russias imperialist policy toward georgia russias claim to support independence from georgia of tiny south ossetia and even tinier abkhazia is simply phony georgia with its strategically important oil pipeline has grown close to the u s even sending troops to iraq putin furious at growing u s and nato ties with eastern europe wanted to emasculate georgias military while deposing its pro american president mikheil saakashvili with his attack it looks like hes succeeding the symbolism of the invasion coming at the start of the beijing olympics is unmistakable this is russias wake up call to all of us communism may be dead putin is saying but russia isnt

3868270 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3868271 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3868272 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3868273 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3868274 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3868275 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3868276 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3868277 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3868278 at first he thought he was just being punched but soon realized he was bleeding excessively
3868279 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3868280 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3868281 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
3868282 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this

3868284 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3868285 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3868310 as far as i know because i havent gotten to speak with casey privately i believe shes told them everything she could possibly tell them to ensure the safety of caylee so naturally we encourage her all the time if she has any additional information to share again she does not know where caylee is at and that is the problem
3868311 i havent heard that theory out of their mouths today to me all of them theyre looking for a missing child and thats what im doing im looking for a missing child and thats what im asking the public to do is to look for that missing child because shes out there missing and theres no evidence that says otherwise and until that happens shes missing i believe that with 100 percent of my being that shes out there and theres a lot of people who believe that and thats the way the investigation is going

3868327 if saucier was overruled qualified immunity would not only continue to award government officials one free violation of the constitution but it also would pave the way for multiple bites of a constitutionally forbidden fruit
3868328 the mandatory nature of saucier ensures that although there will be no remedies against officials who violate the constitutional rights of individuals where the law is unclear the law will not remain unclear forever such that government officials like those in hill will be accountable
3868329 if the supreme court were to overrule saucier it would become even more difficult for people to get relief after they have been hurt by government violations of the constitution there is no reason to make things harder than they already are for these victims while letting the government official get away with violating the constitution

3868370 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
3868371 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
3868372 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
3868373 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
3868374 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us

3868380 going out raving linking up with my people linking up with my gal looking after my kids and walking the dog ive just been having fun living
3868381 looking back on it now at the time council estate of mind came out i dont really think there was anyone else out there acting as a voice for the frustrations of the youth and speaking on the social conditions they were living in
3868382 outside of my core audience some of the flattery i received from highly regarded critics in publications like
3868383 ive always been a great believer in charity and that was something i was first really made aware of by one of my heroes sir bob geldof back when i was young and he was doing things like live aid
3868384 seeing what was achieved through the power of music back then with live aid was something that really struck me
3868385 as i was making my way to the stage i came across this area with a big screen showing the work wateraid were doing to help the children in africa by giving them clean water
3868386 it also made me realise that with all of the problems the lower working class has to deal with here in the uk were still blessed in many ways with things like the nhs schools and pensions for the elderly
3868387 so if anyone wants to come rob me for the money they think ive got its already gone what you gonna kill me for my moneys been sent to those children across the world who need our help
3868388 i believe its a personal choice that one has to make i myself feel that ive been given the responsibility i feel that even if you dont think youre a role model you already are a role model because youre in the spotlight and people will be looking up to you now whether you want to be a good role model or a bad role model is up to the individual personally im motivated to make music so i can be a voice of the people and be someone that people can learn from rather than doing it to obtain superstardom or for any other reason
3868389 its the exact same energy i remember for example when i used to hear onyx slam and as soon as i heard the opening bars of that riddim my face would be screwing up and id have a big vein on my forehead the music just gave me that feeling and thats exactly what these kids are doing at the moment with grime i feel the exact same energy from these grime kids today as i used to get from the hip hop scene back then its the same thing and i really cant find a difference between the two i love it and its a beautiful evolution
3868390 yes theres definitely something in the pipeline thats under construction for presentation next year
3868391 the cover art i have in mind will depict the united nations leaders riding around the globe on a carousel
3868392 whereas council estate of mind was dealing with issues i was seeing in my immediate surroundings the new album will be dealing with bigger subject matter on a world scale
3868393 im probably going to oversee the production myself but as far as featured artists are concerned i would love to be able to work with chuck d and dead prez and also reach out to someone like shabazz the disciple
3868394 in the meantime im going to be releasing the smoking ban ep which is going to contain material that i felt didnt suit council estate of mind and that wouldnt suit the new album either its still material that i believe my fans will appreciate so why not give it to them the ep will have about ten or twelve tracks on there like warriors chant lady heroin and of course smoking ban its gonna be a lot im also doing an ep with mc trip called horrorcore and were going to be spitting some grimy lyrics over acid house
3868395 yeah i even want to sample shut up amp dance were going to be on some hip house vibe like doug lazy and fast eddie laughs my music will be going in all directions from now on as i dont have to stay focused on establishing myself as a hip hop artist anymore because ive done that now
3868396 back in the day when jungle was blowing up and you had emcees like navigator and creed i was thinking i can do this but it means ill buss as a junglist emcee and i didnt want to do that
3868397 i had to bite my tongue in nuff dances when i wanted to jump on the mic because i knew id be labelled as a jungle emcee and it was very important to me to come up under hip hop but now that ive done that i feel like i can branch out and do anything i want because ive already got the backpackers with me
3868398 there has been significant geopolitical activity but its not our role to upset it
3868399 weve never been welcomed so warmly other than in normandy
3868400 your friends are dicks and im supposed to ask you if you like crayons so would you like to go take a shot

3868512 they give you grip when it is raining you can walk for hours in them
3868513 i walked out to the hill just now it is exalting delicious to stand embraced by the shadows of a friendly tree with the wind tugging at your coattail and the heavens hailing your heart to gaze and glory and to give oneself again to god what more could a christian ask oh the fullness pleasure sheer excitement of knowing god on earth i care not if i never raise my voice again for him if only i may love him please him perhaps in mercy he shall give me a host of children that i may lead through the vast star fields to explore his delicacies whose fingers ends set them to burning but if not if only i may see him smell his garments and smile into my lovers eyes ah then not stars nor children shall matter only himself

3868525 capcom i m really pissed right now i want to play these games but you give us wii owners the shaft no re5 wii possibly no dead rising 2 no lost planet no flock no age of booty no street fighter 4 no devil may cry no dark void
3868526 we are contemplating versions of one or two of the cei titles you ve mentioned on the wii not saying which but we d like to see how they do on their initial target systems before doubling down on additional skus
3868527 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3868528 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3868529 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3868530 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3868531 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3868532 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3868533 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3868534 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3868535 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3868536 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3868542 my guess is for the near future that one wing of the building will probably be unusable
3868543 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3868544 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3868545 it is with deep regret that we find ourselves in circumstances that require us to reduce the work force this is a very dynamic time we are in i would characterize it as a struggle of epic proportions but we have a base of talented employees that are capable of rising to the challenge
3868546 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3868547 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3868553 this means greater national security cleaner environment and new jobs for nevada
3868554 the idea is we have one central program that identifies mccain voters where they are so that if we get them out on election day well win the state nevada is going to be a close race but im confident
3868555 if iowa is the play nice primary new hampshire is the play rough primary
3868556 contrast campaigns have often succeeded in new hampshire primary politics and more importantly they have dramatically reversed difficult spots
3868557 to win in nh we have to convince people that hillary does not just have the experience but she is the new beginning candidate they have been looking for that she is just as much as new ideas candidates as anyone and much more of the president they are looking for
3868558 i dont know that mark penn had a heck of a lot to do with the winning new hampshire strategy
3868559 she clinton understood that new hampshire voters make their minds up late in new hampshire and so she continued to do town hall meetings staying and answering every question she could showing an incredible breadth of knowledge on very substantive issues
3868560 new hampshire was won on the ground through voter to voter contact in those last five days

3868584 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3868585 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3868586 if we do not i can almost promise you nrg is going to be tired of the city and say were trying to give you some canals
3868587 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3868588 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3868589 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3868590 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3868591 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3868592 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3868593 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself

3868607 we understand that the u s is concerned about the fate of this project but the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3868608 no mention was made about what happened on august 8 when western leaders fell silent while tskhinvali was shelled and bombed
3868609 the western political elite only got excited when russia made the decision not to abandon its peacekeepers and to prevent ethnic cleansing sending reinforcements to carry out an operation to force georgia to accept peace

3868613 this photo is deeply offensive and racist its surprising that members of an olympic team preparing for the games in beijing of all places would show such poor judgement
3868614 the spanish olympic basketball teams owe a full and unconditional apology to their hosts to their fellow spanish citizens and to the people that they have offended and disappointed with this photo
3868615 professional sports teams spend an enormous effort working with children and communities to bridge understanding and promote harmony through sport and our teachers educate children about the serious impact of racism taunts and bullying gestures even if it is not intended
3868616 what happened was that during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked as to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
3868617 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture however some european media did not see it as such
3868618 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
3868619 im trying to figure things out im trying to see my kid talk to my wife blah blah
3868620 curious bank balance sheet profits lost 13bn bosses jobs lost zero
3868621 the outlook abroad is more than usually gloomy storms floods and hurricanes seem to be completing the devastation which unseasonable weather began in the united states and canada the heat is unusually severe and numerous deaths are already reported by sunstroke this early in the season
3868622 in europe this year 1879 so far has been unusually disastrous and there has been large losses of life and property by flood and fire we have had the most distressing accounts of the floods in hungary and elsewhere the eruption of mount etna the ravages of life by plague subsequent to the turco russian war the famine pestilence in india and now comes the prospect of cholera in russia
3868623 i guess if we had a leaning at all its cap and trade
3868624 right now we have the second lowest emissions among provinces and we are undertaking other green initiatives to ensure we tackle the global issue
3868625 in the end the 13 leaders decided to focus on lowering energy costs and overall demand committing to a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency by 2020 from coast to coast thats 12 years from now and just 20 per cent
3868626 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty
3868627 this will prove to be a very good first step
3868628 lebanon has seen far too many such attacks carried out and supported by those who prefer that lebanon be a place of fear and instability
3868629 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father
3868630 i virtually had no hope of ever knowing what happened to my dad
3868631 i wouldnt say ive processed it i think im still a little shell shocked by it all
3868632 i dont know that the military even looked for him
3868633 i guess they figured he was gone and thats about it
3868634 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us
3868635 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3868636 stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded
3868637 we were out at the mall with the with the kids then we came home and eight or nine police cars were there
3868638 theres a lot of contractors that come here and do work everything looks normal
3868639 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3868640 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3868641 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3868642 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3868643 while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3868644 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3868645 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3868646 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3868647 russian tanks are throwing people out of the houses pushing people into concentration camps
3868648 these are regular russian troops they go into houses they destroy houses there is all this documentary footage around that can prove it they are taking things like furniture toilet seats killing people terrorizing people
3868649 it western reaction has not been adequate theyre talking about a negotiated ceasefire how this side should do this this side should do that its appeasement
3868650 appeasement in 1938 brought tens of millions of deaths to europe
3868651 im sickened sickened of this cynical and absolutely unfounded allegation
3868652 what we are seeing is classical balkan type and world war two type of ethnic cleansing
3868653 that is called schizophrenia and what can you say to a schizophrenic
3868654 there is a different question of who there is to talk to when its clear that he is a sick man
3868655 when you really look at some of saakashvilis interviews given to television channels in the west do you think he is really winning the information war
3868656 he looked how should i say it somewhat stressed in those interviews i am not sure he really came across that well
3868657 theyve tried to cut off energy lines using their iskander missiles against pipelines cnn qualifies them as missiles of mass destruction
3868658 they also want to punish our democracy and thats where we find ourselves now
3868659 stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended to his law school days or beyond
3868660 i havent done anything since i was 20 years old
3868661 self reporting by people who have used drugs as to when they stopped is inherently unreliable
3868662 he said he was planning to aid several conservative groups that intend to run advertisements against mr
3868663 was not designed to be and does not set out to be a political book
3868664 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
3868665 a bump of roughly two fifths over the normal rate of receipts
3868666 one might be tempted to dismiss the importance of the colbert bump because it is just money
3868667 last year the oft made a commitment to deliver high impact outcomes that would provide real and significant benefits to consumers in the coming year we will continue to build on this commitment working closely with our partners and stakeholders focusing our resources on effective project delivery and carrying out evaluation of our work with the aim of delivering benefits for consumers in the most effective and efficient way while avoiding unnecessary burdens on business
3868668 i lost out on the medal because of a tactical error
3868669 it isnt easy to comeback after such a setback but my coach really motivated me and told me to believe in my instincts thats what i did
3868670 what makes me happy is the way i won i created a world record and i broke the 1 55s barrier as well
3868671 i am very happy to become the first slovenian swimmer to win a silver
3868672 world records in 100m freestyle this is one event where michael phelps isnt taking part this is the event where there is a chance for others to go for the gold
3868673 i couldnt have stopped and pulled it away form my eyes as soon as i dove in it was filled up
3868674 going into the 150 wall and the finish i couldnt see anything
3868675 i went blind so i just let it not disturb me i remained focused and started to count my strokes i am very good at that i was just hoping that i was winning
3868676 i was upset it happened but i did my best and won the gold
3868677 i knew i could go faster than this i hope i will do better next time
3868678 your son will never be able to focus on anything
3868679 i have to remain focused all the time i have to take one race at a time
3868680 it is pretty big to stay focus this is my third olympics and i have already swum in world championships and major meets so i have got used to it these things helped me to develop an unwavering focus
3868681 i am and read out a text message he received from close a friend before wednesdays first race
3868682 when abhinav fired the first shot in the sighting time practice time it hit the target between the fourth and fifth rings it is unthinkable of any shooter competing at this level to score 4 5 points but he remained calm and corrected the angle of his sight and the end result is in front of you
3868683 yes it happened and i also came to know about it through the media but he remained focused and overcame all odds
3868684 there is no point blaming anyone and 8230 how can this happen even if such a thing has happened no indian was there to do it only the shooter and his coach were there
3868685 he did tell use later that his gun sight was altered sethi also said that there was no point raking up a controversy
3868686 shooters themselves need to be more careful and take care of their guns
3868687 handle the batteries weight dissipate their heat and mechanically transfer their power to the wheels
3868688 if your not failing youve stopped dreaming youll eventually stop learning and you will stop growing

3868703 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
3868704 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
3868705 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
3868706 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
3868707 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
3868708 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
3868709 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3868710 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
3868711 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
3868712 with thousands of policies sold in missouri this is a positive development for consumers and funeral homes in our state
3868713 i thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car
3868714 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff
3868715 evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
3868716 stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
3868717 ive heard he said something do to about losing a job he didnt threaten anyone
3868718 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3868719 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3868720 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3868721 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3868722 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3868723 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3868724 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3868725 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3868726 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie

3868738 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3868739 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3868740 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3868741 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3868742 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3868743 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3868744 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

3868750 this stat is according to a recent study did by essence magazine i heard about this stat on tyra banks what do you guys think about that i guess this is why there are so many forums as it relates to ir dating here on the aa topix i really do feel it has to do with appearance skin tone and hair length and texture the whole comparance thing between black women and none black women has been taken to another level by not only society but black men as well i guess i dont know if black men wanting none black women has more to do with just their preference which i am totally o k with or as some black women have suggested it has to do with self hatred i mean come on 73 that is fairly large number
3868751 what did white men stop smashing black women and girls all of a sudden
3868752 this stat is according to a recent study did by essence magazine i heard about this stat on tyra banks what do you guys think about that i guess this is why there are so many forums as it relates to ir dating here on the aa topix i really do feel it has to do with appearance skin tone and hair length and texture the whole comparance thing between black women and none black women has been taken to another level by not only society but black men as well i guess i dont know if black men wanting none black women has more to do with just their preference which i am totally o k with or as some black women have suggested it has to do with self hatred i mean come on 73 that is fairly large number
3868753 what did white men stop smashing black women and girls all of a sudden
3868754 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
3868755 but not everything has been his fault at nashville he had a broken suspension and everybody thought he crashed so hes had some tough luck especially in places where he was going to be really good in the race
3868756 but for me where ive been really most proud is that probably 80 percent of the time this season the setups for all four agr drivers have drifted to what he developed and i think thats what has been really impressive last year at this time he was starting to get it down but if you look at where he was at the beginning of last year to where he is now its like two different people
3868757 im not sure i want to really be racing against marco
3868758 then its like a mixed feeling you still want him to do well but hes on another team
3868759 maybe it would be good for him in a way just because everybody thinks the dad thing that maybe hes being coddled and all that but i can assure you on this team its something i have to control myself because sometimes im too hard on him hes definitely not being coddled
3868760 we obviously want to be signed as soon as possible
3868761 this is where my heart lies with this team they brought me into the game its exactly where i feel at home and where i think i can do big things
3868762 theres nobody else i want to win with more than my father i think we have the resources within the team to allow me to follow through on my ultimate goals win the indy 500 and the championship and just win races
3868763 i was just asked the question would it be good for him to go and see another side another team maybe from the standpoint of growing and seeing the grass isnt always greener from that standpoint it probably wouldnt be bad for him to do it
3868764 but from the other side we really feel that hes on the verge of being a major player in every race i really believe that
3868765 hes got all the tools and its all starting to come together youd hate to lose that
3868766 i mean im already at the top as far as the top team in open wheel racing in america
3868767 if an opportunity would present itself in formula one the right one which im not sure would
3868768 it has to be one of the top three teams
3868769 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3868770 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3868771 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth
3868772 i look as if i could work in a library
3868773 it was an opportunity to promote and provide education to women and men were all sexual beings and need to move beyond shame i want people to feel comfortable here

3868783 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3868784 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3868785 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3868786 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3868787 weve got a good sized rally but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3868788 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there
3868789 i dont think people are going to change their commuting habits that fast
3868790 we have a productive active dialogue going on with our bondholders
3868791 shes been interviewed but at this point she has not been charged in this investigation
3868792 at this point no one is under arrest for this theft

3868795 i was a bit pessimistic about this dam forming and i was down last week actually and i was really quite startled

3868797 if people were landing planes or rafting down the alsek that thered be a pretty outrageous surprise at some point
3868798 the inspector general of police igp has put all modalities in place as far as police is concerned likewise other security agencies
3868799 everybody is fully aware and doing everything possible to make sure that the final hand over of the remaining part of bakassi to cameroun is successful
3868800 as far as i am concern the federal government had lived up to expectation for the bakassi resettlement programme last year it released the sum of n1 billion to them
3868801 is binding on both nigeria and cameroun which are sovereign members of the united nations
3868802 the exchange of territories including bakassi peninsular under the auspices of the united nations will happen on thursday across the country
3868803 this handing over process as painful as it is for everyone including the president is a commitment we have made to the international community and we have a responsibility to keep to it
3868804 the attorney general of the federation who will formalise the hand over process has made it very clear that he would rely on the march 19 2004 ruling of the federal high court delivered by justice s j adah
3868805 i am not a lawyer but i have been told that nigerias legal system has provisions for this kind of situation where courts of concurrent jurisdiction would give different ruling on the same issue i am also aware that the federal government last week formally sought and obtained the certified true copy of justice adahs ruling

3868811 livestock production is one of the major causes of the worlds most pressing environmental problems including global warming land degradation air and water pollution and loss of bio diversity using a methodology that considers the entire commodity chain it estimates that livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions a bigger share than that of transport

3868814 successful aging is a lot of the time defined in terms of cognitive or physical functioning and its usually inevitable that those things will decline but this shows that the really key components of successful aging may be how happy you are and how satisfied you are with your life and these factors dont tend to decline with age
3868815 intelligence is a really highly valued resource in our society and is closely linked with our life satisfaction

3868817 but they never saw her face organizers passed the song off as being sung by lin miaoke another perky schoolgirl who donned a sparkly red dress and soared on wires above the 91 000 strong crowd at the birds nest stadium
3868818 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3868819 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3868820 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3868821 the romanian daily 7plus ran this on its front page
3868822 new york magazine called on record executives to give peiyi a record deal saying
3868823 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3868824 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3868825 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3868826 the secret of peiyi was revealed sunday by the ceremonys musical director chen qigang in a radio interview he said a senior politburo member had said after the final dress rehearsal that miaokes voice was not good enough and that peiyi did not look right
3868827 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3868828 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3868829 officials sought to avoid the idea that peiyi did not appear because she was judged to be not cute enough suggesting instead that the two girls were a sum greater than their parts

3868881 it brings the whole u n organization together in partnership with iraq and its people to reduce poverty foster growth and consolidate democracy in our country
3868882 had this been a year ago you would have seen retribution attacks

3868898 its a challenging car to drive more of a challenge than a nationwide series car
3868899 its got a lot more horsepower and its a lot more top heavy and it doesnt handle as well in the corners you have to drive it a lot harder but its fun with that rear wing because you can lay it out on the line and that rear wing will catch you a little bit

3868928 ill tell you the problem with the scientific power that youre using here it didnt require any discipline to attain it you read what others had done and you took the next step you didnt earn the knowledge for yourselves so you dont take any responsibility for it you stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew what you had you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and now youre selling it you want to sell it
3868929 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3868930 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic

3868943 this is our priority we will proceed as soon as possible
3868944 during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most its disappointing that the obama campaign has chosen to launch inflammatory and baseless political attacks
3868945 it is the absolute height of hypocrisy for the mccain campaign to play the victim after launching attack after attack on barack obama for his strong and appropriate response to the conflict in georgia but its characteristic of the old washington tactics that have failed the american people
3868946 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home
3868947 but too many voters are concerned about obamas experience and dont yet have enough confidence in his ability to lead
3868948 when this crisis began barack obama the administration indeed and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
3868949 john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement and he may or may not have complicated the situation
3868950 and thats in part because we have been focused on iraq and our foreign policy has now become monolithic
3868951 guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time

3868955 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3868956 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3868957 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3868958 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3868959 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3868960 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3868961 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3868962 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3868963 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach

3868969 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3868970 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3868971 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3868972 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

3868976 they went out in the afternoon as my sister in law had to do some shopping for rakhi everything was fine we were all looking forward to the long weekend when suddenly around 7 30 pm we got to know about the accident
3868977 the armed forces of the philippines and the philippine national police are conducting further clearing operations in the affected areas of north cotabato to ensure that there are no more hazards that may pose danger to lives and properties
3868978 with optimism we foresee that sooner the dispossessed residents in north cotabato will be able to return to their homes and normalcy will be restored in these areas
3868979 meanwhile addressing the concerns of the internally displaced persons ipds remains our top priority while the residents are awaiting their safe return to their homes we have started to infuse the humanitarian assistance and disaster response in coordination with the local government authorities
3868980 pnp and afp medical teams are working closely with local government units in providing assistance to displaced persons some evacuees of the cleared barangays have started coming back but only to check on their properties
3868981 about the sudden influx of returning residents because our troops have discovered a booby trap in one of the cleared barangays
3868982 there was also a foiled attempt by milf renegade forces under commander ameril umbra kato to take control of a stretch of national highway particularly midsayap kabacan highway
3868983 the pnp is also strengthening the defense system in areas not affected by the conflict to prevent incursions from repositioning renegades particularly the flanks bounded by maguindanao province and shariff kabunsuan district
3868984 while continuous clearing operations are being conducted to sanitize the entire area our hopes remain anchored on all possible peaceful solutions to every issue that led to this incident
3868985 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3868986 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3868987 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3868988 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3868989 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3868990 just so you all know we did set a record
3868991 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3868992 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3868993 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3868994 obama was the editor of his class harvard law review bushs daddy bought his way into yale where he graduated in history
3868995 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3868996 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3868997 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3868998 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3868999 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3869000 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3869001 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3869002 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3869003 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3869004 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3869005 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3869006 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

3869022 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3869023 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3869024 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3869025 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3869026 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3869027 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3869028 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

3869030 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3869031 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3869032 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3869033 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3869034 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

3869165 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3869166 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices

3869168 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3869169 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

3869173 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3869174 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3869175 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3869176 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

3869214 the world community also has a moral responsibility to bring china into the mainstream of world democracy
3869215 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3869216 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3869217 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth
3869218 the reasons that women most frequently cite for terminating a pregnancy include not being ready to care for a child or another child at that time financial inability to care for a child concern for or responsibility to others desire to avoid single parenthood relationship problems and feeling too young or immature to raise a child
3869219 some pregnancies are terminated because they are a consequence of rape or incest very few fewer than 1 percent women cite coercion from others as a major reason for their abortion

3869229 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3869230 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3869231 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3869232 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3869233 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3869234 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3869235 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable

3869255 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3869256 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

3869502 exxon mobil is padding the pockets of speculators where they should focus on u s production
3869503 instead of idly watching the american economy suffocate under the weight of gas prices exxon needs to spend significantly more on research and development in the vast areas where they are already permitted to drill and have failed to take any action
3869504 suddenly this once republican town is voting democratic in off years

3869523 at the end of the day we are all patients and we want to be sure there are adequate numbers of qualified neurosurgeons to take care of us and our loved ones strokes brain tumors back and neck pains
3869524 the paper touches on the fact that the number of neurosurgeons appears to be decreasing relative to a growing population and that there is an urgent need to attract more qualified candidates to address this potential shortage
3869525 this is an issue that affects the specialty as a whole and inevitably our patients and we intend to work together to resolve it
3869526 there are also some instances where there are no role models

3869539 republican candidates continue to post impressive fundraising numbers in some of the most competitive races in the country
3869540 it is time that voters in the 25th district have the opportunity to hear from both candidates on the substantive issues facing our region
3869541 voters are tired of just hearing about politics they want to know what we have to say about the issues i have already been discussing the economy the war and the environment and telling voters where i stand on a variety of issues given the vast differences between me and my opponent voters need to see us share a stage and explain our positions
3869542 i think its important to let the voters ask us questions we should make these events town hall style to encourage maximum participation
3869543 voters of the 25th congressional district are about to elect a new representative to congress and those voters need to know if who they elect will continue down the same path or as i have proposed head in a new direction with new ideas
3869544 the text of the letter which was hand delivered to sweetland is below
3869545 none of us believe that government can solve all of our problems but we all demand that government create a system in which we can solve our own
3869546 a congress who over the past years have rubber stamped this presidents agenda to the point where america now almost 3 to 1 is saying its time to go in a new direction

3869548 it is time that voters in the 25th district have the opportunity to hear from both candidates on the substantive issues facing our region
3869549 voters are tired of just hearing about politics they want to know what we have to say about the issues i have already been discussing the economy the war and the environment and telling voters where i stand on a variety of issues given the vast differences between me and my opponent voters need to see us share a stage and explain our positions
3869550 i think its important to let the voters ask us questions we should make these events town hall style to encourage maximum participation
3869551 voters of the 25th congressional district are about to elect a new representative to congress and those voters need to know if who they elect will continue down the same path or as i have proposed head in a new direction with new ideas

3869569 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy
3869570 ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3869571 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating
3869572 now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3869573 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3869574 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3869575 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3869576 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3869577 its very difficult to fill the space not only because of his contributions with the bat and ball but also because of his impact in the dressing room
3869578 we are not doing too badly its just we are losing the key games
3869579 we shouldnt be too high or too low in confidence well try to keep a positive frame of mind
3869580 we just need to make sure that we get our game plans right
3869581 professor colmans discovery ranks with that of john cade who discovered lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder
3869582 the terrorist explosion directly targets the army and peaceful co existence in the country
3869583 the army and security forces will not be terrorised by attacks and crimes that target it and civil society and the history of the army attests to that
3869584 syria staunchly denounces the criminal act perpetrated this morning in tripoli that killed many innocent civilians
3869585 aimed at complicating the security and political situation in lebanon and hampering the launch of the new government
3869586 theres a huge amount of research now showing people have a preference for attractive people from birth to death
3869587 babies prefer attractive faces and adults treat attractive babies better
3869588 our happiness levels seem to be pre set in life
3869589 good relationships can improve happiness but attractive people arent any better at them than others
3869590 public service professions are vital to creating the kinds of vibrant communities where people want to stay and raise their families
3869591 we have so much talent and experience right here in upstate new york thats why its important that we foster an atmosphere that encourages people to enter vital service professions like teaching nursing and other careers
3869592 americans and western new yorkers specifically have always proven themselves to be generous and hard working
3869593 starting today we need to tap into the energy and creativity of our citizens to tackle our nations most trying problems by attracting our best and brightest into professions like teaching nursing and social work we can ensure secure long term jobs here in western new york helping to reverse our brain drain
3869594 we have a real plan to help create needed jobs in western new york
3869595 todays discussion was about how we as the future leaders of this region will work together to get results for working families every american has the right to a quality and affordable college education and a good job with solid benefits and we have a great plan to do just that
3869596 home packages help older australians continue to live in their own homes and remain independent and active

3869601 i was an immigrant a poor man a losah like you sitting on the couch dreaming of being rich in america
3869602 vu was one of the great tacky tributes to 80s greed
3869603 you are not fat you are just carrying around ten pounds of fecal build up in your intestines
3869604 here the proposed draft was provided we politely reviewed it said thanks but no thanks and ultimately decided to go another way
3869605 this is a good old boy system that is killing the rights of consumers
3869606 to say we have been in collusion with someone over this brief is not correct and unfair
3869607 we are not taking a side the governor hopes that the people deserving of medical monitoring receive the medical monitoring that they need
3869608 governor manchin just showed us hes more concerned with big business in west virginia than with the health and well being of our families and children
3869609 maybe governor manchin should come here and try to explain his actions
3869610 just the simplest things bother me allergies a runny nose on a daily basis it worries and bothers me
3869611 might feel different maybe if his own family members were involved
3869612 the governor made his own judgment based on the issues
3869613 and his office wrote and filed their own brief with the west virginia supreme court
3869614 this is a high profile high dollar case so i can imagine that feelings and tempers may be fairly high
3869615 but from our point of view it is not unusual for this governor or other governors to participate in matters that are before the courts that have a direct impact on west virginia it is certainly not indicative of corruption
3869616 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in
3869617 one could argue is it worth as much as they paid for it initially based on todays market
3869618 so the bottom line is theyre holding on for the long term and well see what happens
3869619 i dont know what happens in three years or what he says in five years or whatever but those discussions we dont get involved in
3869620 im tremendously disappointed weve been here nearly five years we have lots of friends and family
3869621 but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we go
3869622 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives
3869623 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3869624 the time has come for me to step down and leave public office
3869625 ive been a part of public policy for twenty years at one level or another and i think its natural its a natural progression it gives you the experience of being able to listen to people make decisions and stand by those decisions
3869626 to put ourselves back on the map back on the economic map nationwide and back on the map of young people young professionals who may leave the area as i did once but may have an opportunity to come back and convince them and convince us in central new york that this can be a wonderful place to raise a family and a wonderful place to do business and a wonderful place just to live
3869627 they only talk amongst themselves to their staffers and they get insulated and they forget what its like to live in the real world its a mess washington is broken
3869628 im one of these folks i dont pretend to be anyone else
3869629 my opponent has spent the majority of his adult life as a staffer in the halls of congress and that experience is not the real world
3869630 the idea that somehow if you go somewhere else and you achieve things other places that youre disqualified from serving your own community thats ridiculous
3869631 and if thats true then were not going to have the kind of representation in washington that this community really needs to really thrive because we do need a congressman who knows what hes doing that can find his office and knows how to get things done and not just sit there and introduce bills that dont go anywhere
3869632 i wouldnt want to run for county executive or mayor or governor those positions wouldnt suit my particular qualities
3869633 but this job i do believe i can make a contribution maybe where nobody else can im not a huge ego i dont believe that i know anyone elses business but this particular job i have really the best kind of background for and the best energy to do it and that its maybe a calling
3869634 ive always done the work put my head down and said im going to do the best i can
3869635 im going to make darn sure i can look myself in the mirror every morning and live up to what my grandfather and my father thought i should be
3869636 by the time i went to my 10th high school reunion most of my classmates had left
3869637 maffeis fundraising advantage and exposure has led cq politics to change its rating on the race to leans democrat from no clear favorite
3869638 voters are clearly responding to my message of change and a new direction for upstate new york
3869639 they are tired of the policies of the past that have hurt hard working men and women and caused this area to lose thousands of jobs we can do better we must do better in order to make our region a place where people can stay and raise their families
3869640 i hope youll join us in toasting our 100th year of doing what matters to california and to the world
3869641 we are making it come alive and while were making it fun we are not losing sight of the importance
3869642 the idea is were making a difference in your community so come visit ours
3869643 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3869644 weve got a good sized rally but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3869645 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there
3869646 i dont think people are going to change their commuting habits that fast
3869647 i was very surprised to hear he was coming out with tv ads so early
3869648 it tells me his three or four year campaign has not really taken effect in the 25th congressional district i think his name recognition is low i think his campaign is truly worried
3869649 its impossible for us to raise 900 000 before the election lets be real
3869650 but this race isnt about which candidate has the fattest wallet what we have is a very good platform and a candidate who can express himself in a way that leaves no question who the better candidate is
3869651 im deeply humbled by the strong grass roots support my campaign is receiving
3869652 i am certain that our support will continue to grow and we will achieve victory in november
3869653 but unlike our opponent who has raised most of his money in washington and new york city were going to represent the people of central new york
3869654 voters dont care about that what dan maffei cares about and what voters care about is bringing good paying jobs back to central new york
3869655 unfortunately the opposition seems to be turning this race into who has the most money
3869656 but its about the candidate its about the candidate whos going to do the most for upstate new york
3869657 now im running for congress because i know if we stay and fight together we can make upstate new york great again
3869658 we have a mountain to climb we have four months to make this happen but fortunately what we have with dale sweetland is he has a proven record of public service when you meet dale sweetland you would ask yourself why cant all of our candidates give me this feel of honor and integrity and hard work
3869659 were setting up events and just getting dale sweetland in front of the people
3869660 we dont have some washington firm doing all our filing data for us so we dont have all of our final numbers just yet
3869661 were going to see some positive activity out of washington
3869662 this decision was made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our portfolio and enables us to maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
3869663 it is clear that russian military is continuing combat operations despite the agreement in areas far from south ossetia
3869664 this isnt a time for partisanship and sniping hundreds if not thousands of innocent people whose lives are being taken and who are being driven from their homes
3869665 almost 25 percent of what we pay today goes to someone other than the oil companies and we could lower those taxes and that would be short term relief
3869666 this is a candidate and campaign management training day to give people the basic idea of what they would need to do to run
3869667 we want to build the confidence to go out there and get involved
3869668 we want littlebigplanet to lead the charge into a new genre of gaming and turn sackboy into the next emblematic character for the ps3
3869669 we believe voters are anxious to hear what candidates have to say now and not later
3869670 i think voters need to realize theyll be electing a new congressman for the first time in 20 years
3869671 we need to be able to communicate dans message of change and a new direction for central and upstate new york to as many people as possible between now and november
3869672 voters are anxious to hear what the candidates have to say now not later dan maffei wants to get his message about jobs and a new direction for upstate new york out to the voters every chance he gets the ads will tell dans story and begin to lay out his plans to bring jobs back to central and upstate new york
3869673 i have traveled across this district countless times and talked to so many people over the last several months and i learned so much
3869674 we need jobs we need to rein in soaring gas prices and we need to finally end the war in iraq most people agree with my message and thats why i have garnered such strong financial support there is no doubt this region has suffered tremendously over the past eight years but the people of this district are resilient and i know we can do better if we have the courage to change
3869675 is he says do what the oil companies want and somehow thatll help consumers i dont believe we can do that any longer we cant be both with big oil and with consumers
3869676 windfall profits of oil companies yeah and oil companies are making a lot of money on the other hand i dont think any of these folks behind me will disagree that if oil companies are taxed more heavily theyll just say ok
3869677 its a lot of points its not a drop in the bucket
3869678 what dan maffei neglects to mention in his ad is that he worked as a capitol hill staffer for the author of the very tax policies that crippled businesses in his own hometown
3869679 i think it is safe to say that he is out of touch with the interests and values of the district he wants to represent
3869680 there is an incredible mountain that we have to scale
3869681 in all my years on campaigns i have never seen radio or tv spots come out right after the fourth
3869682 its surprising but its a good sign that they are concerned
3869683 he really hasnt experienced the struggle a lot of us have
3869684 we are in the perfect position to be the leaders in getting ourselves off of the addiction of oil
3869685 on the other hand if oil companies are taxed more heavily they wont just say well suck that up and we wont pass that on to all of us at the gas pump
3869686 my plan takes the power away from big oil by taxing their huge windfall profits and eliminating the unconscionable subsidies they receive
3869687 it would reinvest the money into alternative and renewable fuels so we can end our dependence on foreign oil
3869688 here in onondaga county we can say from experience that these schemes simply do not work
3869689 congress should have done it years ago so that supply would be there for us today
3869690 i dont think you can have a solution to the energy crisis without standing up to the oil companies
3869691 what benefit have we gotten out of our ridiculous ethanol initiatives
3869692 the way to continue our fight now to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy and our passion our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states
3869693 i think we will see all of new york follow because the republicans under george w bush and it would continue with john mccain its been horrendous for new york particularly for upstate new york
3869694 if they believed in hillary clinton as a candidate then once theyre over feeling hurt that senator clinton didnt make it to become the nominee i think she can rally them in support of senator obama
3869695 senator obama has to show that hes very pro small business that hes very pro economic development that were going to see a lot of public private partnerships and cooperation with business and government
3869696 last week my opponent announced his support for big oil and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge
3869697 companies like exxon mobil are not interested in lowering gas prices as their actions clearly demonstrated yesterday its time to make a choice are you for big oil or are you on the side of consumers i choose the consumer
3869698 the rockefeller family recognizes the need to move in a different direction why cant my opponent
3869699 drilling in anwr would be great for companies like exxon mobil but would do nothing for you and me its time to give people real solutions including developing alternative and renewable fuels we as a region are uniquely positioned to capitalize on investments in these technologies
3869700 but while knowledge makes us feel important it is love that strengthens the church and anyone who claims to know all the answers doesnt really know very much but the person who loves god is the one whom god recognizes
3869701 i want to thank forbes for waking us up and showing us how great our city can be
3869702 this will help in mitigating the global food crisis we are sure that it will work wonders
3869703 it will save half our grain and will also reduce villagers dependence on food stock
3869704 the only issue is how people react to rat meat but i think it will not be a problem
3869705 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
3869706 rat meat will make up nutrition deficiencies among villagers since rats are a major source of protein
3869707 they were nice it was a little scary at first but the people out there are just normal people like we are god loves homeless people it makes me appreciate what i have i want to help them more i feel sorry for the homeless people
3869708 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
3869709 the most important thing about memorial day is that we do honor our fallen but also our living veterans one of the best ways we can do that is pass a full gi bill that would do that same kind of thing for our new veterans as we did for our world war ii and korea veterans
3869710 for too long the federal government has short changed our schools districts forcing local property taxes to skyrocket
3869711 its time congress stepped up and did the right thing to make our schools safe modern and efficient so our kids can get the education they need to succeed
3869712 the only energy policy they have is to drill for more oil we need a whole new approach to energy in this country and the green schools initiative is a good start it will help our schools it will help us use energy more efficiently and it will save us money its a new way of dealing with an old problem and thats why i support it
3869713 the 660 billion our nation spent on defense in 2007 was the most since 1945
3869714 these two aspects of defense spending have accounted for more than 4 percent of total rural u s economic growth
3869715 america is at a tipping point and central new york is at a tipping point we in this room have been talking about and fighting for change for so many years well ladies and gentlemen change is here it is happening now it is inevitable
3869716 this bad idea would do nothing to lower gas prices anytime in the foreseeable future and is a clear example of why our current energy policy has failed us so completely its time to break our dependence on foreign oil and on fossil fuels in general by investing in alternative and renewable fuels that hold so much promise and would help drive the future of our local economy
3869717 i think walsh made the right decision we need to use all the tools that we can a comprehensive plan needs to be put together we know there is oil there i believe we can drill responsibly we can be environmentally safe we can lay out a plan to sensibly go about drilling in anwr and then add to that the alternative energy industry and other technologies to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
3869718 it is an affront to the bill of rights in particular the 10th amendment to prohibit alaska from tapping into its own natural resources beyond the adverse effect to the alaskan economy this violation of the constitution has driven gasoline prices to unbearable levels causing economic strife to every american i think it is appalling that we allow cuba and china to drill in the florida straits meanwhile forbidding our own selves from seeking the common good in this case a way to lower the price of gasoline
3869719 this is one of the single most important issues facing the country and the voters of this district deserve to know where the candidates running for congress stand in clear unequivocal terms
3869720 i would have voted in favor of continuing to support our troops in iraq and give them what they need but i would have also voted for the other key parts of this bill to begin the withdrawal of our troops to force the iraqi government to shoulder more of the costs of this unending war and to give our returning troops the kind of educational benefits they deserve
3869721 our veterans deserve whatever help we can give them as they return to civilian life
3869722 there always seem to be some politicians who support our troops when theyre heading off to war but dont want to do anything to help them when they come home i think thats wrong
3869723 how can you say this is the most important battle of our time and then not even bother to vote yes or no on funding the troops
3869724 the republicans cant even figure out where they stand on the war anymore they need to have the courage of their convictions vote to fund the war or not fund the war but dont vote present thats a cop out
3869725 we keep pouring billions of dollars into that country and at some point we have to turn the spigot off
3869726 we need that money here at home its long past time the iraqi government stepped up and shouldered their fair share of the costs of this unending war
3869727 all my former colleagues in the local media must be wondering where did he go wrong
3869728 regrettably in many cases the emphasis has changed from the desire to provide a needy child with a home to that of providing a needy parent with a child as a result a whole industry has grown generating millions of dollars of revenue each year
3869729 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
3869730 anyone who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without feminine upheaval social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex the ugly ones included
3869731 the individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe

3869746 as far as i know i was ill or out of town for my regular job
3869747 the war in iraq is a shame if i had been in congress at the time i probably wouldnt have voted to go to iraq
3869748 this is one of the single most important issues facing the country and the voters of this district deserve to know where the candidates running for congress stand in clear unequivocal terms
3869749 if somehow people think the way to force the withdrawal is to not fund supplies and equipment to the troops thats the wrong thing to do
3869750 ill look to the military leaders for advice on whether the job in iraq is done whether weve accomplished all we can accomplish how do we withdraw when do we withdraw and what gets left behind
3869751 the question is whether or not our leadership in washington in the political arena will listen to them
3869752 i am honored to have the support of so many people who share a vision that brings new ideas for the people of upstate new york
3869753 for too long central new york has suffered a slow and steady economic decline and our elected leaders have been unable to find solutions its time for this to change i was born and raised right here in central new york and i know firsthand the issues we face and the need to bring good paying jobs with benefits to our region
3869754 this government really is failing its veteran and has been for a number of years now and something needs to be done about it
3869755 between 2005 and 2006 the number of veterans returning seeking primary care nearly doubled from 15 000 to 30 000 wait times are longer than 6 months some for soldiers with ptsd that is unacceptable
3869756 i send numerous e mails and make numerous phone calls on a weekly basis just trying to manage my healthcare if you dont have the time or the measures to do that a lot of people just give up
3869757 mandatory full funding of the veterans administration this is a legislative concept that takes the funding of the va out of the discretionary budget and makes it mandatory
3869758 we felt that if we get in there early and were able to explain to our working men and women what the issues are what the candidates stand is on the issues that candidate has a better chance of getting the vote of union members in this district
3869759 the working people of this community know that because of this endorsement they know that i am the candidate thats going to really create jobs and make sure that there are really good jobs in this area good jobs that will attract young people attract new business in the future thats the key and the earlier that message can be delivered the better
3869760 i believe the middle class are the engine of americas economy and when they prosper and have confidence in the future we succeed
3869761 george bush and his allies still think the economy is doing fine and they are dead set against any change i recognize that our economy has changed and that even the basic rules for middle class prosperity and security have changed with it my plan is aimed at getting our economy moving and to restoring prosperity and confidence
3869762 this is going to be a tremendous campaign this is going to be a campaign for change a new direction in central new york the fact that all of you are here today on a cold snowy day having left your televisions and the carrier dome just minutes before just honors me tremendously
3869763 if you see a fork in the road take it

3869773 we have always said that in order to keep louisiana safe we need both to strengthen the levees we have now and restore the wetlands and coastal areas that serve as our natural hurricane barriers
3869774 this new plan fulfills both of those priorities we congratulate governor jindal and everyone who worked with him to develop the plan for a job well done
3869775 the state has done a great job with this proposal but now the federal government needs to step up to the plate and provide its share of the funding that is already authorized for restoration projects
3869776 we will continue to work with the state and the u s army corps of engineers to get large scale restoration projects ready for funding and construction in upcoming federal and state budgets
3869777 this plan shows a substantial commitment to projects that will allow us to restore wetlands by using sediment that would otherwise have gone to waste
3869778 the barrier islands act as a speed bump for storm surge and wave energy
3869779 at the end of the day this race is going to be about making sure central new york has a new economy regardless of how much money is raised
3869780 i dont think its a game to say who can raise the most money
3869781 in the end its a method of spending the money wisely and making a connection with voters weve seen races before where people have been outspent and somebody has surprised them
3869782 being able to raise money is going to be very important i have experience raising money
3869783 actually some other people have come down theyve talked to me i havent heard anything yet this has been in the last three weeks but like i said its an open process
3869784 i think people saw maffei beating walsh in onondaga county and thought they could do it a lot of people are running where no one would try before
3869785 i have great respect for governor spitzer but i do not
3869786 i never thought i would stay in washington this long ever
3869787 for the last four or five years ive wrestled with the idea of retirement
3869788 a lot of people are disappointed and a lot of them are shocked
3869789 its going to take awhile for someone else from this area to be able to do these types of things
3869790 what will happen is that people will realize these are the golden days and theyre gone
3869791 i suspect theres going to be a lot of interest on both sides
3869792 i will be very generous to the republican party locally and nationally i will try to be very helpful to our candidate here and to the party
3869793 i voted to go to war and not to go to war i voted to impeach a president i witnessed our capital under attack i will never forget as long as i live seeing the pentagon on fire outside my office window
3869794 i want to come up with a plan now because i want voters to know what i intend to do in washington and want to be ready to act on a plan the moment i get there
3869795 for far too long congressman jim walsh has been playing politics with this failed war and our troops have suffered the consequences
3869796 this forum will give central new yorkers a chance to discuss their feelings and to show jim walsh there is true opposition to this failed war

3869802 i have natural hair and would love some suggestions on some really good deep conditioners my hair is super thick dense and curly and its still in the growing phase i have no idea what ill do once it starts to really grow out to ponytail length
3869803 in the past few years the sales tax weve collected through similar bond issues has paid for a new sports complex a new fire station and two new fire trucks
3869804 and that is just a short list of what this kind of tax has provided for the city
3869805 everyone pays it when they shop people who live in trumann pay it but also others that shop locally who dont live here help us fund these projects
3869806 we need to make these repairs to our water and sewer equipment in the city
3869807 we need to repair our streets right now our city does not have the funds to make these repairs
3869808 trumann is like every other small town in arkansas were trying to stretch our dollars as far as we can
3869809 but we do not have enough funds coming in to do all the projects that are necessary

3869815 its wonderful that through this campaign music that is so familiar to many people of my era will now be embraced by a whole new generation
3869816 johns music set out to inspire change and in standing up for human rights we really can make the world a better place
3869817 we know musics power to unite and inspire people with hundreds of thousands dead millions driven from their burned out villages and rape being used as a tactic in the darfur conflict the world needs a mass mobilization demanding action and justice the instant karma campaign combines john lennons passionate desire for us to imagine a more peaceful world with amnesty internationals expertise in achieving justice instant karma allows ordinary people to lend their hand in saving lives a notion we think would make john proud
3869818 john lennon was not just a famous beatle he was the social conscience of his generation
3869819 by reinterpreting his music and reintroducing it to a new generation we shine a light on the darkness that is darfur yoko onos gift of johns music to amnesty international whose work points out the pain and injustice in the world is a true beacon of light give peace a chance is all we are saying

3869924 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3869925 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3869926 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3869927 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3869928 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3869929 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

3869933 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3869934 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3869935 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3869936 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3869937 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3869938 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3869939 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3869940 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3869941 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3869942 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

3869957 i dont think we understood that even though we were little we could get help we didnt want to be pushy
3869958 he came right out and told us what to do
3869959 i didnt know about extension i didnt know about a lot of things
3869960 he spent the better part of half a day pointing out weeds we had a pretty significant leafy spurge population and explaining water rights and options for getting rid of the weeds
3869961 many people move to montana and buy 100 acres with the idea that they can farm or ranch
3869962 they have basic questions like how do i calve a cow or how do i get a field of hay started for my horses we needed ways to answer those questions and we think this website and magazine will be of real value to rural landowners newcomers and long timers alike
3869963 i dont know if this reaches the level of scandal but its certainly very close
3869964 and scandal has a way of diverting a companys attention and resources ultimately thats not good for shareholders
3869965 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3869966 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3869967 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3869968 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3869969 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3869970 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3869971 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3869972 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3869973 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3869974 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3869975 its for the kids i want to see them achieve more than they have
3869976 without me being in this program i never would have gotten the job
3869977 historically the schools serving native american children have not enjoyed the same levels of achievement as other schools in the state
3869978 we know from research that you cant have quality schools when you have high levels of administrative turnover
3869979 quality administrative leadership contributes as much to student achievement as quality teaching
3869980 for me you have to have a lot of theory behind how to be a leader
3869981 but the practical stuff has almost benefited me more because its about how to survive in the job
3869982 the first week was overwhelming but somebody has set those expectations up high and they believe we can do it so it must be possible its hard work but you feel good about it
3869983 we have a stake in our kids and a bigger stake than non indians do in our community
3869984 skin color goes a long way with people being comfortable talking with you
3869985 theyre more comfortable talking to another indian theres a comfort level talking to someone whos like you physically
3869986 it just opens the door for you to do some really great things with kids and families

3869993 how can someone say they support the troops and then vote against those troops when the come home
3869994 its time for all the politicians who pay lip service to supporting our troops put their money where their mouth is we owe a debt to our nations veterans and we are currently in default that is why this legislation is needed now
3869995 were pouring billions and billions of dollars into iraq every month the least we can do is allocate a tiny fraction of that money to make sure our returning veterans have access to college
3869996 after world war ii we recognized the huge debt we owed to our veterans and provided them with a g i bill that allowed them to get a good education and good job it ensured our economic prosperity for decades and for us to do less for veterans today is shameful
