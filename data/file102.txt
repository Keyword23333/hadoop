1020098 green party ministers should have the political integrity to stand over their position in relation to the corrib gas pipeline
1020099 when the strategic infrastructure bill was making its way through the oireachtas i warned that it would be used to push through the corrib gas pipeline project without proper consultation with the community affected
1020100 the decision of the department of the environment to grant planning permission without approval from an bord plean la to shell e amp p limited for a key section of the corrib onshore pipeline at glengad in county mayo shows that my concern at the time was fully warranted
1020101 this decision flies in the face of local democratic accountability and the legislation used to facilitate it was designed for exactly that purpose
1020102 both green party ministers should have the political integrity to stand over their position in relation to the corrib gas pipeline
1020103 there was some question about whether or not the group had a demonstration permit are law enforcement officers now imitating the oppressive tactics that are used in beijing or tehran the first amendment of the constitution is demonstration permit enough

1020110 given the training and the layers of security that chinas authorities have placed on beijing the ability for a conventional terrorist attack is quite severely curtailed
1020111 its clear that the government has taken every precaution possible to protect the olympic venues and those attending the olympics
1020112 it will be very difficult for the etim to mount attacks inside beijing because of the huge investment chinese have made
1020113 but outside beijing it is very difficult to protect from a terrorist attack

1020128 sure air travel is a hassle and no the u s dollar doesnt go very far in paris or london but none of that is keeping americans away from europe nearly 13 million americans visited europe in 2006 a 4 percent increase from the previous year according to preliminary data from the european travel commission expects those numbers will increase another 2 or 3 percent this year

1020130 the united kingdom and france each gets more tourists from the u
1020131 it is the considered belief of the opinion research corporation that the travel attitudes of the 549 persons were divided into two distinct feelings the travel centered and the home centered f or the travel centered traveling was an end in itself these people travel for the pleasure of the trip for the home centered part of the value of the trip is reliving it for friends and neighbors live and on film

1020158 as the attack on our embassy in kabul on july 7 has tragically shown terrorism has no barriers and is not bound by any restraints
1020159 it was an attack on the friendship between india and afghanistan we have agreed that we will not allow terrorism to stand in our way we will fight it unitedly and with full determination
1020160 challenges of terrorism of cold blooded brutal murderous activity in our two countries
1020161 were being clouded out by leadership issues rather than real issues and really at this time the labor government should frankly be on the nose
1020162 its going to be those guys that are involved in the longer distance events that are outside or training a lot outside that will be affected
1020163 if you are pregnant or nursing do not take this medication
1020164 my understanding is hes certainly said that he would respect those rules when hes in the venues and i hope thats the case
1020165 our position is that we respect the right of athletes to take a position on human rights all those matters weve given them the opportunity personally on blogs personally at conferences like this youre free to ask these athletes whatever questions you want here
1020166 should support the ioc rules that say no protests no banners flags within the village or at the venues
1020167 with some of these things the technology is so new the concept so bizarre that there would only be a handful of well tapped in athletes using them but they will be experimenting at the beijing olympics because they are the ultimate
1020168 the problem is that some of the drugs would now fly under the radar with the tattoo technique because athletes would be taking a much smaller dose it depends on the drug and how sensitive the analysers are
1020169 these mind clearing drugs have the ability to alter the emotions for instance sadness and shyness and so athletes would be very attracted to them
1020170 cera is out of the bag so the next epo version off the production line is hematide and with this drug patients take it every four to five weeks not every second day
1020171 we were blown away this is a drug that is like pharmacological exercise after four weeks of receiving the drug the mice were behaving as if theyd been exercised
1020172 hes put a lot of time and effort into it he went out for a ride yesterday with the group did five hours pain free and was really quite strong at the end everything indicates that he will get better with each day
1020173 as far as tactics for the race go that will be discussed once the team arrives in beijing
1020174 he evans may play more of a domestiques role or a workers role hes in the team thats the first step and well just see how it progresses from there id say that theres a fair chance that hell do more than just a workers role
1020175 at the moment were just really focusing on the road race and a lot really depends now on how he recovers from that
1020176 its a great honour to be the first reserve for the team and im happy i could do my bit for the australian effort
1020177 in the end i wasnt needed but thats good news because it means cadel is ready to race
1020178 its not like they were flashes in the pan these are guys who are jumping over 5 90m all the time its as good as mens pole vault has been in a long time
1020179 have you seen the way that brad and yevgeniy are jumping i think they are jumping good and i think im jumping good any one of us if we had good conditions the world record could go this year it could go next year who knows
1020180 we are in competitions where we are pushing each other up past six metres its been rare in the last few years that thered be more than one person in the competition over six metres and that looks like its going to be happening more and more
1020181 im pretty sure the olympics is going to get one over six metres for the first time because that pressure is going to be there from a number of competitors and not just a select few
1020182 physically and probably mentally i would say he is in the best shape ever
1020183 technically every six months he is improving maybe physically he was pretty much in the same shape last year and he jumped well in europe
1020184 now mentally he is better and technically as well i strongly believe to win it is going to take six metres to win the olympics and maybe six plus
1020185 but i feel that sooner or later its going to happen in steves career
1020186 litany of lies about the disappearance of her newborn daughter police have started digging for tegan lanes corpse under a house in gladesville
1020187 she has told untruths to many people about what she did with the child the identity of the father and where the child is or might be now
1020188 disturbed at the possibility that tegan may have met with foul play
1020189 it was just the shock of knowing there were additional children that had been adopted out
1020190 she didnt want to disappoint the family she was held in very very high esteem by her family she still is
1020191 it is very disappointing and its not good for sydney
1020192 you cant take an office park mentality with these huge office blobs and put that in the middle of the city we will end with some very dumpy buildings there we cannot let the development industry dictate the outcome
1020193 the physical failings include the continuing lack of any commitment to creating a quality public domain no firm proposals for public transport or integration with the city no cultural program and a strong bias towards a monoculture of bulky office buildings to the exclusion of other uses
1020194 this is a stage along a path to dismantling every part of our design they have skewed it toward a particularly big monolithic type of office it is bulking up and dumbing down the design
1020195 under our existing planning controls we expect there to be no space for jobs in the city within 12 years not a single square metre
1020196 we need to start a conversation now about the growth of the city
1020197 i understand its now at a shortlist of four consortia and there was three or four superlots
1020198 the process is yet to be completed but i understand consortiums can either bid for the whole thing or parts of it
1020199 if one developer is owning several blocks they can do what they like with the streets
1020200 they can move them put malls on them close them turn them into business parks the public interest in sydney is at risk of being stolen by private and commercial interests i dont have a problem with density but i do have a problem when its at the cost of the public domain we are the citizens we own the streets this will be thrown out the window for a 10 year fashion for big monolithic buildings
1020201 a lack of clarity in the planning process which has led to an erosion of the fundamental principles set out on the design competition
1020202 the release of the stage 1 development for barangaroo is located at the southern end of the site and accounts for 83 per cent of the developable area or total floor space

1020218 prob resultar clave en la victoria del oeste en la guerra fr a
1020219 implicaciones tecnol gicas y financieras para la urss fueron devastadoras
1020220 en los albores de 1983 los sovi ticos deben haber comenzado a darse cuenta de que su juego de manipulaci n e intimidaci n pronto se acabar a los gobiernos europeos no estaban dispuestos a caer en la trampa tendida por la propuesta de una zona libre de armas nucleares para europa continuaron los preparativos para el despliegue de los misiles crucero y pershing en el mes de marzo el presidente reagan anunci los planes de estados unidos para una iniciativa de defensa estrat gica ide cuyas consecuencias tecnol gicas y financieras para la urss ser an devastadoras
1020221 no me cab a la menor duda de lo correcto de su dedicaci n en insistir en el programa analizado retrospectivamente ahora me queda claro que la decisi n original de ronald reagan sobre la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica fue la m s importante de su presidencia
1020222 al formular nuestro enfoque a la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica hab a cuatro elementos diferentes que tuve en cuenta el primero fue la ciencia en s misma
1020223 el objetivo de estados unidos en la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica era desarrollar una defensa nueva y mucho m s eficaz contra los misiles bal sticos
1020224 este concepto de defensa se basaba en la capacidad de atacar a los misiles bal sticos lanzados en cualquier etapa de su vuelo desde la fase de impulsi n cuando el misil y todas sus ojivas y se uelos estaban juntos hasta el punto de reentrada en la atm sfera terrestre en su camino hacia el blanco
1020225 el segundo elemento que hab a que tener en cuenta eran los acuerdos internacionales existentes que limitaban el despliegue de armas en el espacio y los sistemas de proyectiles antibal sticos el tratado sobre la limitaci n de los sistemas de proyectiles antibal sticos de 1972 enmendado por un protocolo de 1974 permit a a estados unidos y a la uni n sovi tica emplazar un sistema de proyectiles antibal sticos est tico con hasta cien lanzacohetes para defender su campo de silos de misiles bal sticos intercontinentales
1020226 la oficina de relaciones exteriores y el ministerio de defensa brit nicos siempre procuraron insistir en la interpretaci n m s estrecha posible que los estadounidenses acertadamente a mi juicio creyeron que habr a significado que la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica hab a muerto al nacer
1020227 el tercer elemento en el c lculo fue la fuerza relativa de las dos partes en la defensa contra proyectiles bal sticos solo la uni n sovi tica pose a un sistema de proyectiles antibal sticos conocido como galosh en los alrededores de mosc que en esos momentos estaban perfeccionando los estadounidenses jam s hab an emplazado un sistema equivalente
1020228 los sovi ticos tambi n estaban m s avanzados en las armas antisat lites por consiguiente hab a un argumento fuerte de que los sovi ticos ya hab an adquirido una ventaja inaceptable en toda esta esfera
1020229 el cuarto elemento era lo que implicaba la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica para la disuasi n al principio sent bastante simpat a por la filosof a tras el tratado sobre la limitaci n de los sistemas de proyectiles antibal sticos que era que mientras m s ultramoderna y efectiva fuera la defensa contra los misiles nucleares mayor presi n hab a para procurar avances enormemente costosos en la tecnolog a para las armas nucleares siempre cre en una versi n con ligeras condiciones de la doctrina conocida como destrucci n rec proca segura mad por sus siglas en ingl s la amenaza de lo que yo prefiero llamar destrucci n inaceptable que se producir a tras un intercambio nuclear era tal que las armas nucleares constitu an un elemento de disuasi n efectivo contra la guerra no solo nuclear sino tambi n convencional
1020230 pronto comenc a ver que la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica no socavar a la disuasi n nuclear sino que la fortalecer a a diferencia del presidente reagan y de otros miembros de su administraci n jam s cre que la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica podr a ofrecer una protecci n al ciento por ciento pero permitir a que suficientes misiles de estados unidos sobrevivieran a un primer golpe de los sovi ticos
1020231 el tema de la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica fue el que domin mis conversaciones con el presidente reagan y con los miembros de su administraci n cuando fui a camp david el s bado 22 de diciembre de 1984 para informar a los estadounidenses sobre mis conversaciones previas con el se or gorbachov
1020232 esas observaciones me pusieron nerviosa me horrorizaba pensar que estados unidos estuvieran dispuestos a echar por la borda la ventaja tan arduamente ganada en materia de tecnolog a al ponerla a disposici n de todo el mundo
1020233 lo que escuch ahora que lleg bamos a la discusi n de las probabilidades reales m s que de una concepci n amplia era tranquilizador el presidente reagan no simulaba que ellos supieran a n a d nde pudieran conducir las investigaciones pero recalc que adem s de sus argumentos anteriores a favor de la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica seguirle el ritmo a estados unidos impondr a una presi n econ mica a la uni n sovi tica argument que no exist a un l mite pr ctico en cuanto hasta d nde el gobierno sovi tico podr a arrastrar a su pueblo por el camino de la austeridad
1020234 ahora yo anotaba mientras conversaba con el asesor para la seguridad nacional bud mcfarlane los cuatro puntos que me parec an m s cruciales
1020235 mis funcionarios luego insertar an los detalles el presidente y yo acordamos un texto donde se expon a la pol tica
1020236 le habl al presidente acerca de mi firme convicci n de que el programa de investigaciones de la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica deb a continuar
1020237 posteriormente supe que george schultz entonces secretario de estado pensaba que yo hab a asegurado una concesi n demasiado grande por parte de los americanos en la redacci n pero eso de hecho nos daba tanto a ellos como a nosotros una l nea clara y defendible y ayudaba a tranquilizar a los miembros europeos de la otan un d a de trabajo muy productivo
1020238 visit washington nuevamente en febrero de 1985 las negociaciones sobre armamentos entre los americanos y la uni n sovi tica ya se hab an reanudado pero la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica segu a siendo una fuente de discusi n yo deb a hablar ante una reuni n conjunta del congreso en la ma ana del mi rcoles 20 de febrero y llev conmigo desde londres como regalo una estatua de bronce de winston churchill a quien tambi n muchos a os antes se le hab a honrado con tal invitaci n trabaj de manera especialmente ardua en este discurso utilizar a el teleprompter para pronunciarlo sab a que el congreso hab a visto al propio gran comunicador pronunciando discursos intachables y yo tendr a un auditorio exigente de modo que decid practicar la lectura del texto hasta que lograra pronunciarlo con la entonaci n y el nfasis correctos hablar a partir del teleprompter debo agregar es una t cnica totalmente distinta a hablar a partir de notas de hecho el presidente reagan me prest su propio teleprompter y yo lo hab a llevado de vuelta a la embajada brit nica donde estaba alojada harvey thomas quien me acompa aba lo consigui y haciendo caso omiso de cualquier desfase horario practiqu hasta las 4 00 a m no me acost comenzando el nuevo d a de trabajo con mi acostumbrado caf negro y mis tabletas de vitaminas despu s conced entrevistas televisivas a partir de las 6 45 a m pas por la peluquera y estuve lista a las 10 30 para partir hacia el capitolio utilic mi discurso que abordaba extensamente los asuntos internacionales para dar un fuerte apoyo a la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica tuve una acogida fabulosa
1020239 el mes siguiente marzo de 1985 ocurri la muerte del se or chernenko y notablemente sin mucha demora la sucesi n del se or gorbachov a la direcci n de la uni n sovi tica
1020240 las relaciones de gran breta a con la uni n sovi tica entraron en un claro periodo de frialdad como resultado de las expulsiones que yo autoric de funcionarios sovi ticos que hab an estado realizando actos de espionaje
1020241 en noviembre el presidente reagan y el se or gorbachov celebraron su primera reuni n en ginebra
1020242 durante 1986 el se or gorbachov demostr gran sutileza en explotar la opini n p blica occidental al presentar propuestas tentadoras pero inaceptables sobre el control de armamentos los sovi ticos dijeron relativamente poco sobre el v nculo entre la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica y la reducci n de las armas nucleares pero no se les dio raz n alguna para creer que los americanos estaban dispuestos a suspender o detener las investigaciones relativas a la iniciativa de defensa estrat gica a finales de ese a o se acord que el presidente reagan y el se or gorbachov con sus ministros de relaciones exteriores se deber an reunir en reykjavik islandia para discutir ofertas sustantivas
1020243 el hecho era que nosotros no pod amos contener la investigaci n sobre nuevos tipos de armas ten amos que ser los primeros en obtenerlas es imposible detener a la ciencia no se detendr por ser ignorada
1020244 en retrospectiva puede considerarse que la cumbre de reykjavik ese fin de semana del 11 y 12 de octubre de 1986 tuvo una significaci n absolutamente diferente a la que le atribuy la mayor a de los comentaristas en ese entonces
1020245 pero entonces repentinamente al mism simo final se accion la trampa el presidente reagan hab a concedido que durante el periodo de diez a os ambos bandos acordar an no retirarse del tratado sobre la limitaci n de los sistemas de proyectiles antibal sticos aunque se permitir a el desarrollo y los ensayos compatibles con el tratado
1020246 el hotel es una maravillosa obra de ingenier a hecha totalmente de troncos la mayor caba a de troncos del mundo
1020247 tuve un mano a mano con el canciller schmidt jefe del gobierno alem n estaba realmente deprimido y de un humor pesimista acerca del mundo
1020248 luego me reun con el presidente mitterrand le expliqu nuestro programa econ mico y que no ten amos nada que ver con las altas tasas de inter s
1020249 esa noche cenamos solamente nosotros 8 los 7 jefes de estado y el presidente de la comunidad europea se convirti realmente en una conversaci n informal sobre cuestiones econ micas debido b sicamente a una sugerencia de la primera ministra thatcher
1020250 la guerra fr a fue una lucha a favor de la mism sima alma de la humanidad
1020251 este conflicto entre las superpotencias que sobrevivieron a la segunda guerra mundial comenz cuando yo regresaba a casa de la guerra
1020252 yo tuve el privilegio de ser el presidente de estados unidos cuando todo esto lleg a su fin

1020259 n s os comunistas temos que continuar arando com os capitalistas durante algum tempo necessitamos seus cr ditos sua agricultura e sua tecnologia contudo vamos continuar grandes programas militares e para meados dos 80 estaremos em condi o de voltar a uma pol tica exterior agressiva desenhada a ter vantagem sobre o oeste
1020260 com o decurso do tempo o com rcio e os investimentos pudessem reduzir a tend ncia do sistema sovi tico autarquia
1020261 convidar gradual associa o da economia sovi tica com a economia mundial e dessa maneira fomentar a interdepend ncia que acrescenta um elemento de estabilidade rela o pol tica
1020262 o resultado foi a mais colossal explos o n o nuclear e inc ndio jamais vistos desde o espa o na casa branca funcion rios e assessores receberam a advert ncia de sat lites infravermelhos dum estranho evento no meio dum lugar despovoado do territ rio sovi tico o norad comando de defesa aeroespacial norte americano temia que fosse o lan amento de m sseis desde um lugar onde n o se conhecia que houvessem m sseis instalados ou talvez fosse a detona o dum dispositivo nuclear os sat lites n o tinham detectado nenhuma pulsa o eletromagn tica caracter stica das detona es nucleares antes de que tais ind cios pudessem se converter numa crise internacional gus weiss chegou atrav s de um corredor para dizer a seus colegas do csn conselho de seguran a nacional que n o se preocuparam com isso afirma thomas reed em seu livro
1020263 em 1985 o caso teve um giro singular quando foi divulgada a informa o sobre o dossi farewell na fran a mitterrand chegou a suspeitar que o agente sovi tico fosse uma montagem da cia para p lo prova e decidir se o material seria entregue aos estadunidenses ou continuaria com os franceses atuando a partir dessa id ia mitterrand dispensou o chefe do servi o franc s yves bonnet
1020264 as circunstancias que rodearam sua morte ainda n o podiam ser confirmadas
1020265 o dossi de despedida o engano estrat gico e a guerra econ mica na guerra fria
1020266 provou ser a chave na vit ria do oeste na guerra fria
1020267 implica es tecnol gicas e financeiras para a urss foram devastadoras
1020268 nos alvores de 1983 os sovi ticos come aram a dar se conta de que seu jogo de manipula o e intimida o acabaria em breve os governos europeus n o estavam em disposi o de cair na armadilha colocada pela proposta de uma zona livre de armas nucleares para a europa continuaram os preparativos para o desdobramento dos m sseis cruzeiro e pershing no m s de mar o o presidente reagan anunciou os planos dos estados unidos para uma iniciativa de defesa estrat gica ide cujas conseq ncias tecnol gicas e financeiras para a urss seriam devastadoras
1020269 n o tinha a menor d vida do correto de sua dedica o em insistir no programa fazendo uma an lise retrospectiva agora para mim fica claro que a decis o original de ronald reagan a respeito da iniciativa de defesa estrat gica foi a mais importante de sua presid ncia
1020270 ao formular nosso enfoque iniciativa de defesa estrat gica havia quatro elementos diferentes que tive em conta o primeiro foi a ci ncia em si pr pria
1020271 o objetivo dos estados unidos na iniciativa de defesa estrat gica era desenvolver uma defesa nova e ainda mais eficaz contra os m sseis bal sticos
1020272 este conceito de defesa baseava se na capacidade de atacar os m sseis bal sticos lan ados em qualquer etapa de seu v o desde a fase de impuls o quando o m ssil e todas suas ogivas e iscas estavam juntos at o ponto de reentrada na atmosfera terrestre em seu caminho ao alvo
1020273 o segundo elemento que se deveria ter em conta eram os acordos internacionais existentes que limitavam o desdobramento de armas no espa o e os sistemas de proj teis antibal sticos o tratado sobre limita o dos sistemas de proj teis antibal sticos de 1972 emendado por um protocolo de 1974 permitia os estados unidos e a uni o sovi tica estabelecer um sistema de proj teis antibal sticos est tico com at cem lan a m sseis para defender seu campo de silos de m sseis bal sticos intercontinentais
1020274 o escrit rio de rela es exteriores e o minist rio de defesa brit nicos sempre tentaram insistir na interpreta o mais estreita poss vel que os estadunidenses acertadamente segundo a minha opini o creram que teria significado que a iniciativa de defesa estrat gica tinha morrido ao nascer
1020275 o terceiro elemento no c lculo foi a for a relativa das duas partes na defesa contra proj teis bal sticos s a uni o sovi tica possu a um sistema de proj teis antibal sticos conhecido como galosh nas cercanias de moscou que nesses momentos estavam aperfei oando os estadunidenses jamais tinham instalado um sistema equivalente
1020276 os sovi ticos tamb m estavam mais avan ados nas armas anti sat lites por conseguinte havia um argumento forte de que os sovi ticos j tinham adquirido uma vantagem inaceit vel em toda esta esfera
1020277 o quarto elemento era o que implicava a iniciativa de defesa estrat gica para a dissuas o ao princ pio senti bastante simpatia pela filosofia ap s o tratado sobre a limita o dos sistemas de proj teis antibal siticos que era que enquanto mais ultramoderna e efetiva fosse a defesa contra os m sseis nucleares major press o havia para procurar avan os enormemente custosos na tecnologia para as armas nucleares sempre acreditei numa vers o com ligeiras condi es da doutrina conhecida como destrui o rec proca segura mad por suas siglas em ingl s a amea a daquilo que eu prefiro chamar destrui o inaceit vel que se produziria ap s um interc mbio nuclear era tal que as armas nucleares constitu am um elemento de dissuas o efetivo contra a guerra n o s nuclear mas tamb m convencional
1020278 reparei rapidamente em que a iniciativa de defesa estrat gica n o socavaria a dissuas o nuclear mas sim a fortaleceria contr rio ao presidente reagan e a outros membros de sua administra o jamais acreditei que a iniciativa de defesa estrat gica poderia oferecer uma prote o cem por cento mas permitiria que suficientes m sseis dos estados unidos sobrevivessem a um primeiro golpe dos sovi ticos
1020279 o tema da iniciativa de defesa estrat gica foi o que dominou minhas conversas com o presidente reagan e com os membros de sua administra o quando fui a camp david o s bado 22 de dezembro de 1984 para informar aos estadunidenses sobre as minhas conversas pr vias com o senhor gorbachov
1020280 essas observa es fizeram com que eu ficasse nervosa horrorizava me pensar que os estados unidos estivessem dispostos a desfazer se inconsideradamente da vantagem t o arduamente ganhada no que se refere tecnologia ao p la a disposi o de todo o mundo
1020281 o que escutei agora que cheg vamos discuss o das probabilidades reais mais do que uma concep o ampla era tranq ilizador o presidente reagan n o simulava que eles ainda soubessem para onde poderiam conduzir as investiga es mas salientou que al m de seus argumentos anteriores em favor da iniciativa de defesa estrat gica seguir o ritmo aos estados unidos imporia uma press o econ mica uni o sovi tica argumentou que n o existia um limite pr tico sobre at onde o governo sovi tico poderia arrastar a seu povo pelo caminho da austeridade
1020282 agora eu anotava enquanto conversava com o assessor para a seguran a nacional bud mcfarlane os quatro pontos que eu achava os mais cruciais
1020283 meus funcion rios depois introduziriam os detalhes o presidente e eu acordamos um texto onde se expunha a pol tica
1020284 falei ao presidente acerca de minha firme convic o de que o programa de investiga es da iniciativa de defesa estrat gica devia continuar
1020285 depois eu soube que george schultz ent o secret rio de estado pensava que eu tinha garantido uma concess o exageradamente grande por parte dos americanos na reda o mas isso de fato dava nos tanto a eles quanto a n s uma linha clara e defend vel e ajudava a tranq ilizar os membros europeus da nato um dia de trabalho muito proveitoso
1020286 visitei washington novamente em fevereiro de 1985 as negocia es sobre armamentos entre os americanos e a uni o sovi tica tinham se reiniciado j mas a iniciativa de defesa estrat gica continuava a ser uma fonte de discuss o eu devia falar perante uma reuni o conjunta do congresso durante a manh da quarta feira 20 de fevereiro e levei comigo desde londres como presente uma estatua de bronze de winston churchill quem muitos anos antes foi honrado com esse convite trabalhei de maneira especialmente rdua neste discurso utilizaria o teleprompter para profer lo sabia que o congresso tinha visto o pr prio grande comunicador proferindo discursos perfeitos e eu teria um audit rio exigente de maneira que decidi praticar a leitura do texto at conseguir proferi lo com a entona o e a nfase corretas falar a partir do teleprompter devo acrescentar uma t cnica totalmente diferente a falar a partir de notas de fato o presidente reagan me emprestou o seu pr prio teleprompter e eu o levei de volta embaixada brit nica onde eu estava alojada harvey thomas quem me acompanhava o conseguiu e sem levar em conta qualquer diferen a hor ria pratiquei at as 4h 00 da manh n o me deitei come ando o novo dia de trabalho com o meu acostumado caf preto e as minhas p lulas de vitaminas depois concedi entrevistas televisivas a partir das 6h 45 da manh passei pelo cabeleireiro e estive pronta s 10h 30 para partir para o capit lio utilizei o meu discurso que abordava extensamente os assuntos internacionais para dar um forte apoio iniciativa de defesa estrat gica tive uma acolhida fabulosa
1020287 no m s subseq ente mar o de 1985 morreu o senhor chernenko e notavelmente sem muita demora a sucess o do senhor gorbachov na dire o da uni o sovi tica
1020288 as rela es da gr bretanha com a uni o sovi tica entraram num claro per odo de frialdade como resultado das expuls es que eu autorizei de funcion rios sovi ticos que realizaram atos de espionagem
1020289 em novembro o presidente reagan e o senhor gorbachov celebraram sua primeira reuni o em genebra
1020290 durante 1986 o senhor gorbachov demonstrou grande sutileza em explorar a opini o p blica ocidental ao apresentar propostas tentadoras mas inaceit veis sobre o controle de armamentos os sovi ticos falaram relativamente pouco sobre o v nculo entre a iniciativa de defesa estrat gica e a redu o das armas nucleares mas n o lhes foram dados motivos para considerar que os americanos estavam dispostos a suspender ou deter as investiga es referentes iniciativa de defesa estrat gica no fim desse ano acordou se que o presidente reagan e o senhor gorbachov com seus ministros das rela es exteriores dever se iam reunir em reykjavik isl ndia para discutir ofertas importantes
1020291 o fato era que n s n o pod amos deter a investiga o sobre novos tipos de armas t nhamos que ser os primeiros em obt las imposs vel deter a ci ncia n o se deter por ser ignorada
1020292 em retrospectiva pode se considerar que a c pula de reykjavik esse fim de semana nos dias 11 e 12 de outubro de 1986 teve uma grande significa o totalmente diferente que foi atribu da pela maioria dos comentaristas naquela altura
1020293 mas ent o de repente no mesm ssimo fim acionou se a armadilha o presidente reagan concedeu que durante o per odo de dez anos ambos os bandos acordariam n o se retirar do tratado sobre a limita o dos sistemas de proj teis antibal sticos embora se permitisse o desenvolvimento e os ensaios compat veis com o tratado
1020294 o hotel uma maravilhosa obra de engenharia feita totalmente de troncos a maior cabana de troncos do mundo
1020295 tive um cara a cara com o chanceler schmidt chefe do governo alem o na verdade estava deprimido e de um humor pessimista sobre o mundo
1020296 depois me reuni com o presidente mitterrand lhe expliquei o nosso programa econ mico e que n o t nhamos nada a ver com as altas taxas de juros
1020297 essa noite apenas jantamos n s 8 os 7 chefes de estado e o presidente da comunidade europ ia na verdade tornou se numa conversa informal sobre quest es econ micas devido fundamentalmente a uma sugest o da primeira ministra thatcher
1020298 a guerra fria foi uma luta em favor da mesm ssima alma da humanidade
1020299 este conflito entre as superpot ncias que sobreviveram segunda guerra mundial come ou quando eu regressava casa da guerra
1020300 eu tive o privil gio de ser o presidente dos estados unidos quando tudo isso acabou
1020301 teriam que transcorrer ainda dois anos para que acabasse o imp rio de lenine e stalin
1020302 duas semanas mais tarde uma segunda liga o telef nica confirmou que a antiga uni o sovi tica desapareceria mikhail gorbachov me contatou em camp david na manh de natal de 1991 desejou nos um feliz natal a b rbara e a mim e depois passou a resumir o que aconteceu em seu pa s a uni o sovi tica tinha deixado de existir ele acabava de comparecer na televis o nacional para confirmar o fato e transferiu o controle das armas nucleares sovi ticas ao presidente da r ssia podem desfrutar de uma tranq ila noite de natal disse nos e assim terminou tudo

1020306 ele disse que tinha jogado as partes do corpo neste ribeir o e como n o est vamos achando nada chegamos a imaginar que ele escondia mais detalhes sobre o caso agora sabemos que ele falou a verdade
1020307 o porteiro nos disse que n o havia uma segunda pessoa com ele santos no domingo em que desceu com a mala usada para transportar o tronco da v tima
1020308 ele ocultou a informa o de que usaria o carro para levar as partes do corpo apenas depois de desovar os quatro sacos pl sticos com os membros e jogar a mala com o tronco fora que decidiu contar o que tinha feito ao amigo
1020309 o que nos interessa agora o carro queremos saber como o corpo foi transportado para fora da cena do crime

1020324 over time many many successful companies have failed to take important risks at critical points and they have paid a price some have merely stumbled and found later redemption but quite a few have not only fallen but disappeared in the 1980s alone 230 companies disappeared from the fortune 500 in fact only 16 of the 100 largest companies that were around in the early 1900s are still with us
1020325 in business you can make a good argument for mistakes like steve jobs lisa or power maccube because the highly creative apple environment that spawned them also produced big winners like ipod and iphone
1020326 as peter drucker pointed out nearly fifty years agao it is managements major task to prudently risk a companys present assets in order to ensure its future existence in fact if a company never has a failure i submit that their management is probably not discontented enough to justify their salaries

1020328 in prisons the composition and polishing of verses had to be done in my head
1020329 stir fried kale they ate it all of it gone
1020330 it was a thrill to get 92 goals but in some ways i thought i let myself down by not getting 100
1020331 if he scored two he wanted three he always wanted more all stars have a love for the game what separates players like wayne is the passion hes like michael jordan they take it to the next level
1020332 charlie huddy took a shot from the left point that bounced off the boards and right to me at the corner of the net and i put it in
1020333 flyers forward bill barber said that if i were going in alone on an empty net for the 50th goal hed throw his stick giving him an automatic goal
1020334 that would have made a great trivia question how i scored my 50th goal without putting the puck into the net
1020335 five goals against the flyers in edmonton it was unbelievable with wayne you never knew what youd see i just liked sitting on the bench watching him
1020336 that was bittersweet for me that night i was at home in edmonton packing my apartment i had just been told i was heading to the minors i watched it on tv watching through my tears as gretz got 50 goals it was incredible to watch
1020337 i think gretz became the ultimate opportunist if you gave him something hed take it whether it was an opportunity to pass the puck or shoot the puck
1020338 around the 25th game actually game 24 against los angeles on nov 25 i had another four goal game that gave me 28 and its when i knew i could get 50 in 50 games that was the benchmark set by rocket richard and mike bossy
1020339 he started to recognize the fear that goaltenders had of him
1020340 not the same kind of fear that bobby hull generated this was more like whats he going to do with the puck and wayne didnt waste shots he had a deceivingly hard shot a good backhand and could shoot a change up
1020341 i played with a lot of great players glenn anderson messier paul coffey but to see that record of 92 goals was extraordinary wayne was dedicated focused and he played every night
1020342 its hard to fathom hard to believe a guy could come in and get that many goals in one year break every record we were young guys and we idolized guys like phil esposito gretz had a lot of respect for the eras before him thats why he was so special he was very humble even when he scored 92 goals thats why i have so much respect for wayne
1020343 werent we talking a few years ago about whether anyone was going to score 50 again and were surpassed that
1020344 i think theres a general consensus within the nhl community that offense is vital and we have to find ways to create more offensive opportunities and have more goals scored under those circumstances i think theres the possibility that someone might get the chances to score 92 whether they do or not is another question
1020345 ovechkin has the release and hands that bossy had hes got the quickness that jari kurri had and hes got the toughness that mark messier had hes the whole package he just loves to score
1020346 both teams that are here today are part of this record

1020361 i saw it firsthand i was here youth hockey took off and now you see kids born in 1990 1991 92 or 93 in l a are now going to come into the nhl draft because of what wayne did
1020362 i started teaching hockey to actors celebrities and just regular moms and dads who wanted to try this hockey thing
1020363 when you first start reading his stats its like youre looking at the harlem globetrotters
1020364 its hard to fathom that hes that much better than the second best guy in scoring you wonder how can this be true hes not physically imposing at all you watch him skate and hes not a fast skater nothing he does is remarkable except the score sheet at the end of the game
1020365 i can remember that was the first time i saw the little kings flags flying on the windows
1020366 it was a big deal each game from the semifinals on each game was like high drama it was a wonderful run the kings were on the front page of the sports sections they were the top of the sporting news people that had never watched the game started to watch it at that point there was a big buzz about the team at that point it was fun people that didnt know hockey were interested in hockey
1020367 for my kids and kids their age that was the first sporting event he watched and remembers
1020368 when i first started there must have been about 10 rinks but some of these rinks were lower basement type rinks that were probably a hardwood floor for roller hockey
1020369 westminster was just a supermarket they converted into a small rink it was mainly for figure skating and recreational skating
1020370 wheres your surfboard jokes like here come the beach boys
1020371 i cant believe these guys think they can skate but we turned the negative into positives we went to nationals and i remember hearing a parent say how good can those kids from california be
1020372 trading is not a great part of the job but then again there are a lot of things that arent very pleasant as a manager or coach but you just have to deal with it
1020373 it speaks to the loyalty that you should have as a coach to your players obviously when you trade somebody its an infringement of that loyalty so its never pleasant
1020374 very seldom can you make a trade of any magnitude let alone trading the best player in the league without the media knowing
1020375 as a coach or manager today we work really hard to be the first to notify a player of a trade before its announced on tsn the sports network its bizarre to me how the information gets out so quickly but i guess a lot of that can be attributed to the job the media does in terms of building relationships with the club managers
1020376 deals are always surprising when it involves other teams because youre not in the loop of whats going on day to day youre busy running your own team so in a sense any trade is a surprise
1020377 when i think back on edmonton owner peter pocklington and kings owner bruce mcnall and knowing those individuals as i did at the time i cant say it was a total shock
1020378 the key to that deal was obviously that a significant amount of money 15 million went to peter pocklington from bruce mcnall and mcnall had to arrange the financing of course the bank he used at the time was the same bank for the islanders so i was aware there were negotiations going on
1020379 the most important thing in a trade is to fortify what you already have on your team
1020380 i dont think the trading deadline is a time to reinvent your team by bringing in core pieces
1020381 i knew the trade was happening since at the time edmonton gm glen sather asked me what i wanted to do since we werent going to make the playoffs
1020382 i told him i wanted to compete in the playoffs because i was getting to the end of my career and wanted that opportunity
1020383 the best hockey player in the world was ours and the americans flew up from hollywood in their private jet and bought him
1020384 it wasnt the canadian heart that was torn it was the canadian psyche that was ripped by an uppercut to the paranoia
1020385 a couple of days after waynes wedding pocklington called me and said if youre serious about no
1020386 he said that jerry had originally offered him 15 million and any three players on the roster and we used that as a starting point for the negotiations i never did get him off that 15 million figure the money issue was settled the fastest
1020387 he didnt want to make the deal he told me that
1020388 its disappointing having to leave edmonton there comes a time when
1020389 has an ego the size of manhattan hes a great actor i thought he pulled it off beautifully when he showed how upset he was
1020390 i understood where he was coming from when he talked about the size of my ego
1020391 he didnt mean that as an insult but the part about the theatrics made me sick i wouldnt accept an apology on that
1020392 it was the only place i dreaded playing as an opponent
1020393 no this isnt rod serling but im beginning to feel like im in the twilight zone too
1020394 since we talked last week i just finished a trip to anaheim dallas nashville and tampa and even though i was in non hockey cities i couldnt get away from people asking the question thats on everyones mind is it true that wayne gretzky is going to be traded
1020395 it cant just be a rumor anymore not with this much speculation heck its got to be the biggest trade since babe ruth went from the red sox to the yankees eh
1020396 this beats all the other sports headlines by a mile
1020397 dont get me wrong the oilers will still win without the great one but there have been nights in his 10 years in edmonton when the rest of the team was having a bad night and he found a way to win anyway no one plays as smart and with the same kind of creativity in all of sports
1020398 in the end this trade may prove to be the best thing to happen to the nhl yeah i know it shakes up the hockey world especially in edmonton but if wayne can work his magic in los angeles there are a lot of other warm weather cities looking to get into the nhl think about how he could put hockey on the map in non hockey cities in the states
1020399 i thought slats then oilers general manager glen sather was joking when he asked me at the draft in late june if i wanted gretzky
1020400 i remember i asked him what he wanted my whole team
1020401 if there was an untouchable in this business it was gretzky from today on i guess anythings possible
1020402 i dont think theres an aug 9 thats gone by when i havent thought about it it still seems like yesterday and it was something i thought would never end
1020403 but we have to go on and look at this as a new challenge
1020404 if wayne totally wanted to say and if peter totally didnt want to trade him they would have found a way
1020405 i did go up to wayne and told him if you dont want to be traded ill stop it right now
1020406 i dont think theres an aug 9 thats gone by when i havent thought about it
1020407 it still seems like yesterday and it was something i thought would never end
1020408 i think about it all the time how things might have been different if i could have talked wayne out of the trade i think about it every time i see him i think about it every time i see or hear something about him
1020409 at the time we were the cream of the crop wed just won our fourth stanley cup and i played as well as i ever played in that final then all of a sudden that part of my life was over
1020410 if the team had been a separate entity if peter was not involved in the other businesses i think we could have kept that team together for quite a while longer
1020411 i think about it all the time how things might have been different if i could have talked wayne out of the trade i think about it every time i see him i think about it every time i see or hear something about him
1020412 i know we would have won more than one more stanley cup probably two or three
1020413 ill go to my grave believing we would have won seven or eight
1020414 ill never forget going back to edmonton that day i thought i was fine kings owner bruce mcnall kept asking me are you ok i thought i was composed then when a reporter asked me what my most memorable moment in edmonton was it hit me like a ton of bricks my tears came out from thinking about the people i had grown up with players i wouldnt play with anymore thinking of the stanley cups we had won the great times we had it all kind of hit me at once
1020415 he comes up in many conversations in how to play the role
1020416 there always needs to be somebody that the league can use to market itself and i cant remember the last time the league had as many great young players as it does right now
1020417 to say there will ever be another wayne i dont think so wayne set some pretty lofty standards not only on the ice but the way he conducted himself off the ice too
1020418 he had the biggest billboard in times square when he was still an edmonton oiler
1020419 he had already transcended his sport when he arrived in los angeles
1020420 when the trade was announced they cut into the daily soap shows to announce it it was real big news he was already established as an athlete who embodied all the things that a corporation would want in a spokesman he perpetually was at the top of his sport in performance he stayed healthy he carried himself away from the rink as an ambassador he didnt shy away from his responsibilities in that role he was approachable
1020421 we were ahead of the curve in that we convinced campbells to permit a small byline under his image www gretzky com to give awareness of the new web site we were creating
1020422 the number of impressions that came back far exceeded our capabilities to do anything with it in those early stages of the internet it was just really an information site then
1020423 he set the benchmark not only for hockey players but for high profile athletes
1020424 wayne gretzky was as high profile as anybody he had the look savvy the hollywood wife the whole thing gretzky was a pioneer
1020425 he was such an ambassador for the game people saw themselves in wayne he was either the son you wanted to have or the brother you wanted to have he just seemed so normal and approachable and sweet and yet he was otherworldly on the ice thats a rare rare combination
1020426 we would come back from a two week road trip east and one day later he slides back out to do a commercial to promote the game
1020427 it was an endless amount of energy that he put forward and he did it so easily and eloquently he really has set the model of what the players need to be
1020428 hes got the ability to be a superstar at such a young age and manage it so well its a gift a special chip you have it or you dont now to say that is he the next one well sidney crosby ten to 15 years from now people are going to look at the next kid and ask is this kid the next crosby sidney will pave his way in a different form than wayne but in my opinion he has so far been a unique athlete like wayne
1020429 to say there will ever be another wayne i dont think so wayne set some pretty lofty standards not only on the ice but the way he conducted himself off the ice too
1020430 when the blue chip opportunities were coming on a weekly basis for wayne he already accomplished the unfathomable
1020431 and thats winning nine hart trophies seven scoring championships consecutively and four stanley cups
1020432 there will only be one wayne gretzky but the internet has made alex ovechkin accessible everywhere
1020433 when he scored t he goal in his rookie year we had over a million hits of the goal on our web site and about 600 000 were from outside north america it was a global phenomenon if we had broadband internet when gretzky was playing he would have been the same way
1020434 lots of people didnt know about hockey but they knew this gretzky guy
1020435 it was an era when information was traveling slower but he still managed to be the name of the game
1020436 the more i watched butchie the more i saw what he brought to the table and the more i thought he would be an ideal fit
1020437 so we stepped up and he proved to be exactly what we thought he would be
1020438 i wondered if wayne would survive for three months because looking at the roster when i got the job i thought we were really going to struggle in 2007 08
1020439 generally the best players are the best because they are the fiercest competitors he has that burning desire to win so i wondered how wayne gretzky would accept the losing i thought we would be doing
1020440 for me as a guy trying to develop and build a franchise i couldnt think of anybody better suited to coach this team its a credit to his patience
1020441 i always knew wayne would be involved in hockey in some capacity its in him its what he loves and knows the best
1020442 as it turns out what he loves the best is being down in the action
1020443 he has tried it all from management to president in a lot of different areas including team canada but what he found is he really enjoys the interaction with the players and being in the heat of the game it doesnt surprise me that hes down there
1020444 our fans have put up with a lot and last year was an exciting year because we gave them a nice run and our young guys improved drastically
1020445 we feel we got even better at the entry draft and we should be able to compete for a playoff spot unfortunately there are 12 to 13 very good teams in the west and thats going to make it difficult
1020446 i have a great deal of respect for every coach i played for
1020447 thats what its all about but make sure you dont make the same mistakes over and over again
1020448 i am very patient especially with young guys im harder on my veteran players but they can handle it i feel as a coach if players see that the top guys can take construction criticism anybody can
1020449 we were a younger team so i knew my presence and how i react would filter through the locker room a lot more
1020450 older guys would brush it off but for the younger guys i felt it was important to show composure and a lot more patience
1020451 i am very patient especially with young guys im harder on my veteran players but they can handle it i feel as a coach if players see that the top guys can take construction criticism anybody can
1020452 hes willing to do what very few coaches in the nhl are willing to do and thats play young players at important times
1020453 there is such a win today mentality in coaching which turns into a survivor mentality among the coaches i can certainly understand that but wayne is not only the coach he is also the managing partner he understands that for us to win here he has to live with youthful mistakes for a little while
1020454 everybody says just because youre a great player youre not going to be a good coach i never bought that philosophy
1020455 often times the great players have a great appreciation of everybodys worth on the team and role nobody has displayed that better than wayne and if anything he can help all those young players in their roles
1020456 i was like wow wayne gretzky said my name thats pretty cool
1020457 typically what happens is the first day or two that is part of it
1020458 but after they get to see me and know me they realize im just another one of the guys in our group and they can brush that all off
1020459 it is kind of nerve wracking but at the same time you have to get used to it because its going to be like that all the time
1020460 you have to be confident in yourself not to worry too much that hes there
1020461 there are so many people pulling him in different areas yet he knows i need to be at the rink early to have my focus on the team and spend whatever time after practice to make this work
1020462 its not a part time and he has become good at it hes a brilliant man
1020463 we felt we got lucky eberle was a kid that when he left our draft meetings we sort of kept our fingers crossed that wed be able to get him we were lucky to get him we got players that we had a lot of interest in which is always good
1020464 we have a lot of skilled players on the team but not a lot of pure goal scorers
1020465 he sort of fits that bill we think down the road hes going to be a very good player for us
1020466 riley has a lot of potential to do a lot of things
1020467 i think at the end of this year well give some serious thought and seeing whether he wants to turn pro or not
1020468 he played in every situation hes been training really hard since the end of the season he knew his strength had to get better hes going to get every opportunity to make the team in september
1020469 we needed to get him some playing time and we went into stockton and made the all star team
1020470 we brought him to springfield for the end of the year and he played really well at our recent prospect camp he looked great his biggest strength is he does all the little things well
1020471 over the course of 80 games he was probably our best player and sort of came out of nowhere from that standpoint hes going to get a good opportunity to maybe win a job up here with the big team
1020472 he had a great year and had gotten better each year
1020473 at our recent prospect camp he was one of our top forwards when we drafted him he was 170 pounds and now hes 215 pounds hes going to play a big part at north dakota this year hell be one of their top line players were very high on him
1020474 it was like nothing could go right for the kid but he came back at the end of the year and played very well weve kept a close eye on him this summer and hes training very hard theres no after effects from his injury he knows as well as we do that this is a big year for him hes got a lot of making up to do this year he understands more so than anybody else what he has to do this year were expecting a good year out of him
1020475 he has that pro mentality he skates so well and does everything almost effortlessly we think it was time for him to come out of school and hell probably need a little time at springfield to adjust to the pro game but i dont think its going to be long before hes in the nhl
1020476 hes another one were going to keep a close eye on this year
1020477 hes got to get a little bit bigger but at our recent camp he was up around 190 pounds for a kid to step into michigan state and play on their first power play and first penalty kill is a tribute to the type of player this kids going to be
1020478 hes an old school type of defenseman in that hes a stay at home player
1020479 he doesnt carry the puck a whole lot but he moves it quickly defensively hes more than adequate hes very strong for his age
1020480 we had a lot of injuries down there and he had to assume a lot of extra ice time i think it really helped him hes been out in edmonton now for over a month training out here with click for larger photo
1020481 we expect him to play at least 60 games down there when he did play last year he played very well for us at 6 5 and 200 pounds that covers a lot of room hes got a great attitude and he knows what he has to do we fully expect hes going to do it
1020482 hes signed and hell be the no 1 goalie in stockton this year hes very athletic we signed him because of his athleticism hes just so quick and has all the basic ingredients to be a good goalie its just a point of getting the fundamentals down and him having confidence in his own game

1020631 there appears to be an effort by the federal government to coerce states into exempting their fusion centers from state open government laws
1020632 for those living in virginia its already too late the virginia general assembly passed a law in april 2008 exempting the states fusion center from the freedom of information act
1020633 the new snoops terrorism liaison officers some from the private sector
1020634 fusion centers and their leadership encourage appropriate policymakers to legislate the protection of private sector data provided to fusion centers
1020635 this intelligence community that was built to deal with foreign threats is now being slowly and incrementally turned inward
1020636 this kind of concentrated power exercised in secret is a lit fuse with our constitution likely in danger of being burned
1020637 if we are not discerning enough to recognize the availability of the fruits of the spirit to us to desire them and to nourish them in our thoughts they will never become embedded in our nature or behavior every further step of spiritual growth in gods grace must be preceded by acknowledging our lack of a godly attribute and then exhibiting a prayerful determination to obtain it

1020653 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments
1020654 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
1020655 when this occurred planes were flying everywhere and controllers had no means to get a hold of them
1020656 scolari said nothing to me when i was with portugal but this is significant as it means the work i have been doing at atletico is positive

1020659 though polak addresses designing for the other 90 percent in the book he focuses on those living in extreme poverty on less than 1 per day the bottom 10 percent entrepreneurs interested in developing products for those earning 2 5 per day may need to modify some of his design concepts trading off durability for affordability or avoiding microcredit may not be appropriate for entrepreneurs developing products for small businesses in urban markets for example envirofit customers who drive motorcycle taxis in asia prefer to purchase a more durable product and microcredit loans facilitate the purchase entrepreneurs would be wise to focus on designing the most affordable solution for their target customer taking into account manufacturing transportation and financing costs
1020660 god speaks to his servants in this umma and they are given the semblance of prophets and they are not really prophets for the quran has made perfect the needs of law and they are given only an understanding of the quran and they cannot add to or detract from it aught and whoever adds to or detracts from it he is of the devils who are wicked
1020661 the spread of islam by arms is a religious duty upon muslims in general
1020662 jihad the fighting against unbelievers with the object of either winning them over to islam or subduing and exterminating them in case they refuse to become muslims
1020663 their contention that since jihad was permitted in the early days of islam there is no reason why it should be prohibited now is entirely misconceived it may be refuted in two ways firstly that this inference is drawn from wrong premises and our holy prophet never used the sword against any people except those who first took up the sword against the muslims secondly that even if we suppose for the sake of argument that there was such a jihad in islam as these maulvis think even so that order does not stand now for it is written that when the promised messiah appears there will be an end of jihad with the sword and of religious wars
1020664 there is not the least doubt that the conditions laid down for jihad in the holy quran are not to be met with at the present time and in this country so it is illegal for the muslims to fight for the propagation of religion and to kill anyone who rejects the sacred law for god has made clear the illegality of jihad when there is peace and security
1020665 and fight in the way of god against those who fight against you and be not aggressive for god does not love the aggressors
1020666 before all i thank the government under which we can publicly and with the beat of drums teach the religious doctrines of our pure faith without any interference whatsoever and we can pay back our opponents whether they are christians or others in their own coin such religious liberty we cannot have even under the sultan of turkey
1020667 considering the divine law and the present condition of the muslims we have said that this is not the time of the sword
1020668 a perusal of historical books shows that the peace security and liberty which all people have received under this rule have never been obtained under any other rule
1020669 key among motives for the attack according to a member of the village assembly was that area muslims felt disturbed by the presence of the christian college
1020670 jones didnt get offered by nd but said they are very close to doing so
1020671 roh az de craig roh is going to be tough to pull from michigan he said they are his top school as of now
1020672 the key finding here is that this is ascorbic acid used as a drug and it appears to have some promise in treating some cancers
1020673 that hydrogen peroxide leads to death of some cancer cells and does not seem to kill normal cells why that is we dont know
1020674 the thing thats realistic here is that the concentrations that are effective or similar concentrations can be achieved in humans

1020678 so i was a total failure in trying to seduce amanda vanstone she was not terribly impressed he admitted
1020679 during the eighth round of negotiations held since 2002 it is almost about all or nothing kelsang gyaltsen told german news magazine
1020680 we will present a detailed plan of how we foresee autonomy in tibet if the chinese side reacts positively one could propose specific preliminary steps for example a pilgrimage of the dalai lama to china
1020681 such a development could lead to a meeting between his holiness and the chinese president and provide decisive momentum
1020682 we are hearing that leading chinese military officers are calling for a detente on the tibet question he said
1020683 when deadline couriers gives you a time they actually mean it
1020684 hes with us and well use him we know how good he is
1020685 samuel is one of the best players in the world
1020686 i dont know whats going on with the club because thats not my business but samuel is really important to us and always wants to win
1020687 samuel has always had his place at barca and hes working flat out which you have to respect
1020688 weve done a really good job as chivas are one of the best sides in mexico
1020689 we scored a lot of goals and defensively weve worked hard which is absolutely essential
1020690 the feeling you get is that no matter who plays the team is working well and that gives you peace of mind at the start of the season
1020691 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1020692 its not just a new face we need its new faces
1020693 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
1020694 its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc
1020695 im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season
1020696 ill have some time to recover from this race and the first half of the season
1020697 weve no commitments outside of the racing world so we can just focus on our training our fitness to make sure we are ready for the second half of the season
1020698 theres still a long way to go so im going to make sure i work very hard and that physically i am well prepared
1020699 i want to make sure we keep up with the performance we have
1020700 but he has definitely set himself up for a more intense training programme for the next three weeks
1020701 when a driver is doing well all he wants to do is get in the car and race
1020702 thats understandable but hed be the first to recognise this break is absolutely essential for the team mechanics and all the people who travel
1020703 they dont get the right amount of time with their families and this gives them an opportunity to have at least one week where they are not at the office or workshops
1020704 its a key ingredient of keeping people motivated and happy when you are addressing the calendar which makes next years difficult for them
1020705 we will have to accommodate that by rotating people they will not be expected to go right through the season
1020706 lewis will have his wish next year hell be racing every other week at least
1020707 heikki is going to benefit from knowing he has a secure position next year
1020708 it was the right time to tell him to show him we have belief in his abilities because clearly he is super quick no question about that
1020709 he is still not quite where we want him to be
1020710 but we knew it would take time because that was the assessment aki hintsa head of human performance made at the start of the season
1020711 but when he gets into full physical condition then hes going to be an outstanding driver
1020712 heikki has a long way to go in his career
1020713 we were prepared to welcome proposals for a long term relationship with a new substantial investor to help establish west brom as a successful premier league club
1020714 we said we would shut the door on this at the end of july because we did not want anything off the pitch impacting on the new season
1020715 there has been some initial contact from a few third parties but we have received no firm proposals whatsoever
1020716 we proactively invited a new investor with substantial resources to contact the club
1020717 although no one has come forward the club have been planning more ambitiously and aggressively than ever before for the new season and we are very much looking forward to once again competing in the premier league
1020718 it is a nonsense for anyone to suggest a transfer cannot be processed simply because i am not in attendance
1020719 i was away from the office for a few hours on wednesday afternoon but i was available by phone and there were two directors present who could have completed the deal if it had been possible to do so

1020812 ranieri i guess hes right with what he said i am very demanding of myself and i have to win to be sure of things
1020813 this is why i have won so many trophies in my career ranieri on the other hand has the mentality of someone who doesnt need to win he is almost 70 years old
1020814 he has won a supercup and another small trophy and he is too old to change his mentality
1020815 seeing ibrahimovic in training makes me understand how special he is

1020819 knowledge based innovations differ from all others in the time they take in their casualty rates and in their predictability as well as in the challenges they pose to entrepreneurs like most superstars they can be temperamental capricious and hard to direct they have for instance the longest lead time of all innovations
1020820 effective innovations start small they are not grandiose in innovation as in any other endeavor there is talent there is ingenuity and there is knowledge but when all is said and done what innovation requires is hard focused purposeful work
1020821 john joyce 73 years old will start the first part of the via francigena from canterbury tomorrow john walked from valorbe to rome last year and will do the first part as far as lausanne then he will walk to geneva and on to le puy where he will follow the camino to irun from there he will walk the camino norte to santiago john has walked the camino france and the via de la plata the amazing thing is that he had a heart attack a few months ago and thought that he would never be able to do a long distance walk again if anyone out there sees him the road please dont offer him a lift he wont accept offer him a beer instead

1020827 cites research by two groups of researchers as well as the opinions of jeffrey sachs and arata kochi head of the whos global malaria program which suggest that getting the poor to pay for bed nets condoms or deworming meds
1020828 in public health many aid groups have embraced a strategy of stimulating demand for goods such as condoms anti malaria bed nets and water purification systems through education and advertising and then selling them at very low prices through health clinics kiosks and itinerant vendors
1020829 there was no evidence that women who got free nets were any less likely to use them
1020830 10 percent of malaria nets currently deployed there were bought in traditional stores 41 percent were provided through clinics via social marketing and 44 percent were handed out during the mass distribution of 2006 largely financed by the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria
1020831 clearly the time has come to see differing strategies as complementary rather than as competing alternatives
1020832 weve been quite pleased with the relationship with guardianedge obviously as the pipeline continues to build that represents a good opportunity for both of our companies
1020833 weve made no decisions about changing that relationship or any other as it might add to purchase something in the encryption space
1020834 no workers should be subjected to any threat no matter what job they undertake
1020835 the traffic wardens do perform a very important function and i think most people in the public in northern ireland recognise that they contribute to road safety and they have a job to do
1020836 our work is solely focused on traffic management and keeping traffic flowing in busy areas having no parking enforcement will only have a negative impact in the area
1020837 we believe that your consideration should be based on a single department in which policing and justice powers would reside with a single minister elected at all times from the assembly in a way which would ensure cross community support
1020838 we have agreed that initially neither of our parties will nominate one of our members for the post of justice minister
1020839 within this broad framework there are still a considerable number of issues to be determined we would be grateful if your committee would consider producing a report within this framework
1020840 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
1020841 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species
1020842 they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
1020843 elephants are also a major part of ecotourism which is an important source of hard currency for many african countries recent reports have shown that demand for ivory is growing in places such as china japan and the us
1020844 public support stopped the illegal ivory trade back in 1989 and can do so again
1020845 the work with dna sampling allows us to focus law enforcement on poaching hotspots
1020846 it forces countries to take more responsibility for what goes on within their borders and it also gives us more insight on where to look so that hopefully we can stop the poachers before the elephants are actually killed

1020848 the main achievement is that russia has revived its influence in the world
1020849 but morally we are too far from what is needed this cannot be achieved by the state through parliamentarianism as far as the state the public mind and the economy is concerned russia is still far away from the country of which i dreamed

1020851 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
1020852 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
1020853 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
1020854 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops
1020855 what am i going to do i have 30 homeless children
1020856 she said people have unplanned pregnancies all the time laurie youre just having an unplanned adoption
1020857 but when you look at them how can you say theyre unadoptable

1020859 its going to be very difficult for them to go home theyve already become so attached

1020863 but the neighbors in those two neighborhoods wanted two crossings and wanted those crossings lined up with the access points that come down from their neighborhoods
1020864 in some of these locations they seem to be permeating the entire neighborhoods which is unnecessary

1020871 the doug kanoy fund really sets a great model for others to follow
1020872 we hope that other donors step forward to add support to the philanthropic vision of mr leopold and mr evans so that the fund will increase in years to come allowing for greater participation
1020873 ever since i was a little girl i loved art i loved to color in books and draw pictures being creative was an important part of who i was and it is even more so today i started scrapbooking a month before my first child was born 7 years ago and i love it more each day i love that i get to create with paper and embellishments that i love i love that i get to play with photos of my children that mean something special to me i love that i get to write my thoughts down stories events funny things the kids say i love that i get to be creative i think i do it more for that creative release than anything right now its a break from changing diapers preparing food cleaning the house its something that i can escape to and have fun putting things together and creating my own pieces of artwork i love scrapbooking i hope that i always have the same passion for it as i do today
1020874 its an election year which is basically christmas for stand up comics

1020876 t he fed is likely to continue signalling that it would ideally like to raise rates however given the uncertainty on growth we doubt that they will be hiking rates anytime soon the most likely outcome of all this is that the philadelphia feds charles plosser joins dallas fed president richard fisher in voting for a rate hike tomorrow
1020877 the year over year inflation rate has trended higher since bottoming at 1 9 in august 07 and is now near the cyclical highs for this data series since 1993
1020878 t he ending of the tax rebates rising job losses ongoing house price declines and continued impairment of financial intermediation suggest a weakening consumer in coming months
1020879 the inflation data is clearly worrisome and the historical tendency for inflation to rise during the early months of a growth slowdown make it no less so

1020889 oh crap i should not have drunk that much of loris punch
1020890 we thought the stuff would be legal by now and look at it people getting busted for it and seeing time like they did in the 1950s that utopia we dreamed about and threw rocks at the cops for sure took a nosedive instead we have a brave new world drug scene where doctors pass out pills whose sole role is to homogenize our emotions and our essential beings
1020891 look at the political spectrum from authoritarian neoliberalism to authoritarian neoconservatism
1020892 constantly choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil
1020893 we dont think it makes sense to plan for a mass march that might not end up being all that mass
1020894 it would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing we made no deal
1020895 differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole
1020896 the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy
1020897 i suppose now mark youre gonna lecture us about rigged voting hey little dolt
1020898 im not talking about that im referring to all the executive orders and legislation your heroes in the white house have put in place that make it a cinch if they so choose to declare martial law lock up dissenters and thus dispense with even faux balloting
1020899 theres an obvious problem with your hallucination theres nowhere to house thousands of traitors
1020900 in january 2006 halliburtons then subsidiary kbr was handed a 385 million government contract to per a crowing press release build temporary detention and processing facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the u
1020901 thatll make those terrorists think twice about rushing the border
1020902 you mean the hordes of canadians breathlessly poised to overrun america with their deadly hockey sticks
1020903 forget the emergency influx of immigrants ruse whats this rapid development of new programs the swift incarceration of thousands of americans protesting the imposition of martial law perhaps
1020904 i wish i were imagining things unfortunately horrors like domestic detention facilities are but one verifiable piece of an all encompassing all intrusive system bushco has methodically installed to take unchallenged control of america instantly
1020905 hes not bad i guess you know for an iraqi i even loaned him five bucks the other day
1020906 then youd better hope his views of what the bushies are doing to his country are in line with theirs
1020907 thats your concern ahmeds suddenly suspect appearance rather than an insanely vague executive order
1020908 your anti americanism mark blinds you to seeing that anyone could be a terrorist you just never know and unfortunately theres no machine that can look into peoples hearts
1020909 in june the transportation security administration installed body scanner devices in ten major u s airports that produce essentially naked photographs of travelers
1020910 maybe i should call and apply as a scanner operator heh heh
1020911 knock yourself out just pray tsa hasnt out sourced its call center to say india because under the new fisa bill any message you send to or receive from overseas is fair game for the government warrant or probable cause be damned ill bet apolitica would love to hear that tape played in court
1020912 if the pending violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism prevention act becomes law banish that thought from your mind as well as many others
1020913 this bill is thought crime codified establishing a national commission to provide legislative recommendations for stopping those peskily ubiquitous homegrown terrorists from among other things developing and spreading within the united states the use planned use or threatened use of force or violence by a group or individual to promote the group or individuals political religious or social beliefs
1020914 not much i guess other than its so broadly and absurdly written that anyone at a demonstration for example could be deemed a terrorist
1020915 like all those ones youve attended i think ill call my senator tomorrow to push that bill unlike certain america haters i know i believe in doing everything possible to defeat evildoers
1020916 why wait why not instead ask your boss if hes one of the 23 000 fbi deputized private industry members of infragard who according to matthew rothschild of the progressive preferentially receive secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does if so then maybe you too could attend infragard meetings like that at which one participant reported he and others were told by homeland security and the fbi that when not if martial law is declared it was our responsibility to protect our portion of the infrastructure and if we had to use deadly force to protect it we couldnt be prosecuted does that not get your attention
1020917 absolutely it sounds like an even better gig than eyeballing nudie shots of airline passengers uh i mean performing confidential inspections in the name of national security ok you two lets go
1020918 sorry to ruin your day but i gotta help my boss install a new grill over at the sloppy burger
1020919 hey dolt do you think after you two hook that thing up youll eventually end up cooking burgers on it
1020920 of course why would anyone go to all the trouble to put something in place and then not use it
1020921 having an internationally documented standard such as office open xml allows innovative new zealand companies such as intergen to reach a global audience
1020922 textglow is a unique product combining office open xml and silverlight for the first time
1020923 microsoft office documents have traditionally required software to be installed on the local machine the new xml based file format coupled with silverlight has allowed us to make documents viewable directly through users web browsers we are already cross platform on windows and macintosh and hope to be supporting linux in the next couple of months
1020924 the colombian government has steadily been opening the colombian economy more and more to u s corporations ever since 1985 the free trade agreement between colombia and the u s is the marriage after a long courtship
1020925 if you were to map out the paramilitary activity in colombia and then superimpose a map of the countrys natural resources they would coincide completely
1020926 in argentina people dont necessarily support the left but they view the left with a certain degree of sympathy because they see them as people who sacrifice themselves for the oppressed
1020927 it was far safer to be in a union than to be an ordinary citizen in colombia last year
1020928 of the 87 convictions won in union cases since 2001 the judges found that 15 of the murders were related to common crime 10 to crimes of passion and 13 to membership in a guerrilla organization
1020929 there will always be winners and losers the best we can do for the losers is to mitigate their losses
1020930 for example in terms of veterinary vaccinations say that were functioning at 99 safety in other words laboratories are working with extremely high safety standards but instead of 99 they impose 99 9 of course were talking about arbitrary figures but the increase in technology is going to rob part of the profits they are making so you see how technical standards can also become a factor for imposing the price of multinationals and monopolies
1020931 colombia is an example of how the resistance against neoliberalism can be paralyzed by massive violations of human rights through persecuting social movement leaders to permit this model of violence and impunity as has occurred with the negotiation by the colombian government with the paramilitaries is a new model of impunity if we allow this model to be imposed in all of latin america it will constitute an essential element for imposing the ftaa in all of latin america

1020939 auch dann wenn es zu einer partnersuche kommt muss sterreich durch dieses konsortium vertreten bleiben das hat einen ganz einfachen grund ich glaube dass die aua f r den standort sterreich eine so wichtige bedeutung hat das f r viele betriebe und somit f r viele arbeitspl tze diese gestaltbarkeit durch sterreichische unternehmen und den bund in dieser sperrminorit t erhalten bleiben muss ich sehe das als nicht verhandelbar

1020950 this political theater for that is all it was exacted a price it diverted the nation from the intellectually rigorous debate over energy policy it needs to have and should have in an election year
1020951 the oil markets main focus right now is on any weakness that signals a slowdown in the economy and this personal spending report is further evidence of that
1020952 i dont think that the fed can really pull any of its levers to create a short term fix

1020960 were being clouded out by leadership issues rather than real issues and really at this time the labor government should frankly be on the nose
1020961 i find them quite incompetent and they sought of articulate a lot and do nothing and they even seem confused about what theyre doing
1020962 in the meantime were stuck in this leadership thing which is very sad
1020963 people generally expect politicians to stand up and have the courage and fight for what they want and take it
1020964 were not getting enough focus now on those huge issues right now because i have to say the media seems more interested in what happens in party rooms

1020970 con quasi tutti i 60 paesi dellocse uno dei pochissimi per cui mancava questo trattato bilaterale era proprio lislanda ha spiegato il deputato in realt la convenzione era stata firmata nel 2002 e litalia stata un pochino lenta nel portare a ratifica questo trattato che avvenuto solo oggi
1020971 i detenuti italiani allestero per una serie di motivi finiscono per essere detenuti penalizzati rispetto sia a chi si trova a vivere le stesse situazioni in italia ma a volte anche rispetto ad altri detenuti delle carceri di quei paesi dove loro sono trattenuti spesso anche con situazioni ai limiti del rispetto dei diritti umani

1020973 far from emerging from a legitimate democratic process where the public interest is identified and articulated
1020974 the project is the product of a developers dream and a conscious effort to bypass city procedures mandating meaningful local review planning democratic oversight and community input
1020975 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution this case presents an opportunity to continue that tradition by declaring that the new york constitution prohibits the government from seizing private homes simply to turn them over to a developer who covets them for a massive luxury condominium project
1020976 we are confident that the court will see this for what it is government officials bending to the will of bruce ratner allowing him to wield the power of eminent domain for his personal financial benefit

1021004 when a microwave enters a supercluster it gains some gravitational energy and therefore vibrates slightly faster later as it leaves the supercluster it should lose exactly the same amount of energy but if dark energy causes the universe to stretch out at a faster rate the supercluster flattens out in the half billion years it takes the microwave to cross it thus the wave gets to keep some of the energy it gained as it entered the supercluster
1021005 the problem with dark energy is that i have never seen any proposal to recreate and or test for in in a laboratory all of the other forms of energy can be created and tested for in a laboratory
1021006 detection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
1021007 the fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated and at a slanted viewing path through titans atmosphere raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument
1021008 it was hard for us to accept the fact that the feature was so black when we first saw it more than 99 9 percent of the light that reaches the lake never gets out again for it to be that dark the surface has to be extremely quiescent mirror smooth no naturally produced solid could be that smooth

1021011 i was shocked and relieved at the number of calls we had
1021012 i had said to the kids we would have to cancel and they were so disappointed so when we got that response it was unbelievable
1021013 the people that we got were just the type of people we wanted and shared the ethos of the group which has always been to work together and respect each other
1021014 karen and i are delighted at the energy and innovative way the charity has in getting out the important message to children on wearing helmets
1021015 as a racing driver i am only too aware of the need for helmets and the protection value that they offer and therefore we are delighted that we have been able to contribute to the charity to help them run this great scheme
1021016 the charity has been overwhelmed by the support of police forces throughout the uk
1021017 their support along with an estimated 12 000 reward packs being distributed for the start of helmet watch and a further estimated 25 000 packs being rewarded in the next four months will make this a fantastic campaign to help increase helmet use
1021018 children and young people risk these effects daily by not wearing a helmet when cycling for a variety of reasons they fear pressure from their peers and also need to conform to a designer image that does not portray helmets as being cool
1021019 helmet watch aims to help them justify their helmet use to their peers and will help to reiterate the message given by thousands of parents daily as they attempt to get their child to wear a helmet

1021032 the focus within qantas for the past five years has been more about how to reduce costs rather than how to improve quality and as a consequence these problems will pop up more regularly
1021033 in terms of maintenance qantas has cut back to the bare minimum and casa just sat back and let this happen
1021034 there needs to be an independent body to investigate the recent incidents and to investigate the special relationship between qantas and casa
1021035 this study highlights several key economic benefits of home ownership for indigenous australians including increased income strong employment improved financial and budgeting skills and maintenance of their property
1021036 there is no doubt that equity in a home leads to a strong stake in your economic future i want more indigenous working families to have this sense of security and control over their future through home ownership
1021037 and for indigenous people land is so important obviously many of us dont have places that we can call our own thats our own country so to be able to purchase a home and to have a piece of land thats your very own it gives you a sense of belonging and identity
1021038 significant potential to shift the dominant paradigm and reduce intractable problems with maintenance and short housing life cycles
1021039 it appeared as if the occupants had just stepped out and would be back shortly it was described as eerie
1021040 came back and said there was an empty bottle of spirits on the floor he said it looks as if thered been a scuffle
1021041 but when you look at the video there is no bottle of spirits they ask him if he looked at the fridge and he said he didnt want anyone lunging at him with a knife i would like to know if there were any knives on the floor
1021042 because structural policies are domestic in nature they are sometimes not well suited for negotiation between economies
1021043 we recognise the differences as well as similarities between our economies in an open manner
1021044 i think he is still considering his position yes i do
1021045 the cartoonists who presented him as a hamlet like figure were at least right for a period he may have decided on this recent holiday i havent spoken to him since he returned it may well be that was a period of finally getting things together
1021046 yes that was certainly his mood on november 25th i cant point to a date that he changed his mind i think melbourne university press publisher louise adler had something to contribute to that because she persuaded him to write the book
1021047 and that gave him the opportunity to really do more than brood but to actually settle down and sort out his ideas so the book is a sorting out of ideas
1021048 look let me put it this way there are two views one is that i did these 12 years and thats an important episode of my life and now its time to move on that makes perfect sense rather than revisit the old battlegrounds the other view is that i still have so much more to contribute that i really ought to do it
1021049 theres a touch of that and theres touch of plain narrative a touch of apologia you know apologia is the wrong word its a fancy word for autobiography you apologise to god not to your colleagues
1021050 my own preference would be for him to stay on and defeat this dreadful government but i can well see the other point of view
1021051 she will support her husband shes a loyal wife in that sense not that she doesnt have views of her own she would say its after all his life and he has to live it if he goes back to canberra
1021052 its pretty well established you do a count of the votes and the support and you either expect to win and if you havent got the numbers you dont do it or you think there would be some advantage in splitting the party which was something that peter would never do between those two he was stymied the third thing being the prime ministers unyielding attitude
1021053 at the beginning peter was providing the autobiographical information and i was doing the writing
1021054 there were no barneys there were disagreements and they are continuing but they were all amicably settled or put aside
1021055 the prisoner and her brother decided to have the father murdered believing that they would then be able to control how the monies from the sales of the properties would be distributed
1021056 the house means a lot to us i have come to this path
1021057 theres a whipping post in the corner the coat check room is manned by girls in lingerie and women of all ages and body types are dressed in tight corsets while men reveal far more of their bodies than most people would ever want to see
1021058 this will now make it easier for mums and dads to check if the child care centres or preschools theyre sending their kids to are actually doing the right thing
1021059 the names of centres and the operators will be published if they have convictions against them or are forced to have major amendments made to their licence conditions
1021060 when i meet someone who says theyve seen something strange thats fair enough because maybe they have i dont know what it is though
1021061 the first time you meet an abductee as they are called it can be quite confronting because they are trying to come to terms with it it is something that can stay with people a long time
1021062 where they are working it into their own indigenous belief systems
1021063 in the andes in chile they showed me a rock where they claimed an alien had stepped and left a footprint in the rock
1021064 they are still working out their entry visas but they should be in the country anytime from now

1021067 the pastor in our church who was among those who refused to leave the area eventually came out early this week leading all those who remained behind with him
1021068 there are no more people living in abana they have all come back to ikang and akpabuyo and even to calabar and no more business there we do not usually have passengers going there anymore and i cannot carry you alone to the place
1021069 the conference of nigeria political parties cnpp says no to handover of bakassi and other nigerian territories to cameroon without plebiscite
1021070 we may need to remind president yaradua that in the plebiscite of 1961 both areas of the north and south voted to remain in nigeria the people remain the most critical element in deciding whether to cede a territory or not they were not consulted and yet sovereignty rests with the people
1021071 conference of nigeria political parties cnpp says no to handover of bakassi and other nigerian territories to cameroun without plebcite
1021072 we predicate our submission on the fact that the green tree agreement was a self serving agreement born out of the desire of ex president chief olusegun obasanjo to gain international recognition in his bid for life president
1021073 we are constrained to agree that president umaru yar adua as a beneficiary of the failure of 3rd term cannot consign this agreement to the dust bin of history and allow the people of bakassi and other parts of nigeria ceded to benefit from the exit of chief obasanjo and consequently the fall of 3rd term
1021074 cnpp views the argument of the attorney general and minister of justice michael aondoaka that nigeria must obey the international court of justice icj as paradoxical
1021075 paradoxical in the sense that the same government is in league with those who support president omar bashir to disobey the order of the international criminal court indicting omar bashir on the darfur crisis despite the culpability of president bashir in the darfur inferno that had consumed many nigerian troops
1021076 secondly and most importantly the green tree agreement did not accommodate the local realities nor were the national assembly and the armed forces duly consulted infact it was flatly unconstitutional and born out of the whims and caprices of a maverick lacking broad electoral base
1021077 we may need to remind president yar adua that in the plebcite of 1961 both areas of the north and south voted to remain in nigeria the people remain the most critical element in deciding whether to cede a territory or not they were not consulted and yet sovereignty rests with the people
1021078 we shall have for the second time the opportunity to choose who will govern us therefore it should be a day in which everyone capable of voting should carry out this civic and patriotic right
1021079 the british government has been dragging the chain up until now our government has vehemently denied it john howard categorically stated that nobody suffered any significant effect because nobody was subject to serious levels of radiation
1021080 ive asked my department to liaise with the uk department of defence to find out more details and urgently report back to me
1021081 birth deformities with offspring have been transferred from the people who worked there
1021082 the way we did backup before was entirely user based and we had to trust them to do it
1021083 the biggest problem is we work around the clock every day and my backup window became non existent because the guys would always have the files open
1021084 tapes were too slow unreliable and expensive and the backup window for what we did was too big
1021085 if we dont have the data at the end of a flight we may as well not have gone up
1021086 if they blow up the laptop stand on the usb stick or drop it all out of the aeroplane i have a copy of it as well so we can recover that data
1021087 usually before the plane lands the navigator puts the usb into the laptop and it back up to the usb stick
1021088 once they get back into the office they can plug their laptop into the network put in the usb stick again and it will make another copy of that data across the wire into a database that i have access to
1021089 i can recover data remotely on any site without talking to anybody in seconds instead of hours and it gives us peace of mind that we wont lose our data
1021090 wollongong for instance has about 28 minutes of backup a night and that is a full backup of all changes on all files across 20tb
1021091 it will probably roll out to some managers who spend a bit more time remotely from the office
1021092 that would mean if my building burns down i can recover it all from one of the other sites and vice versa
1021093 we had full written approval from canberra to import the savannahs now action is going to be taken against us when we have done everything right
1021094 we were praised by the government for implementing contracts like ours
1021095 our pet only contract meant that no one could buy our cats unless they were de sexed
1021096 its open and shut as far as the lawyers are concerned
1021097 it was so cool man you should have gone etc

1021101 it is great if you like to run but dont run everyday try biking or swimming some days do some different things that way you are giving your muscles a rest and using them in different ways
1021102 one of the things to do is get a workout buddy because if that person is there and waiting for you to exercise youre less likely to blow things off
1021103 when you are watching the olympics there are commercials go outside have a little bit of a walk do a few crunches keep moving as much as you can because it all makes a difference
1021104 parents need to get out there and have fun because the kids will see their parents doing it and theyll want to join in
1021105 definitely set some family time aside each week so that you can go bike riding play tennis or even go on a walk as long as youre doing it together its not only family time its fun
1021106 you dont have to be an olympic athlete to see the benefits of exercise
1021107 three times of exercise a week to start and more as you progress will give you huge benefits
1021108 one of the biggest problems buyers of very expensive wines have at auctions is that they have no way of being absolutely sure if the bottle contains the wine it purports to without actually opening the bottle and taking a swig
1021109 theres no alarm that screams at you if the wines been opened
1021110 but theres no way of getting rid of the evidence of tampering because basically when tampering occurs information is erased a kind of anti alarm
1021111 our device may be able to generate a certain snob appeal factor among winemakers they can say our wine is so good we needed to spend money on this security device although only a few dollars of parts are used in the device
1021112 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the u s hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
1021113 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
1021114 it s important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the number of new infections but reflects our ability to more precisely measure hiv incidence and secure a better understanding of the epidemic
1021115 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
1021116 too many americans continue to be affected by this disease
1021117 these new findings emphasize the importance of reaching all hiv infected individuals and those at risk with effective prevention programs
1021118 prevention can and does work when we apply what we know
1021119 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
1021120 these data confirm the critical need to revitalize prevention efforts for gay and bisexual men of all races and to build upon the growing momentum in the african american and hispanic communities to confront hiv
1021121 we must all remember that we are dealing with one of the most insidious infectious diseases in history reducing this threat will require action from everyone individuals at risk community leaders government agencies and the private sector
1021122 noveras goal has always been to develop technologies that make it easier for carriers to deliver ethernet class fttx services to their customers

1021168 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1021169 now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions
1021170 because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1021171 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another barack obama a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate a president wholl stand up for you
1021172 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1021173 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said
1021174 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
1021175 im not going to do it just because bushhitler and the rethuglicans want me to
1021176 weve been blessed to have school teachers probation officers and interested community folks who have schedules that allow them to work

1021185 he just showed up here one day and started doing the kinds of repairs no one else knew how to do or wanted to tackle
1021186 sometimes people come into your life by accident and they give so much im grateful to bekim he is honest dependable extremely kind and sensitive he must have had a gentle upbringing
1021187 when i met bekim he was just a wonderful surprise for the amount of work he gives he does not overcharge
1021188 bekim told me hed do his best so the dust would go down the alley
1021189 we had to look all over for enough pavers for the patio
1021190 we found pavers all over the property and in the back alley we were given some from neighbors
1021191 no one wants to do this work for a reasonable rate homeowners dont want to pay commercial rates
1021192 people get these huge quotes and then put off the repairs and the deterioration gets worse
1021193 one neighbor on moss was fighting a roof leak for years bekim was able to determine it was really a mortar issue not the roof
1021194 you just dont see that kind of work ethic rand said
1021195 people leave tuckpointing so long the damage gets worse its better to repair it as soon as it starts to fall
1021196 in italy nothing less than 600 years old here 100 to 150 years old
1021197 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1021198 knapp is a firm believer in the 4 h program and the benefits that the youths and their families gain from participating
1021199 she models positive behaviors for all of her 4 h families whenever she has the opportunity
1021200 all of her kids have been out of 4 h for years thats one of the reasons we nominated her she is so dedicated
1021201 he spends most of his time working behind the scenes so his work could easily get overlooked
1021202 his calm demeanor puts all youths and adults who come in contact with him at ease so no matter what crisis comes up dennis is always there to quietly see what needs to be done and just does it
1021203 no matter how dirty gross or difficult the job is he is there working to clean it up these qualities make him an excellent role model for our 4 h youths
1021204 whenever tempers flare he is one you want to have around
1021205 dennis is great at soothing people and working out conflict he also has a great sense of humor that helps people to lighten up he is a great ambassador for the 4 h program
1021206 we believe that he is definitely a volunteer for all the right reasons and it shows in everything he does
1021207 i remember when watching some of the documentaries on crack cocaine the allegation that an individual became addicted after the first use of crack cocaine while it does happen it sometimes doesnt it depends on the psychological makeup of the person
1021208 i think some very influential politicians pushed it pretty hard
1021209 some personal observations of mine in driving through areas in kankakee i see pushers they have their turf so to speak theyre minorities mostly but what i also see is that the greatest number of their clients are young white middle class people
1021210 but when you talk to the community at large about addiction there seems to be an attitude that drug use and addiction is only a problem in certain parts of the city
1021211 work across those lines between the sellers and the users of drugs and not just those who sell drugs
1021212 its not what you know or who you know its who knows you
1021213 hey i think this might be of value to you
1021214 most countries still have a long way to go to meet the goal
1021215 just as important in most countries stigma against people living with hiv remains a grave challenge
1021216 they are wonderfully courageous and motivated people and should serve as an example to us all on how to act with dignity in the face of adversity
1021217 that they should be discriminated against including through restrictions on their ability to travel between countries should fill us with shame
1021218 i am dai bua aunt to some and dai dadi granny to most of the villagers it feels nice when all the families and children i have delivered shower so much love and respect it makes my work worthwhile and boosts my confidence in my abilities even at this age
1021219 no one had told me about how to handle pregnancy i was very frightened there was no hospital nearby it was a dai who took care of me like a mother
1021220 i was nervous as it was my sisters daughter in law i knew how to induce labour pain by giving hot herbal drinks made by boiling methi fenugreek seeds ajwain carom seeds and soya i used a sickle to cut the chord and after the birth gave the mother two spoons of diluted brandy
1021221 we will always be in her debt our son manjit who is 10 now owes his life to her she kept massaging for half an hour and that too briskly considering her age at that time shanti was 70 it was nothing short of a miracle for us
1021222 women prefer to have home deliveries by someone they know rather than an unknown doctor further the hospital is some distance away while the dai is right there and readily available shantis long experience has enabled her to predict when a delivery will take place on seeing a pregnant woman even if the baby is positioned feet first she is able to conduct deliveries in addition she provides information on immunisation birth registration and nutrition shanti is an icon here because she has made a big difference to womens health by using her traditional skills and knowledge
1021223 most countries still have a long way to go to meet the goal
1021224 just as important in most countries stigma against people living with hiv remains a grave challenge
1021225 they are wonderfully courageous and motivated people and should serve as an example to us all on how to act with dignity in the face of adversity
1021226 that they should be discriminated against including through restrictions on their ability to travel between countries should fill us with shame
1021227 i gave him judah a visual check three different times
1021228 i had to believe him that he indeed couldnt see
1021229 the reason he couldnt see had nothing to do with the cut i removed the blood and he said he still couldnt see
1021230 i thought i was wining the fight but i was disappointed
1021231 definitely the whole arena believes that i won this fight
1021232 it was a good fight but you dont take a fight on a head butt
1021233 it happened early in the fight well push for a rematch
1021234 we talked about this over and over and over again he clottey got disqualified in previous fights for head butts it happened again
1021235 he blocks with his hands so i wasnt able to get through
1021236 you know i didnt think that it was a head butt i threw a right hand
1021237 he never hurt me in my boxing life nobody hurts me
1021238 i dont want to be a contender i want to be a champion ive been all over the world and i want to thank bob arum he made me a champion im thanking him with all my heart
1021239 if top rank wanted me to do that i would
1021240 in my background ive become known for having done one thousand drawings in a year a self imposed marathon to get myself out of a rut of obsessing on one piece at a time trying to make everything perfect
1021241 youre already twenty five drawings behind based on what weve been doing so thats what you need to do today youve got to catch up i wasnt asking him to do finished quality work but thats the amount of effort well he got very frustrated very quickly and didnt complete the assignment
1021242 it made me think well is this a practice what you preached kind of thing is it unreasonable to try to get somebody to push themselves to see what happens when you do that
1021243 so i did my own twenty five drawings that night i brought them in and went and got the class including the uninterested student and showed them that not only is this possible its really something if you wanted to do one thing to improve your attitude towards working push it and dont obsess on each individual piece and dont start thinking about whether its any good or is it even when the teacher wants
1021244 there are lots of people who have great amounts of talents that go wasted
1021245 well if you kept this up for a year what do you think you would do
1021246 and its probably a real pivotal time in both my artistic career and in my teaching career one of the classes that came directly from that was a course called one hundred drawings where every student had to do one hundred drawings actually it should have been called two hundred drawings because they had to do one hundred in class and a hundred for homework during the semester thats still a very popular class at mass art
1021247 the first one was at the milwaukee institute of art where i showed the full thousand drawing collection and that led to other shows that had turn outs throughout the united states japan ireland china australia i think the fascination was the process of creating
1021248 i had the opportunity to teach at the central academy of china in beijing
1021249 not only can you call the class that thats in fact much what it is that i do
1021250 kind of forces you to use that power of intuition
1021251 if you cant see what youre doing you have to rely on your instincts to move the color around
1021252 each one of these paintings is an expression of my internal psyche and every piece that i do begins from a blank page and then more than anything i allow the material that i work with if im working with charcoal or if im working with acrylics or combinations of printmaking or others like i let them tell me what to do or where to go
1021253 youre not self conscious and youre not conscious of the idea of again what is it that im trying to make where do i want this to go but allowing yourself to be led by the process itself
1021254 ive searched through a lot of different rectangular formats to find i think all artists have a window
1021255 again it goes to that idea of finding something within the paper and rather than dreading a blank piece of paper id look at it as an opportunity to really find something that i didnt know was there
1021256 and when i got into doing one thousand drawings that was too ridiculous too i figured out when i was into 150 drawings that i better start numbering these and dating them that first series was in 1995 and im not doing one thousand drawings a year by now but all of those boxes over there for example have 130 in each box and theres my guess three thousand
1021257 by not knowing what im going to make when i start whats going to happen where is it going to go makes the process more of a challenge and an interest
1021258 the restrictions placed on journalists the ongoing crackdown in tibet and the treatment of individual chinese protesters has worsened
1021259 i therefore urge you not to attend the closing ceremony of the beijing games or indeed any other ceremonies associated with them
1021260 given chinas utter failure to deliver on its human rights promises it is simply untenable for any representative of the united kingdom to give political endorsement to these games
1021261 given the evidence that china has failed to meet the solemn commitments it gave i believe it is now clear that awarding the olympic games to china was a mistake
1021262 lays out as the title implies prior theories of privacy
1021263 is where the book transitions from a review of whats come before to new analysis
1021264 points out that one of the reasons were losing privacy is that its often portrayed as an individual right based on hiding something
1021265 no similar weapon in the service of armies in the world
1021266 all you idiots out there who dont get global warming because youre a bunch of underdeveloped buffoons need to shut up and sit down just because we cant prove what we are saying doesnt mean it isnt true dan rather anyone we have college degrees and work at really really important places so you should just take what we say as the gospel truth only republicans disagree with us anyway and everyone knows they are just a bunch of big oil lovers if we dont take dramatic steps to eliminate capitalism we will all die
1021267 the worlds climate warmed from 1680 up to 1940 but since 1940 its been cooling down the evidence for warming is because of distorted records the satellite data for example shows cooling
1021268 theres been warming no question ive never debated that never disputed that the dispute is what is the cause and of course the argument that human co 2 being added to the atmosphere is the cause just simply doesnt hold up
1021269 the temperature hasnt gone up but the mood of the world has changed it has heated up to this belief in global warming
1021270 temperatures declined from 1940 to 1980 and in the early 1970s global cooling became the consensus by the 1990s temperatures appeared to have reversed and global warming became the consensus it appears ill witness another cycle before retiring as the major mechanisms and the global temperature trends now indicate a cooling
1021271 the two main scientific claims of the ipcc are the claim that the globe is warming and increases in carbon dioxide emissions are responsible evidence for both of these claims is fatally flawed
1021272 will amount to less than 1 c of global warming and such a scenario is unlikely to arise given our limited reserves of fossil fuels certainly not before the end of this century
1021273 the blind adherence to the harebrained idea that climate models can generate realistic simulations of climate is the principal reason why i remain a climate skeptic from my background in turbulence i look forward with grim anticipation to the day that climate models will run with a horizontal resolution of less than a kilometer the horrible predictability problems of turbulent flows then will descend on climate science with a vengeance
1021274 models used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc are incoherent and invalid from a scientific point of view
1021275 global warming results not from the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere but from an unusually high level of solar radiation and a lengthy almost throughout the last century growth in its intensity
1021276 t he recent warming trend in the surface temperature record cannot be caused by the increase of human made greenhouse gases in the air
1021277 its absurd of course its going up it has gone up since the early 1800s before the industrial revolution because were coming out of the little ice age not because were putting more carbon dioxide into the air
1021278 the authors identify and describe the following global forces of nature driving the earths climate 1 solar radiation 2 outgassing as a major supplier of gases to the world ocean and the atmosphere and possibly 3 microbial activities the writers provide quantitative estimates of the scope and extent of their corresponding effects on the earths climate and show that the human induced climatic changes are negligible
1021279 that portion of the scientific community that attributes climate warming to co
1021280 the observed pattern of warming comparing surface and atmospheric temperature trends does not show the characteristic fingerprint associated with greenhouse warming the inescapable conclusion is that the human contribution is not significant and that observed increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases make only a negligible contribution to climate warming
1021281 global warming since 1900 could well have happened without any effect of co2 if the cycles continue as in the past the current warm cycle should end soon and global temperatures should cool slightly until about 2035
1021282 this small warming is likely a result of the natural alterations in global ocean currents which are driven by ocean salinity variations ocean circulation variations are as yet little understood human kind has little or nothing to do with the recent temperature changes we are not that influential
1021283 i am of the opinion that global warming is one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated on the american people
1021284 so many people have a vested interest in this global warming thing all these big labs and research and stuff the idea is to frighten the public to get money to study it more
1021285 there has been a real climate change over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries that can be attributed to natural phenomena natural variability of the climate system has been underestimated by ipcc and has to now dominated human influences
1021286 what i think is this man is responsible for a part of global warming most of it is still natural
1021287 about half of the warming during the 20th century occurred prior to the 1940s and natural variability accounts for all or nearly all of the warming
1021288 the possible causes then of climate change are well established orbital parameters on the palaeoclimatic scale solar activity volcanism and far at the rear the greenhouse effect and in particular that caused by water vapor the extent of its influence being unknown these factors are working together all the time and it seems difficult to unravel the relative importance of their respective influences upon climatic evolution equally it is tendentious to highlight the anthropic factor which is clearly the least credible among all those previously mentioned
1021289 there is no meaningful correlation between co 2 levels and earths temperature over this geologic time frame in fact when co 2 levels were over ten times higher than they are now about 450 million years ago the planet was in the depths of the absolute coldest period in the last half billion years on the basis of this evidence how could anyone still believe that the recent relatively small increase in co 2 levels would be the major cause of the past centurys modest warming
1021290 we only have to have one volcano burping and we have changed the whole planetary climate it looks as if carbon dioxide actually follows climate change rather than drives it
1021291 t he truth is probably somewhere in between the common view and that of skeptics with natural causes probably being more important over the past century whereas anthropogenic causes will probably be more dominant over the next century a bout 2 3s give or take a third or so of the warming over the past century should be attributed to increased solar activity and the remaining to anthropogenic causes
1021292 its not automatically true that warming is bad i happen to believe that warming is good and so do many economists
1021293 t heres increasingly strong evidence that previous research conclusions including those of the united nations and the united states government concerning 20th century warming may have been biased by underestimation of natural climate variations the bottom line is that if these variations are indeed proven true then yes natural climate fluctuations could be a dominant factor in the recent warming in other words natural factors could be more important than previously assumed
1021294 the myth is starting to implode serious new research at the max planck institute has indicated that the sun is a far more significant factor
1021295 our team has discovered that the relatively few cosmic rays that reach sea level play a big part in the everyday weather they help to make low level clouds which largely regulate the earths surface temperature during the 20th century the influx of cosmic rays decreased and the resulting reduction of cloudiness allowed the world to warm up most of the warming during the 20th century can be explained by a reduction in low cloud cover
1021296 at this stage two scenarios of potential human impact on climate appear feasible 1 the standard ipcc model and 2 the alternative model that argues for celestial phenomena as the principal climate driver models and empirical observations are both indispensable tools of science yet when discrepancies arise observations should carry greater weight than theory if so the multitude of empirical observations favours celestial phenomena as the most important driver of terrestrial climate on most time scales but time will be the final judge
1021297 t he method of study adopted by the international panel of climate change ipcc is fundamentally flawed resulting in a baseless conclusion most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations contrary to this statement there is so far no definitive evidence that most of the present warming is due to the greenhouse effect the ipcc should have recognized that the range of observed natural changes should not be ignored and thus their conclusion should be very tentative the term most in their conclusion is baseless
1021298 i t is very likely that the recent upward trend in global surface temperature is very real and that the upward signal is greater than any noise introduced from uncertainties in the record however the general error is most likely to be in the warming direction with a maximum possible though unlikely value of 0 3 c at this moment in time we know only that 1 global surface temperatures have risen in recent decades 2 mid tropospheric temperatures have warmed little over the same period 3 this difference is not consistent with predictions from numerical climate models
1021299 im sure the majority but not all of my ipcc colleagues cringe when i say this but i see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see
1021300 carbon dioxide should not be considered as a dominant force behind the current warming how much of the temperature increase can be ascribed to co 2 to changes in solar activity or to the natural variability of climate is uncertain
1021301 it is an open question if human produced changes in climate are large enough to be detected from the noise of the natural variability of the climate system
1021302 there is evidence of global warming but warming does not confirm that carbon dioxide is causing it climate is always warming or cooling there are natural variability theories of warming to support the argument that carbon dioxide is causing it the evidence would have to distinguish between human caused and natural warming this has not been done
1021303 the amount of climatic warming that has taken place in the past 150 years is poorly constrained and its cause human or natural is unknown there is no sound scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty if the climate does warm it is likely to be beneficial to humanity rather than harmful in my opinion it would be foolish to establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria
1021304 we are quite confident 1 that global mean temperature is about 0 5 c higher than it was a century ago 2 that atmospheric levels of co 2 have risen over the past two centuries and 3 that co 2 is a greenhouse gas whose increase is likely to warm the earth one of many the most important being water vapor and clouds but and i cannot stress this enough we are not in a position to confidently attribute past climate change to co 2 or to forecast what the climate will be in the future
1021305 t here has been no question whatsoever that co 2 is an infrared absorber i e a greenhouse gas albeit a minor one and its increase should theoretically contribute to warming indeed if all else were kept equal the increase in co 2 should have led to somewhat more warming than has been observed
1021306 we need to find out how much of the warming we are seeing could be due to mankind because i still maintain we have no idea how much you can attribute to mankind
1021307 the rising co2 content of the air should boost global plant productivity dramatically enabling humanity to increase food fiber and timber production and thereby continue to feed clothe and provide shelter for their still increasing numbers this atmospheric co 2 derived blessing is as sure as death and taxes
1021308 w arming has been shown to positively impact human health while atmospheric co
1021309 what this deduction does is say that almost 10 percent of the profits manufacturers earn cant be taxed
1021310 we are up against well financed business interests who say we just want to raise taxes on business and can afford to run expensive marketing campaigns to keep the deduction
1021311 manufacturing employs 675 000 people in illinois and we contribute 13 percent to the states gross domestic product illinois manufacturers have lost 200 000 jobs since 2000 everytime the general assembly or the governor tries to eliminate an incentive like this it just hurts those 675 000 workers

1021322 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic

1021349 oh good im glad im not the only one who thinks this isnt normal
1021350 primarily to reflect a challenging cost inflation environment less pricing recovery in europe and weaker fiscal third quarter 2008 results
1021351 we expect little improvement in the european paper business due to industry overcapacity and lack of pricing discipline north american paper demand continues to decline due to the weak u s economy and soft advertising market and we do not see valuation as sufficiently compelling
1021352 the company continues to demonstrate improved operational results and steady growth

1021364 there was no evidence of policy exchanging displaying party political bias towards the conservative party or any other political party
1021365 i admit my other example looks dodgy and might be more to do with police overreach generally than political correctness specifically
1021366 i acknowledge that the authoritarian right has been instrumental in introducing
1021367 if a black chap had been quizzed by the cops for an hour for suggesting that white people were devils and should go to hell and then released with 10k compo im entirely certain that youd be spinning that as an example of political correctness gone mad too

1021369 we failed to hit the target and blew up lots of innocent civilians
1021370 most of the stories about councils banning black dustbin bags and making children sing
1021371 i would rather use the free market and free expression to challenge prejudiced views as has been demonstrably successful in the past
1021372 all signficant advances in race relations have been due to political and legal action none have bee due to

1021410 im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run thats it
1021411 the whole thing has been a race against time and a nightmare from when it was diagnosed and everythings had to change and adapt to that
1021412 im getting more confident day by day because every day that you run more on it it gets stronger
1021413 the aim has always been to start the race every day i go out and plan to start the race but im running on a leg that could break down
1021414 its just the fact that because ive not been running huge amounts at full body weight outside on it they team gb dont know whether it will get me there
1021415 the only decision that would be made would be made for me and i dont want to think about that
1021416 we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1021417 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1021418 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
1021419 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1021420 this vaccination would need to be given every year to be effective
1021421 we know that influenza affects the vulnerable the elderly and the young and we also know that flu causes a lot of problems in terms of health and also with the economy with people being off work and so on
1021422 we welcome this analysis but also believe that extra work needs to be done

1021428 the trust has identified a total of 19 new cases of clostridium difficile in july 2008
1021429 this is a reduction of four on the previous month and the trend shows a continuing fall in the rate of new infections this is the lowest number of new infection cases in the trust for more than 12 months
1021430 such cases are difficult and distressing for clinical and medical staff in the trust
1021431 there is considerably less transmission of the infection within trust hospitals that our infection prevention control and isolation procedures are working
1021432 we are however seeing an increase in the number of relapsed cases this is a reflection of the nature of the illness that can reoccur in some patients for several months depending on the patients primary condition and whether there is a need to prescribe further antibiotic treatment all of these patients have low levels of immunity to infection
1021433 we are also seeing an increase in the number of patients developing symptoms within 48 hours of admission to hospital which indicates that they were infected when admitted

1021440 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1021441 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 meters 26 000 feet due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was
1021442 my hands are fine while my feet are black from frostbite anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1021443 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now
1021444 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
1021445 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
1021446 thats an awful lot of carbon we do not want emitted into the atmosphere
1021447 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests

1021449 weve got to have a re look at this and re establish if we need to vote on this if someone puts their hat in the ring whether brendan is going to still stay as leader or we get a different one
1021450 were being clouded out by leadership issues rather than real issues and really at this time the labor government should frankly be on the nose
1021451 i find them quite incompetent and they sought of articulate a lot and do nothing and they even seem confused about what theyre doing
1021452 in the meantime were stuck in this leadership thing which is very sad
1021453 people generally expect politicians to stand up and have the courage and fight for what they want and take it
1021454 were not getting enough focus now on those huge issues right now because i have to say the media seems more interested in what happens in party rooms

1021458 it means there is some inflation leaking into the system and it puts the fed in a difficult position
1021459 but given the weakness of the economy it means theyre going to have to tolerate more inflation than they like
1021460 if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him that would be a tragedy

1021487 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
1021488 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
1021489 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
1021490 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
1021491 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
1021492 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
1021493 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
1021494 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
1021495 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
1021496 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
1021497 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
1021498 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
1021499 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
1021500 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
1021501 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
1021502 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
1021503 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
1021504 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
1021505 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
1021506 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
1021507 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
1021508 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
1021509 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
1021510 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
1021511 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
1021512 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
1021513 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
1021514 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
1021515 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
1021516 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
1021517 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
1021518 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
1021519 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
1021520 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
1021521 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
1021522 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
1021523 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
1021524 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
1021525 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
1021526 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
1021527 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
1021528 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
1021529 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
1021530 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
1021531 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
1021532 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
1021533 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
1021534 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off

1021536 die besch ftigten der technik arbeiten in einem besonders starken gesch ftsfeld und haben den streik getragen da gibt es schon eine gewisse ern chterung
1021537 allein in der technik hat sie nicht zu so gro em jubel gef hrt
1021538 obviously we need to get our house in order i just dont think we need to do it on a daily basis via the media
1021539 in my view its detrimental to our prospects at upcoming state elections
1021540 so i wrote to her a diplomatic letter but with some hints of romance meaning i was very warm towards her
1021541 so i was a total failure in trying to seduce amanda vanstone she was not terribly impressed
1021542 never has this much sediment been released at once into such an active and hungry river
1021543 marmot is certainly one of the best documented and most spectacular examples of dam removal in the sense that the river was allowed to process the material itself
1021544 that is a very different river system h said the dam was built in 1913 to generate power but pge decided in 1999 that updating it to help declining fish runs would cost more than its energy value a question was whether pge should scoop out the sediment behind the dam or simply blow it up and let it go just in case teams took wild fall chinook salmon from spawning areas to a hatchery where the fry were raised to be released into the river to keep the stock going the dam never blocked salmon passage a fish ladder allowed fish to get past the dam and some fish advocates were disappointed to see the dam go because it kept hatchery raised fish from mingling with wild salmon above the dam biologists could sort the fish as they entered the fish ladder allowing the wild fish upstream past the dam but keeping the hatchery fish out making the upper reaches effectively a sanctuary for wild fish but bill bakke executive director of the native fish society said the upside is that it lays more groundwork for a lot more dam removals which have value for our rivers
1021545 bicycles are legally vehicles on the roadway and theyre entitled to space on the roadway
1021546 ceased to exist as a band for the purpose of the indian act it does not however mean that the sinixt ceased to exist as a tribal group
1021547 were talking about for all intents and purposes asserting a right to be consulted and to consent to all uses or dispositions of crown land within that territory
1021548 its about growing your own vegetables its about taking direct action its about working with your community on making the world youd like to see in the shell of the old
1021549 i would like to remain silent uh huh uh huh uh huh i would like to see my lawyer oh yeah oh yeah
1021550 the police are on the phone and theyre on their way right now
1021551 if i see one piece of litter in here youll be arrested in fact youre so dirty i think youre going to get litter charges just being here
1021552 eight days of low impact living and high impact action
1021553 we dont have to bring in any fossil fuels we dont have to fell any trees
1021554 this is a grant funded project from a bona fide clean air agency
1021555 if we didnt get it cleaned up after a number of years of effort it could affect our ability to get federal highway funds
1021556 thats why its important to begin working on this now we certainly dont want to affect any federally funded highway project in our region
1021557 we want to first believe that this is a localized problem
1021558 hopefully it is a wood stove problem and not an automobile emissions problem
1021559 i either didnt see it or i thought it was a sale
1021560 its going to give you a false sense of security
1021561 if right around the gauge you have clean air and then you go a couple miles down the road and its dirty
1021562 i think primary care is going to be the saviour of acute care over the next 30 to 40 years
1021563 im absolutely convinced we will not be able to meet the challenges demographic chronic disease etc of the next 30 to 40 years without a far more robust and inclusive primary care system than weve ever had
1021564 the coast guard no longer needs the cape arago lighthouse for navigation purposes and this will put an historic piece of land to good use while protecting and preserving its cultural significance
1021565 they were looking for a small business owner that is getting into that market through my involvement with neca i fit the bill
1021566 i testified on thursday july 10 but the day before that i went around with neca we visited sen ron wydens office and stressed how important it is that green technology gets done
1021567 this year we have contracts worth 2 million for solar panel installations which represents almost 25 percent of our total business
1021568 for 2009 i can project an additional 2 million worth of opportunities for those seeking building retrofit and other investment in green energy technologies
1021569 just last year i invested in my companys infrastructure and retrofitted our roofing system with a 212 000 solar panel unit
1021570 i had projected a 20 year payback on the system but with increasing energy costs and the potential to sell off extra power through potential utility buyback programs i believe my investment will exceed my earlier predictions
1021571 a car pulled up this adorable little car that said electric on the doors and i pretty much fell in love with it that instant
1021572 our concern is that these cars dont have to meet the safety standards that regular vehicles do
1021573 these vehicles wouldnt even be a match for a small car like a honda civic let alone the pickups and suvs that are out there
1021574 if these vehicles caught on in any numbers wed have to do some crash tests they never really did catch on but now with gas prices the way they are theyve bubbled up to the surface
1021575 if im in an accident unless its somebody purposely plowing through me i dont feel theres a danger an accident is more severe at higher speeds
1021576 aluminium cans 900 450 a bale tin cans 150 no 2 clear plastic 300 cardboard 70 mixed paper 40
1021577 might be the most overlooked beneficiary of the commodities boom
1021578 if commodity prices fall people will be unwilling to bear higher tax rates from cities to maintain unprofitable recycling programmes
1021579 its a huge issue when you have an epidemic particularly when its in lodgepole and it spreads to other species
1021580 any time that happens near a community and recreation area you have public safety concerns
1021581 a road to allow the premiers rich friends to drive to their million dollar homes at a ski resort
1021582 we looked there and found precious stones that did not belong there stones that came from the eastern part of oregon
1021583 many people would make the long trip some would get sick get tired their health would give way and they would never make it back so they would be put away along the trail
1021584 if one of their people died on the bluff they would have petitioned the tumwata to allow the burial
1021585 and if the tumwata gave the go ahead the burial would have adhered to tumwata traditions and ceremonies
1021586 ancestral lands are far away it is outside their purview to claim these lands
1021587 when people find out that there are burial sites and other sites of significance they come and disturb the site
1021588 it shows a near unprecedented drop in expected revenues the only one we know of greater was after 9 11
1021589 i dont want to tell people in west seattle i needed to reprogram rapidride money to pay for rising gas prices
1021590 when gasoline hit 4 50 a gallon the phone started ringing off the hook
1021591 our costs are usually about 50 percent more than conventional equipment
1021592 that 50 percent youll generally see back in about five years
1021593 another thing that puts a damper on it is we enjoy relatively low cost electricity
1021594 its also partly a function of how they potential buyers just havent seen much of it
1021595 geothermal power is a clean renewable resource with considerable potential in western washington
1021596 its a learning curve more than anything its about thinking out of the box
1021597 for many of our mountain commuters it is the only form of transportation that these people have
1021598 everything that we do is being undermined by the fuel crisis
1021599 you would put a lot of people out of work if you took their bus away from them
1021600 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
1021601 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
1021602 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
1021603 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately
1021604 disappointed that we have not yet been able to move this bill out of the senate
1021605 i think we can make this work and all i care about is the end result
1021606 and im here for one reason ive got to protect the health of the people i represent
1021607 given that the northern spotted owl has been experiencing about a 4 percent annual rate of population decline for the last 15 years any reductions from current levels of habitat protection cannot be justified
1021608 were most pleased to report that oregonians will share in the benefits that congress including most members of the states delegation approved and the president signed
1021609 calculations of the overall benefits to the state are in process we do not yet know the totals but we do know the dollar value is significant
1021610 you can build a lot of apartments and homes and help preserve many housing units with that kind of money
1021611 this is a valuable credit because it reflects real money
1021612 cities already have more carbon dioxide than rural areas and are hotter
1021613 it has been more difficult to find borrowers than we thought
1021614 we are going to walk our talk with financial support for local small scale agriculture
1021615 you still want name brand stuff but you find alternative ways to do it
1021616 each time the economy takes a dip we see more people looking to sell their clothes
1021617 its a way to get better quality for less money
1021618 golf is a bit of an elitist sport in that it costs a lot of money
1021619 shopping here you can buy a club for a third of the cost
1021620 a lot of people are downsizing and moving into smaller accommodations
1021621 people have to watch their pennies and look for good buys
1021622 daddy come quick my plant just moved when i tickled it
1021623 my daughter rebecca and i have successfully grown tickleme plants
1021624 it will be faster because it raises property values and developers expectations
1021625 if its going to be more expensive it may not be the answer to our problem
1021626 were being very conservative about the challenges we might face
1021627 you get to reap the benefit of the fact that the fuel is free
1021628 this is a watershed in need of a lot of help and repair
1021629 there was a lot of acrimonious finger pointing at first
1021630 but we decided that finger pointing was not going to solve the problem
1021631 the group felt so good about what came out of flat that they wanted to do more
1021632 the united states is both the worlds largest importer and producer and the second largest exporter of wood products imports and exports of both raw and value added wood products can directly affect domestic demand for timber increasing forest product imports may correspond with reduced demand for domestically grown timber thus helping to depress domestic stumpage prices both in the short and long run
1021633 growth in the market for new total desalination capacity should increase by approximately 13 percent per year from 2005 to 2015
1021634 it takes a lot of pressure to get the pure water to go away from the salt and it takes a lot of energy to pressurize the water
1021635 its not a bad analogy because perceptions are not always based on truth in either case
1021636 we expect sales outside the united states to remain a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future
1021637 a new brand of bus operator is emerging who point to their services as being the environmentally friendly travel choice people are starting to feel good about stepping aboard a bus many see it as a socially responsible way to go
1021638 increase awareness about reducing carbon emissions by encouraging bus travel
1021639 the fuel used on a megabus double decker driving from new york to washington d c amounts to 0 5 gallons of gas per passenger compare that to four people traveling by car for the same distance where its 2 75 gallons per passenger
1021640 how often do you see four people riding in a car more likely its just one passenger whats clear is the bus is much greener by far
1021641 just 10 years ago affluent travelers saw the bus as the last resort a sign of desperation
1021642 more young people more economically advantaged people you might say
1021643 were seeing a shift to a more european model with less emphasis on private car ridership
1021644 its already happening and its shaping how we design our country and how we move around it
1021645 in many ways it is hardly a political issue it is transcendent partisanship
1021646 government is partnering with private industry and washington state on a project that ultimately will benefit all british columbians
1021647 this project will boost tourism dollars reduce traffic congestion and ease vehicle emissions on our major transportation corridors and at our border crossings
1021648 and the project is expected to be completed by summer of 2008
1021649 the cbsa is currently in discussions with amtrak with regard to expanding cbsa services to accommodate a second train but it would be inappropriate to comment at this time
1021650 discussions to provide cbsa services to new locations or to expand current services take into account human resources and the ability to provide security and services to the public
1021651 in its first full year of operation the second amtrak passenger train from seattle to vancouver is expected to bring approximately 50 000 travellers to vancouver injecting an estimated 13 9 million into b c s economy
1021652 the legislature intends that critical areas within the jurisdiction of the shoreline management act shall be governed by the shoreline management act and that critical areas outside the jurisdiction of the shoreline management act shall be governed by the growth management act
1021653 this ruling has really created a lot of confusion for cities and counties trying to deal with this
1021654 i think the biggest problem we face now is getting rid of all the extreme conservationists that have weaseled their way into positions of power and inflict their own personal opinions into land use decisions
1021655 we have to make informed decisions on our land and resources
1021656 i think the biggest problem we face now is getting rid of all the extreme conservationists that have weaseled their way into positions of power and inflict their own personal opinions into land use decisions

1021660 the company with all diligence has attempted to avoid a bankruptcy filing
1021661 however the filing became necessary because of the recent failed effort to obtain financing and the recognition that the companys entire 1 8 of debt may soon be in default

1021670 if it were to include the name of every individual for whom it processed a payment that would be a whole nother story
1021671 this has nothing to do with the crisis in housing
1021672 the expected revenue does not seem to justify creating this reporting system and i worry if this is the start down a slippery slope in collecting detailed economic data on citizens
1021673 its kind of like being date raped which i like
1021674 if he wants to retract that it would be nice for the 9 000 people who have been drug raped in the past 12 years
1021675 it shows a total lack of understanding and compassion for the issues i hope everyone boycotts everything he does now

1021710 she will dance in front of her camera until she makes her man happy
1021711 guided the people of god to contemplate the face of christ
1021712 at the center of the bible and tradition the heart of the church the world and the whole universe
1021713 presided over the council to its closing and governed an eventful post conciliar phase
1021714 thanking god for the gift of this great pope let us commit to treasuring his teachings
1021715 there is reason to doubt the lawfulness of many abortions authorised by certifying consultants indeed the committee itself has stated that the law is being used more liberally than parliament intended
1021716 in my opinion the statistics and the committees comments over the years since the court of appeal made that observation do give rise to powerful misgivings about the lawfulness of many abortions
1021717 we hope that catholics around the state will recognize the moral and civic duty they have as catholics and citizens to vote and to do so with a properly formed conscience
1021718 if we as catholics want to effect change in our society and culture we must vote and encourage our friends and family to do the same
1021719 the catholic church certainly understands and also believes in the separation of church and state
1021720 but that doesnt mean we believe in the separation of faith and politics
1021721 faith is what drives the thinking of catholics of christians in terms of their relationship with god and also in terms of their relationship with their neighbor
1021722 because of that our political relationships which are about our relationship with our neighbor are informed by our faith so serious catholics whether politicians or ordinary voters have an obligation actually to make sure that faith informs their political decisions and their actions
1021723 we talk to men about the things that are happening in their lives right now and we challenge them to do something about it
1021724 guys respond to a challenge the lord will help them but they have to admit that something is not right in their life
1021725 men dont think of the lord when things are rockin and rollin when things start turning bad thats when we need to be available to the men
1021726 there is for me a special significance in signing this pledge and it will give me a peace of mind and heart that i have not experienced since 1968 in 1968 i was a young franciscan priest studying in the graduate school of religious education at catholic university
1021727 since they as well as many other professors and graduate students were signing the protest document i went along and did so also
1021728 in 1975 for personal reasons not related to any doubts or questions about the faith or the church or the religious life i requested and obtained a dispensation from pope paul vi returning me to the lay state later i was married in the church and raised my two children in the faith i have had many conversations with my pastor and with his assistant who is my spiritual director about my days as a franciscan priest and have been active in many of our parishs lay apostolate and ministries
1021729 but i have always regretted having signed the protest document against pope pauls teaching in 1968 and having learned a few years ago that fr faricy had publicly repudiated signing the protest i had wished that i too could repudiate in some official way having signed the protest and so your pledge document offers me an opportunity to correct my mistake and find healing and telling you about all this helps me to feel that my repudiation of the protest is now known and accepted in a kind of semi official sort of way by an authority in the church
1021730 and thank you for reading this thereby humoring an old man who despite everything else knows that he is a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
1021731 in christs kingdom it is never too late even after forty years to fully embrace the truth all of us make mistakes and all of us sin but he gives us all a chance to be reconciled with him and turn our sorrow into joy
1021732 scientists expect water scarcity to become more common in large part because the worlds population is rising and many people are getting richer thus expanding demand and because global climate change is exacerbating aridity and reducing supply in many regions
1021733 water is not in a criss situation 2 3 of the earths surface is covered by water peter rogers should turn in his word processor
1021734 on the other hand even a modest 10 percent rise in irrigation efficiency would free up more water than is evaporated off by all other users this goal could be achieved by stopping up leaks in the water delivery infrastructure and by implementing low loss storage of water as well as more efficient application of water to farm crops
1021735 growing populations need ever more water for drinking hygiene sanitation food production and industry
1021736 the only true crisis is the intelligence crisis only if people start using technology to meet our needs instead of trying to get their neighbor to use rocks for a yard instead of grass will we see our way clear of these created crises if we are to survive as a species we must recycle everything and use the energy and resources available in the solar system
1021737 but governments at all levels need to start setting policies and making investments in infrastructure for water conservation now
1021738 when you have loved three things all your life from the earliest you can remember to fish to shoot and later to read and when all your life the necessity to write had been your master you learn to remember and when you think back you remember more fishing and shooting and reading than anything else that is a pleasure
1021739 when i need a break from the obama brainwashing and my daily grind of writing and hosting clashradio com not only do i drink six gallons of ketel one dance on tables in greek restaurants and chill with mi familia as obama would have us say but i dream about and prepare for my next hu

1021742 this is a tragic incident but it is believed to be an isolated case which local police are treating as a robbery that went wrong
1021743 it is a top of the world feeling after an arduous trek of 2 5 kilometers
1021744 devi kol mandir mela samiti in his honour among the beats of the traditional instruments like
1021745 the place was best suited for trekking and eco tourism as nag tibba was just 10 k m away from this place
1021746 jaunpur has such hidden traditional festivals which need to be promoted and brought in limelight so that world is aware of such pristine culture and tradition of the region and that is possible by efforts of every member of the community
1021747 the sacred hoop shows how all things go in a circle the old becomes the new the new becomes the old everything repeats white people have no culture culture is having roots in the earth people without culture dont exist very long because nature is god without a connection to nature the people drift grow negative destroy themselves in the beginning we had one mind and it was positive a think of beauty seeing beauty everywhere

1021973 why hide that fact from our children its not like the children dont know theyre hearing seeing and witnessing all of that
1021974 they see it on the internet they see it on mtv they see it at school these are issues that kids can probably embrace and wrap their minds around more than adults
1021975 no 1 those choices need to be made by the parents
1021976 but no 2 by the time these kids are capable of getting in the computer and looking at the world by the time theyre 10 to 12 somewhere in there theyre knowing a lot of stuff
1021977 the real issue for the most part is one of choice if i have responsibility for my kids then i get to choose what it is they see therefore i help make a determination of whats important in their lives and it probably is what was important in my life as i was coming along
1021978 im no good at being noble but it doesnt take much to see that the problems of three little people dont amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world
1021979 the music is magnificent and ingrid bergman makes me want to buy a hat
1021980 i think it works largely because it is a lot of seasoned pros at the top of their game bogart bergman claude rains director mike curtiz producer hal wallis and writers the epstein brothers and howard koch a happy symbosis of great writing directing acting and producing
1021981 warners also had a great collection of strong supporting actors
1021982 it is also an example of the strengths of the studio system a stable of writers executives actors and artists working in an odd checks and balance system and with a repertorial connectness
1021983 it was also just a great deal of felicitious good luck would it be the same memorable picture if george raft had played rick with ann sheridan or michelle morgan as ilsa joe cotton as laslo clarence muse as sam otto preminger as strasser all casting considerations at one time
1021984 and lets not forget the whole thing had been based on a failed play called
1021985 providing some insights to the evolution of the film i recommend inside warner bros by rudy behlmer and casablanca script amp legend by howard koch
1021986 its ironic that this theme came up this week i recently had a strong urge to watch the movie for the hundredth time i find myself in a strange place when i watch the movie the romanticism of rick and ilsas relationship is of course a strong theme but there is something more i am reminded of the scene at ricks when the song duel took place the actors singing the french anthem showed such passion it stirred something in me as well the movie urges the watcher to move past your own desire to think of the greater good each of the characters ultimately did that
1021987 its all about the passing of eras and of persons passing by even as opportunity extends a hand and how melancholia and music can feed a souless self
1021988 change the time change the war reappoint new but as corrupt officials pick a new man and woman to play the central roles and the timelessness of the story will still make its point with us
1021989 you dont know yourself until youve been in the dark for a period of time
1021990 no use in asking god because this here is my cave and im the only one who knows the way out
1021991 i have been advised that i have the right to insist that any felony charge brought against me in federal court first be presented to a u s grand jury i would like to waive that right and agree to be prosecuted under information filed against me in this case by the united states attorney
1021992 acquistion executives are becoming increasingly irrelevant to the delivery of capabilities to end users
1021993 are all based on anonymous sources the veracity of which cannot be judged credible news organizations that do not have an ideological ax to grind do not generally make anonymous sources the foundation of stories thats why the mainstream media hasnt pursued this
1021994 when you view a cluster in google news theres a new option to filter sources you can restrict news articles to blogs and to local news sites that are relevant to your query the filters are a good way to find opinionated articles and more up to date information from local sites
1021995 if something happens to butch james then i cant bring in a guy who has not been playing
1021996 the players all need to keep sharp and its best if i allow the guys to play not standing around holding kit bags
1021997 because we have good relations with the provinces we can ask them to play these guys in certain positions
1021998 ruan pienaar has not played a lot at fly half and i had a long chat with john plumtree pienaar and steyns coach at the sharks and he knows why the players are there
1021999 we also have to get the composition of the whole team right
1022000 percy montgomery will never start a game at fly half while i am coach but if theres an emergency during the game then we can call on him and he will do a good job there
1022001 with any selection the landscape can change if i decide i want a second fly half on the bench then i can call ruan pienaar back immediately
1022002 look at that nate was in such a hurry he left his water bottle on top of the car oh thats hilarious
1022003 i told them i wasnt interested now but maybe later its a very interesting situation over in france at the moment
1022004 we just had to get down there and the thing is we couldnt get down there they didnt allow us
1022005 the only set plays we had at that point we scored points off we scored that penalty matt giteau and then we scored that try adam ashley cooper
1022006 it was frustrating in the sense that we couldnt get down there but they didnt let us
1022007 you knew to a point what they were going to do they just did it well and did it better
1022008 we have beaten them already but they are 10 15 points better over there
1022009 we got shown up in auckland and that wont happen again
1022010 this agreement presents an excellent opportunity for emission reductions beyond that which the texas commission on environmental quality tceq would have required
1022011 the greenhouse gas reductions 50 are particularly significant because the tceq does not consider carbon dioxide a pollutant and does not regulate or restrict carbon emissions
1022012 we applaud nrg committing to offset a significant part of its co 2 emissions from the limestone 3 plant co 2 is the gas that scientists tell us is the principal cause of global warming
1022013 offsets such as the projects that nrg has committed to invest in are a low cost way to get the large reductions in greenhouse gases that are necessary to prevent catastrophic impacts of global warming and nrg has established a precedent for other electricity companies to follow
1022014 the limestone expansion is part of our program to invest in texas with a balanced portfolio of nuclear gas wind and coal
1022015 we have appreciated working with environmental defense fund and the tcacc to bring this additional power to texas in an environmentally responsible manner and dramatically lower overall average emissions including co
1022016 we commend nrg for their willingness to work with the citizens of texas to produce a plant which adds power while reducing emissions from the site
1022017 with its commitment to undertake a utility scale solar project in texas either on its own or with other electric generators nrg can help lower the cost of this emerging and abundant clean energy resource and continue their efforts to advance technologies to reverse the threat of global warming
1022018 nrgs new build portfolio is focused on helping to meet the growing energy needs of texas with significantly less emissions per megawatt hour of power produced
1022019 these projects also include investments in wind and natural gas generation and ultimately bridge to zero carbon zero emission nuclear power collectively the carbon intensity of these new repowering projects will be 70 less than the current average in texas by working with tcacc and environmental defense fund and implementing the steps listed in these agreements we will reduce our carbon intensity even further it is an important step in our efforts to be a leader in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions
1022020 they do all sorts of typical fun camp stuff like kayaking snorkeling whitewater rafting rock climbing ropes courses all with the goal to promote team building
1022021 the camps also provide environmental education through activities like night hikes and more the biggest goal of these camps though is to just have fun since so many of these kids have extra stress
1022022 its not therapy but we do have a mental health consultant on hand just in case a kid does need some extra help
1022023 we recognize the burden that military families are under and wanted to be able to provide the healing benefits that come with outdoor experiences we want to make sure military families get to enjoy the natural wonders too as they make such sacrifices for the country

1022060 lionel messi is an incredibly exciting player and one who enjoys a world wide reputation for skill pace and all round ability
1022061 as such he is the ideal player to front pes 2009 and his enthusiasm for the new game is certain to shine as we work closely together in the promotion of what will be the most advanced pes title to date

1022105 though the particular terms of such enforcement action are not known at this time the company expects that it will require improvement in bank earnings lower nonperforming loan levels increased bank capital revisions to various policies as well as possibly other corrective actions
1022106 the company has already been taking aggressive steps consistent with meeting these requirements
1022107 obviously we are disappointed with the companys second quarter results
1022108 the further deterioration in credit quality we have experienced and the resulting increased allowance for loan losses reflect the slowing of the real estate sectors

1022120 dar este demna politica culturala din romania sa sustina astfel de forme stradale care sunt de fapt avangarda artei sustinerea unor astfel de forme culturale nici macar nu ar trebui sa provoace polemici multi dintre artistii care prefera expresia stradala au scoala de design de arte se gasesc graffiti uri pe zidurile de la pompei ce le face pe acelea sa fie mai emblematice decat cele de astazi din bucuresti absolut nimic doar faptul ca au fost acoperite cu magma si conservate
1022121 este vorba de o anumita perspectiva culturala romaneasca asupra realitatii anume ca empiricul nu conteaza conteaza doar spiritul as aduce aminte vorba lui oscar wilde cine separa corpul de spirit nu are nici una nici alta este reprezentativ ca pe peretii publici ai bucurestiului apar forme foarte frumoase de graffiti si in acelasi timp apar inscrisuri care fac trimiteri sexuale sau corporale este la fel de reprezentativ sau pentru mine mult mai interesant fata de ceea ce se intampla in galeriile curate ale fondului plastic
1022122 nu am vazut expozitia dar m am lovit si eu de o astfel de problema noi romanii avem o obsesie a imaginii noastre in strainatate si asta persista inca din vremea comunismului si vrem tot timpul daca se poate sa facem numai filme despre delta dunarii carpati si vaze si ulcele atata timp cat exista un curator el isi asuma responsabilitatea pentru ceea ce a promovat eu am lucrat cu icr ul din new york si sunt niste oameni foarte profesionisti e ridicol intr un fel caci la new york se intampla un milion de lucruri in fiecare zi si doar cine nu stie ce inseamna cu adevarat new york ul si o piata adevarata poate sa transforme o expozitie de arta intr un scandal de felul acesta dar oricum e un scandal minor
1022123 expozitia nu era nicidecum plina de simboluri de tipul celor pomenite in presa pot sa spun in cunostinta de cauza pentru ca am vazut expozitia imi pare rau sa o spun dar e o aberatie ce se scrie in presa o aberatie care a luat foc nu stiu de ce aici la bucuresti acolo chiar nu e nimic de inflamat artistii respectivi ar trebui sa fie multumiti ca s au facut valuri in jurul lucrarilor lor
1022124 impresia mea este ca cele doua probleme au fost comasate pentru a da o lovitura icr ului icr ul care in sfarsit in ultimii ani face ceva a inceput sa se miste atata timp cat a fost o structura stearpa plina de fosti de toate felurile nimeni nu a zis nimic de ce pentru ca nu se facea nimic si daca nu faci nimic nimeni nu o sa te deranjeze in momentul in care incep sa se intample lucruri apar problemele lumea e critica si mai stiu eu ce totul e din lumea asta si are fata de normal dar asta pana la inflamarea din presa si media romaneasca care nu e normala

1022214 the embryonic climate change business consulting market is set to boom but buyers must beware of untested offerings and gaps in consulting firms expertise
1022215 this combination poses a challenge for new players entering the climate change consulting market
1022216 firms can pick from a multitude of different consultancies attacking the market with different types of expertise and wide variations in consulting day rates
1022217 confusion will increase as more players are poised to launch services
1022218 climate change is changing from an environmental issue into an economic issue as a result managers responsible for implementing climate change programmes seek advisers who combine technical expertise with business advice and financial analysis skills
1022219 despite the backing of strong brand names and investment in new climate change consulting capabilities it and strategy consulting firms have a long way to go to convince sceptical buyers that they are the right partner
1022220 these elements put icf international at the forefront of climate change business consulting
1022221 firms that launched or significantly enhanced their climate change offerings in the last 2 years now have evidence of customer wins
1022222 when i learn something new and it happens every day i feel a little more at home in this universe a little more comfortable in the nest

1022225 weve made a verbal promise to the senior citizens that they will always have a place to hold their lunches
1022226 the strength of a city is measured in its quality of living
1022227 we try to get in guest speakers once a month to talk about senior citizen issues
1022228 all we want is somewhere for the senior citizens to go monday through friday
1022229 a lot of seniors donated their time to build this center
1022230 every big town i know of has a community center
1022231 its important for the elderly on low incomes to be able to buy a gift like spending a nickel to buy a coffee mug
1022232 the workers will be retrenched from an older section of the mine this section has been depleted
1022233 they opted to rather go home than risk their lives there
1022234 i dont want to be married just to be married i cant think of anything lonelier than spending the rest of my life with someone i cant talk to or worse someone i cant be silent with
1022235 the share is falling from the news that came out on friday
1022236 if gold remains above 900 an ounce there may be some bargain hunting coming into the stock

1022257 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1022258 our goal is to just collect taxes it is only as a last resort that we would pursue foreclosure
1022259 theyre trying to take my house away for a parking violation
1022260 i know it was my own fault for letting it drag on ive been under mental duress i havent been able to handle this
1022261 but on the other hand the city has to enforce its zoning laws i dont fault the city for that
1022262 its a shame someone didnt intervene to help him it would be nice if someone who worked for government would take the time and say lets look at this and see if were doing the right thing it would be nice if they would remember the human factor here
1022263 it was a combination of things financial and emotional my caregiving role all heaped themselves on me at the wrong time
1022264 one day in a very bad mood mom told me to get rid of the cars in the driveway right away
1022265 if someone says im dealing with a death were going to be reasonable and give them a 30 day extension
1022266 but 1 475 thats a lot of months mourning not to be insensitive
1022267 if youre telling me we had a mentally anguished individual and that inspectors made no attempts to get at that that can be considered
1022268 there will have to be some serious evidence but if we were deaf to that point i would be willing to reconsider some of those fees
1022269 provided a whole lot of excuses as to why he didnt comply
1022270 theres really not too much that would allow us to reverse those charges
1022271 if you were a criminal wed take care of the whole problem for you get you an attorney
1022272 but if youre involved in civil litigation in jeopardy of losing your house or your family what we do is make you go out and find your own attorney mikeb
1022273 this isnt a religious accommodation this is a contractual agreement the majority asked for it
1022274 mother lets me buy what i wish i shall eat it alone which is fair if i pay for it
1022275 that would be greedy you could never eat so big a loaf alone
1022276 and one need not share what is his own unless he wishes
1022277 and you and i can have one of those wee loaves together they have currants in them so we shall not mind if the loaf is small
1022278 give me my loaf this is mine and give it to me at once do you not see my coin is silver do not keep me waiting
1022279 and did you not choose it yourself and choose to eat it alone do not complain of the loaf since it is your own choosing
1022280 see the lad there with all those children his bread is light give us too light bread and sweet
1022281 as those choose who have no thought in sharing i cannot change your loaves i cannot choose for you had you buying forgotten that mine are thanksgiving loaves i shall come again then you can buy more wisely
1022282 the exact way weve done ae will suit this process
1022283 thats why were saying its a good springboard for the new gtld process
1022284 when we talk about the new gtld space were different from our competition because we have the versatility to offer a set licence fee for our software
1022285 were a small australian company at the moment but wed like to think we can take on the big guys out of the us in the process and hopefully come out the other side as a leader
1022286 we feel like weve cut our teeth on au and the last seven years of running it has been an apprenticeship
1022287 these firms had gone to a lot of trouble to establish really interesting and quite stimulating settings but because in a virtual setting you can see who is in there unlike the internet they knew these spaces were empty of avatars
1022288 commercial firms to date have dipped in and it appears they have dipped out because most of those sites have been shut down
1022289 the actual second life setting is going to require either an adaptation or a new commercial virtual marketplace controlled by commercial parameters that you need for safe and secure business activity to happen on the internet
1022290 the main drivers were the financial aspects of reducing air travel and the environmental aspects of reducing carbon emissions which are important
1022291 also theres the improvement in staff time when you take out the extra costs of hanging around airports and going to and from there its the usual videoconferencing drivers
1022292 the department of human services has three lead portfolio agencies which are centrelink medicare and the child support agency
1022293 human services itself is looking at the opportunity to use the capabilities within each agency and across the other agencies which can work more closely this initiative will contribute to that
1022294 procurement and customer service departments right across the board are looking at all sorts of opportunities to get improve their capabilities
1022295 from time to time government departments and agencies may take advantage of contractual arrangements with suppliers that have been negotiated by other departments and agencies if those arrangements meet their business needs
1022296 in the case of centrelinks contract for videoconferencing services medicare australia has engaged the same services under centrelinks existing contract under these piggybacking provisions
1022297 we are still not clear on the root cause of the problem but we are investigating
1022298 we do know that the problems were related to our new 3g software platform and now we are working with our vendor to understand the underlying issues that caused these three problems
1022299 the appeal decision in the buffalo test case is expected soon
1022300 the buffalo case result is likely to have implications for a number of related cases pending before judge davis in the federal court in the eastern district of texas
1022301 these cases relate to the same us patent owned by the csiro and involve other parties including microsoft intel dell and hewlett packard
1022302 the csiro intends to continue these legal actions with a view to securing an equitable return for use of the technology we developed and any return will be used to fund further scientific research of benefit to australia
1022303 one of our terms of reference is to propose a set of national innovation priorities to lead funding through government programs and for us the it sector is one of our priorities
1022304 clearly it innovation is going to crucial in addressing a lot of the challenges we are facing such as climate change
1022305 none of us expected the huge level of public response to the review the number and range of submissions
1022306 it was more important to get this right than to rush something through to the original timeline and mr carr was in full support of that
1022307 this is a complex project with many elements therefore we are taking our time to make sure we get it right
1022308 like all the large it operations companies we are looking to reduce the number of systems and we will try quite hard to use what we have
1022309 we are certainly looking for systems integration partners as that has worked well for us
1022310 after hearing nothing after about 21 days i went back to the store and was told not to call again until september
1022311 i was happy with this arrangement as i believed it would only be a matter of days before the situation was resolved
1022312 now in only a week and a half my first bill will arrive and i will be paying for a service that ive been unable to use
1022313 i was about to walk away after finding out there was no stock left only to be told by staff that signing up would result in a phone within a matter of days
1022314 in fact i was told i would have my iphone in the next shipment
1022315 im annoyed because i dont know what is going on if they cant deliver a service they should be the ones contacting me
1022316 barack obamas historic candidacy has sparked an unprecedented artistic outpouring
1022317 share their talents and help elect obama at the same time
1022318 you dont have to be picasso you just need to be inspired by barack obama and willing to donate your creativity and time to the cause
1022319 denver will be buzzing during the convention but this gallery is going to be one of the coolest places to visit
1022320 submissions must be about the themes of hope progress change patriotism unity or about barack obama as the exemplar of these themes
1022321 this funding will largely occur in 2009 10 with funding in following years only for new providers
1022322 the pilot will enable the government to collect evidence on the effectiveness of filtering systems in a real world environment and on the potential impacts on network performance and the costs to industry
1022323 generally things are headed in the right direction with this program but a number of questions remain unanswered
1022324 customers already pay us to filter the web for them
1022325 if larger service providers dont offer customised service or adopt a set and forget approach wed have a fair amount of business
1022326 if bigpond offers exactly what i can my business will be in trouble
1022327 in business theres always a threat but im not concerned at this point in time
1022328 either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
1022329 when a man stands between two choices to be killed by his people or to be arrested by his enemy and he reaches a conclusion that it is better to be arrested by his enemy it shows you how cruel the situation is in gaza

1022335 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
1022336 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
1022337 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

1022339 what can you say about the cre transaction slowdown this article points out
1022340 the number of sales are definitely slowing down for a couple of reasons the credit markets are making it difficult to obtain financing many pending sales are taking 2 to 3 times longer to close as well lenders are being far more conservative in their underwriting which is resulting in lower ltvs the cost of capital is increasing as lenders increase their spreads and up front costs and this all results to higher costs for investors and therefore lower return on their investment
1022341 so the costs are up and returns are down how does that affect the behavior of the sellers and buyers
1022342 well that creates a spread between bid and ask price for commercial properties in this new environment sellers are asking too much for their properties and buyers are offering less than before many sellers are realizing they cant get the prices they might have 18 months ago and that now may not be a good time to sell and many of the buyers that were in the market 18 months ago are out the 1031 buyers for example so we are seeing less transactions taking place
1022343 what do you see with regards to sales volumes looking forward
1022344 i think the slowdown is temporary credit markets will come back to more normal conditions and it will gradually become easier to secure financing sellers will eventually come back down to earth over the the rest of this year and in to 2009 we will continue to see slower sales volumes than in the past in the meantime there will still be a small number of distressed sellers who have to sell and will do so at depressed prices a lot of the people we are seeing sell now are in trouble
1022345 what tips would you give our students who are eager to buy
1022346 be patient build your team keep your lead generators going and watch for bargain properties as they show up make sure you only offer what the property can justify based on current income and expect sellers to begin accepting your offers again soon as they get a better understanding of what their property is really worth today i cant tell you how long the slowdown will last no one can and in this market remember a few more very important things when it comes to getting your deal financed use conservative underwriting in your proformas dont expect any more than 75 ltv and write in an extra 30 days extension on your financing period because loans are just taking longer these days
1022347 the department is monitoring the dispute and in the event that this dispute should lead to customers losing access to their service provided under the australian broadband guarantee or its predecessor programs those customers will be entitled to receive a second service under the abg guidelines

1022373 you know where it is and when you do your tillage and other operations you use the autosteer to keep off the drip tape
1022374 farmers know from a lifetime of experience the importance of personal safety on the farm however preparing for visitors and ensuring their safety is a whole different ballgame and requires careful planning and there are many things to consider
1022375 of course every agritourism operator is already thinking of every way possible to make a customers experience safe and happy
1022376 so that the customers dont have to think about it but what if a medical emergency or other crisis occurs while visitors are enjoying time on the farm this workshop will give farmers the understanding and skills they need to do the best thing possible in such a situation as quickly as possible
1022377 its the farmers responsibility to protect visitors to the farm

1022379 usda is committed to fostering a sustainable domestic biofuels industry at home in rural america
1022380 these grants will broaden the sources of energy from many crops as well as improve the efficiency and options among renewable fuels
1022381 cellulosic biofuels offer one of the best near to mid term alternatives we have on the energy production side to reduce reliance and imported oil and cut greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to meet the nations transportation energy needs
1022382 developing cost effective means of producing cellulosic biofuels on a national scale poses major scientific challenges these grants will help in developing the type of transformational breakthroughs needed in basic science to make this happen
1022383 when it first started we sprayed this particular field with glyphosate and we noticed some of the pigweed didnt die these weeds grew in more of an oval than a circular pattern and were scattered seemingly randomly across the field
1022384 for example in a 20 acre field in the early development of glyphosate resistant pigweed we would see two oval shaped patches roughly the size of a pickup truck we conducted our own test in cooperation with our county extension agent
1022385 we sprayed these suspect weeds several times with high rates of glyphosate we knew it wasnt a wash off situation and we knew it wasnt a weather related herbicide problem in short we knew we had a problem
1022386 it has spread throughout our farm but it had to spread by pollen or by continued weed selection for resistance
1022387 currently we have palmer amaranth with resistance to both glyphosate and als inhibitors and in the spring of 2007 we picked up italian ryegrass resistant to accase inhibitors hoelon axial and als inhibitors osprey so far this particular problem seems to be confined to a couple of counties
1022388 we are becoming more concerned with the potential for resistance to ppo inhibitors so far we have none but with widespread use of valor and reflex or other products containing fomesafen it would not be unexpected to find it that would be serious since we depend heavily on ppo inhibitors to help us with glyphosate resistant weeds
1022389 fortunately soybean prices are at a historical high soybean growers as a whole are much more likely to use another herbicide in addition to glyphosate now than in previous years frankly cost does not matter where resistant palmer amaranth is already present you control pigweed regardless of cost or you dont harvest
1022390 cotton prices are nothing to brag about but our growers are using a lot more pre emergence herbicide now than in the past few years again if a grower has resistant palmer pigweed he must get most of it pre emergence or he doesnt get it
1022391 increased use of pre emergence materials is partly the result of us pushing these herbicides but i also think more and more growers are genuinely trying to avoid problems some incentives offered by industry in both cotton and corn this year has also encouraged growers to use more pre emergence or preplant herbicides the combined efforts are working
1022392 lets just say when you go into a field with a cotton picker and you have six foot tall palmer pigweed that are the size of a seedling pine tree at the base youve got serious harvest issues the bottom line is you cant grow cotton soybean or any crop in competition with mature pigweed
1022393 this year we will go with a pint of direx and a pint of reflex broadcast to give us control in the middles before we get to the four or five true leaf stage we will come back with an over the top tank mix application of dual and glyphosate then we will come back with a layby formulation of another family of herbicides
1022394 we want to mix up the families of herbicides as much as possible we have to look at the problem across all crops to avoid over use of any family of herbicides
1022395 in soybeans we have played around with row patterns to try and shade out some of the pigweed we looked at 20 inch rows but have gone back to 30 inch rows so we can strip till we havent seen the pressure from herbicide resistant pigweed in soybeans that weve seen in cotton but it is still a serious issue we could go over the top with more herbicide options than in cotton which is probably why the problem was less in beans
1022396 we are pretty heavy into no till or strip till and that has put pressure on other weed species like horseweed
1022397 even with conventional planting almost no one is cultivating corn soybeans or cotton that puts more reliance on herbicides and hence more selection pressure on weeds
1022398 we have seen cotton acreage drop and corn and soybean acreage increase over the past few years
1022399 so the primary thing our growers are doing to control resistant weeds or to try to avoid getting resistance is to incorporate other modes of action into the system york stresses
1022400 we have glyphosate resistant common ragweed in at least three counties if history teaches us anything we would expect a good chance of resistance in ragweed we are keeping our eyes open for glyphosate resistant lambsquarters and italian ryegrass so far none has been found but those are likely candidates
1022401 as soon as i say this we will probably find resistance in one of these species but as of now we have no resistance in sicklepod and the only resistance in cocklebur has been msma roundup ready cured that and als inhibitors which roundup ready also cured
1022402 we watched resistant horseweed or marestail mushroom in tennessee and arkansas for the past three years i have been warning our growers that it was time to change our ways horseweed has seed that are readily spread long distances by wind it has hit us in a big way this year it is all over eastern north carolina and it is worst in the northeastern part of the state
1022403 in northeastern north carolina some counties have a lot of it my windshield survey indicates it is present in at least 30 percent of the fields in some counties the time has come to assume any horseweed in eastern north carolina is glyphosate resistant and act accordingly

1022414 having lived in buenos aires for the past few years a city with some of the best nightlife in south america i found it frustrating that i couldnt find out about particular types of venues easily for example those that played particular styles of music after much thought and work with my programmer and reviewer we developed buenos aires night guide the complete online guide to bars nightclubs cafes live music restaurants and festivals in buenos aires
1022415 this nightlife guide should be helpful for anyone going out in buenos aires because aside from being able to search by category users can search by the mood theyre in for going out
1022416 these firms had gone to a lot of trouble to establish really interesting and quite stimulating settings but because in a virtual setting you can see who is in there unlike the internet they knew these spaces were empty of avatars
1022417 commercial firms to date have dipped in and it appears they have dipped out because most of those sites have been shut down
1022418 the actual second life setting is going to require either an adaptation or a new commercial virtual marketplace controlled by commercial parameters that you need for safe and secure business activity to happen on the internet

1022503 if we took all the resources in the entire world and divided them up evenly would that end poverty forever
1022504 if we took all the guns away from everybody would that mean that there would never be another murder if people began using knives instead of guns would confiscating the knives end violence forever would taking away every sharp or heavy object and every explosive or poisonous substance end violence and killing

1022509 literature cant merely be an expression of self that would be unbearable
1022510 you have to be critical not just of society and others but of yourself each subject has three pronouns i you and he or she
1022511 if youre not perfectly conscious of yourself that self can be tyrannical in relationship to others anyone can become a tyrant thats why no one can be a superman you have to go beyond yourself with a third eye self awareness because the one thing you cannot flee is yourself thats why greek tragedy is still the tragedy of human beings today

1022531 you watched our show at 2 am again at 7 am and then started but didnt finish it at 3 pm
1022532 you have taxpayers subsidizing the risk takers mortgage lenders which i find unacceptable
1022533 the more i think back the more reasons i think of that i oppose this on
1022534 it actually undoes some of the risk lenders took when they loaned money to these people
1022535 the only way it will cost the taxpayers money will be if the renegotiated mortgages are defaulted on
1022536 as the homes are foreclosed on then no one pays property taxes
1022537 if you dont do this bill to keep homes out of foreclosure the property taxes for everyone else will rise to make up for it the loss of revenue
1022538 my point is theres no loss of taxes under this bill
1022539 while the term bailout has some validity it is not a bailout as in terms of bear stern or even an fdic federal deposit insurance corporation buyout
1022540 the great house is said to be haunted by the ghost of
1022541 judge jeffreys attended many of the hangings in person and his ghost is said to haunt several west country locations as well as his own home at walton on thames
1022542 he is said also to haunt a house in lydford in devon and a house in the centre of dorchester it is said that the sound of choking men rather than the ghost of the judge is heard in some places people have reported the sound of horrific gasping on quiet nights in bath street and the approaches to gore hedge in frome
1022543 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
1022544 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1022548 peter was very up front the day after the election he did the right thing by the party he made his intentions clear and that was that he wasnt available for the leadership of the party

1022551 the majority of operators run professional high quality centres and they have nothing to worry about
1022552 we will continue to work with childcare centres and pre schools to address problems as they arise but if they consistently fail to fix any identified issues then we will take more serious action such as prosecution or revoking operators licences
1022553 these are the key issues thats why well be making sure that anyone who breaks those and faces prosecution when they are prosecuted they will be put on this website
1022554 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be

1022564 we liaised with privacy groups and the government at the very beginning of the project
1022565 we sought and received very detailed privacy advice and analysis even before we started
1022566 its automated because as you can imagine there are tens of millions of images and the images are not rendered with human intervention
1022567 some people may still not want particular imagery they consider to be sensitive to appear so theres a very easy tool to remove it

1022572 ive still got a few concerns with the case they claim they were set up by the police and thats an argument that i think needs independent scrutiny
1022573 im not 100 per cent convinced of the defendants guilt id like to think the police have the right men and my whole family would like to think they have and that everything is tied up
1022574 i cant tell you what the event is about but we want to make sure you have a ticket so you can cover it for the bilerico project we want bilerico project to be there for this one

1022611 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1022612 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1022613 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1022614 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1022615 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1022616 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1022617 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1022618 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1022619 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1022620 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1022621 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1022622 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1022623 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1022624 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1022625 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1022626 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1022627 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1022628 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1022629 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1022630 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1022631 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1022632 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1022633 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1022634 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1022635 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1022636 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1022637 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1022638 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1022639 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1022640 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1022641 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1022642 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1022643 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1022644 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1022645 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1022646 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1022647 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1022648 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1022649 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1022650 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1022651 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1022652 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1022653 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1022654 who are open to doing something on the production side
1022655 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1022656 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1022657 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1022658 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light

1022661 the aim of raw is to keep internal disturbances flaring up and the isi preoccupied so that pakistan can lend no worthwhile resistance to indian designs in the region
1022662 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1022663 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1022664 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge fools despise wisdom and instruction
1022665 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1022666 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1022667 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1022668 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

1022679 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1022680 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

1022726 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1022727 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1022728 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy

1022730 yeah i got my jaw broken two months ago and it hasnt recovered 100 yet so its still a month until i can just wear a visor
1022731 i usually wear a shield but i didnt want to break it again
1022732 it doesnt really change my game its just that you cant really see as clear as you can when you have a visor
1022733 its hard to get used to it when you played four years with just a shield
1022734 but its something i have to get used to for college hockey
1022735 i played last year in ontario and thats where i earned a scholarship to go to clarkson next year
1022736 i have four years to get better maybe less if the bruins want me earlier but i still have a good four years to get in shape
1022737 a couple of our players are pretty good some of them got 160 so i guess there is some hidden talent here

1022739 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1022740 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1022741 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1022742 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1022743 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1022744 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1022745 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1022746 landscapes of literature rambling and reading with the wordsworths and the brontes
1022747 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1022748 replaced at a later date so that we can get oil into the market
1022749 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1022750 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
1022751 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
1022752 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
1022753 its another example of short term political posturing from washington not the long term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil
1022754 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1022755 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1022756 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1022757 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1022758 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1022759 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

1022763 i had used products before during pregnancy that were supposed to diminish my stretch marks and they didnt work so i put clay essentials on my thighs and upper leg area where i had stretch marks from having my last baby even with just three or four applications i noticed those lines looked like they were starting to disappear it also made my skin so much smoother i highly recommend clay essentials to all of those women out there looking for a product that really does improve the look of stretch marks
1022764 ive been in the cosmetic industry for years and im always looking for natural products i was introduced to clay essentials by my son who came over and urged me to try it i decided to give it a shot and to my amazement my skin felt so tight smooth and soft afterwards i was ready to go out on the town i was very impressed i prefer clay essentials to the product i had been using and would recommend it to anybody
1022765 after 10 years in the landscape business you get a lot of sun damage my skin felt like leather i had always thought clay masques were just for women but after trying clay essentials once wow what a difference i really love that my skin feels so soft smooth and fresh the best it has felt in a decade people are already telling me i look five years younger what more could i ask for
1022766 im 55 years old and have had problems with age spots a fter using clay essentials for a couple of weeks im really starting to see them fade ive used the eye amp lip masque as well and ive noticed that the wrinkles on my upper lip are softening and look like theyre disappearing over the years ive spent an awful lot of money on high priced cosmetics especially skin care products but ive found that with clay essentials it doesnt cost as much and im getting better results
1022767 ive had blemishes my entire life from my teenage years into my 40s ive tried every product out there including those expensive regimens but im going to drop the three step program that im currently using because clay essentials is so much easier with this product application is just one quick easy step i can do it at home in a few minutes plus clay essentials didnt leave my skin itchy or irritated like other blemish products ive tried when i took it off my face was bright and my skin felt alive and pretty even without makeup thats a great feeling
1022768 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1022769 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1022770 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1022771 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

1022790 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
1022791 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks for our mission critical applications this experience demonstrates the value companies looking at virtualized recovery solutions can gain by tapping sungards expertise rather than handling internally
1022792 server virtualization will dramatically change the it recovery services model for both the services provider and the customer with replication to a shared storage infrastructure and a virtualized server infrastructure customers can enjoy improved recovery time and recovery point objectives without the cost of dedicated and custom recovery solutions from the dr service provider

1022832 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the u s helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
1022833 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 percent of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 percent of demand continued to show double digit unit growth jpmorgan recently revised upward its forecast for unit sales of personal computers to 13 percent with sharp increases in sales of portable systems forecasts for unit sales growth of mobile handsets range from 10 to 12 percent for 2008
1022834 personal computer unit sales in emerging markets are expected to grow by 19 percent more than double the growth rate in developed markets this year in 2008 developing countries with sales of over 153 million units will account for half of worldwide personal computer sales in mobile phones developing countries are expected to account for 66 percent of total worldwide unit sales of over 1 3 billion up from 61 percent last year the emergence of large middle class populations in china india eastern europe and latin america has more than offset the effects of slower growth in the u s economy we expect that demand for consumer electronic products in these new markets will continue to outpace growth in developed markets for the next several years
1022835 inventory for the industry is in balance with minor excess in a few product sectors
1022836 advances in semiconductor technology continue to deliver huge benefits to consumers as semiconductor devices deliver higher performance and increased functionality at lower cost
1022837 at the same time rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry the cost of 1 gigabit of dram has declined by 43 percent during the past year while the price of 2 gigabits of nand flash has declined by 61 percent in the last 12 months lower prices enable increased memory content in consumer devices micron estimates that the memory content of the average pc will increase at least 50 percent this year while the memory content in the average cell phone will increase by more than 150 percent
1022838 the impact of advanced technology on energy efficiency is even more dramatic
1022839 a recent independent study showed that computers have become nearly 3 million percent more energy efficient over the past 30 years
1022840 were on the water right now just putting on extra lines in case it comes up

1022848 thats interesting but i really dont like to read books that thick
1022849 i read the first chapter or so and kind of got the gist of it
1022850 its about tackling housing rehabilitation one neighborhood at a time
1022851 i grew up in these neighborhoods and the housing revitalization that we see happening in braddock and much of the mon valley is the truest form of change i have seen in many years
1022852 there has been little or no investment of this kind in the mon valley for years and we now see that people dont want to leave these communities if they have good and affordable housing
1022853 we are beginning to see what we have been talking about for years
1022854 the success of what we do depends on the strength of the community groups we work with and their commitment to identifying neighborhoods where we could make an impact
1022855 what we have found is that there are many nice houses in all of these neighborhoods but people often cant see that because of all the blight around them
1022856 we try to tackle such neighborhoods with expansive projects like a 25 house construction that can actually change the look of a neighborhood
1022857 we dont want the blight to spread many times we see neighborhoods which have pretty nice houses but then a few abandoned properties in the same area have the capacity to create other abandoned properties and absentee landlords
1022858 what we see mvi doing in the mon valley is a model of what we want to see happening in other parts of the state
1022859 it is a model of housing redevelopment that i hope places like philadelphia lancaster reading harrisburg and york will adopt
1022860 heres a real nugget for you a tractor with a really bad attitude varmints of the field beware oh by the way it was co spotted by my son emre who as i am sure you will remember spotted the trash can bin you featured a while back please feature his name prominently in the update oh and by the by the way the picture was taken in turkey so it fits nicely in with the radio you featured recently do i smell a theme coming yours pingus
1022861 china has the highest growth rate for pharmaceutical sales than anywhere in the world
1022862 more energy dense foods which have higher saturated fats and calories than vegetables and carbohydrates
1022863 chinese food is usually communal and not individually served so there needs to be two pairs of chopsticks which pair to use well the steel pair is for your personal use ie put food into your mouth the black pair it to take food from the main plates to your own plate or bowl
1022864 we will not be corrected and let us not be reproved
1022865 all men and women are not at the same level christianity is a walk and a process thus the process driven life and we are all all of those who truly belong to christ in different places on the pilgrims progress some have just started their walk and some are farther along than others
1022866 since the above is true then wherever i am and whatever i am doing and whatever i plan is acceptable
1022867 theres no place like home click click theres no place like home
1022868 a lot to think of here there will be a great tendency to balanced
1022869 overall we should pray about this and make sure we dont do anything rash
1022870 christ is using the church to convert and to take authority over the world we must no witness
1022871 the kingdoms of this world are becoming the kingdom of christ hes using our involvement to make the world better
1022872 to tell the christ rejector that god loves him is to cauterise his conscience as well as to afford him a sense of security in his sins
1022873 search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting
1022874 the day is coming when hypocrites will be called to account for all their presumptuous intruding into gospel ordinances and usurpation of gospel privileges take him away those that walk unworthy of christianity forfeit all the happiness they presumptuously claimed our saviour here passes out of the parable into that which it teaches hypocrites go by the light of the gospel itself down to utter darkness
1022875 have more grace and mercy you know like christ did
1022876 then it doesnt matter what i am doing i am in gods will
1022877 well you know god is sovereign wherever you are and whatever you are doing that is gods will for you
1022878 to say that those who are obedient dont have joy is just not true
1022879 you dolts god came to applebees way back in 70 a d you missed him were already in the kingdom satan is bound and the lion is lying down with the lamb all nations have made their swords into ploughshares and the resurrection is past
1022880 can you imagine what it would be like living in the heat without air conditioning running water or electricity
1022881 you could think of ron wayne kind of like the fifth beatle
1022882 he had a strong association with steve jobs and steve wozniak in the beginning but was not a participant in their future success
1022883 interferes with the issue which is who should be elected in november
1022884 now i will be glad as soon as this election is over in january to have this conversation with you and everybody else i have very strong feelings about it
1022885 ive heard it from the press and i will not comment on it there are things i wished i said things i wished i hadnt said but i am not a racist i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack him personally
1022886 a different standard was applied to the finest candidate i ever supported
1022887 he hit her hard a couple times and they hit us a few weeks before she ever responded in kind
1022888 the only thing i ever got mad about people in your line of work pretending that she had started negative stuff its contact sport
1022889 i think everybodys got a right to run for president who qualifies under the constitution and id be the last person to begrudge anybody their ambition
1022890 between michael and jeff they are doing a great job of bringing out what needs to be known how to use it adding the keystrokes on the screen is great and making sure even first time users of lightroom are going to get it
1022891 canon has put considerable effort into correcting and improving eos 1d mark iii autofocus in the 14 months since the cameras was introduced but they have not yet made it or its high resolution counterpart the eos 1ds mark iii deliver reliable autofocus of subjects in motion
1022892 between michael and jeff they are doing a great job of bringing out what needs to be known how to use it adding the keystrokes on the screen is great and making sure even first time users of lightroom are going to get it
1022893 im doing a full circle im coming back to performing after many years of taking a bit of a hiatus
1022894 usually its the other way around im working towards becoming a waiter eventually thats my goal it may sound silly
1022895 its a different form of expression too writing for yourself and its something id always wanted to do theres a lot of risk involved but im having a blast to be honest with you
1022896 americans are only voting for the chance to vote for a black president
1022897 once they get to the general election i think theyll find a 73 year old white republican is just about the kind of change theyre ready for
1022898 i think about that line a lot actually its a little scary
1022899 and its about race and politics am i black enough how black do you need to be
1022900 its called primarily colored and it deals with the politics of authenticity
1022901 not as funny as kennedy hes a little stiffer to me
1022902 politicians i dont trust their sense of humor these days i always feel somebody gave them a joke you know im not saying that didnt happen back then but kennedy certainly was quick
1022903 ive seen obama be quick in certain situations ive seen mccain the same way too hillary clinton i think has an underappreciated sense of humor ive seen her be very funny in off the cuff situations
1022904 i think im coming in to being able to get away with how ive been for a long time
1022905 when i did stand up when i was in my 20s and i had this approach it always worked in stand up but it didnt translate well to television
1022906 so now im very happy that im old enough to have my sense of humor come across
1022907 were living in extraordinary times right now too you know and to have a candidate like mr obama and the fact that the daily show is going to be at the conventions you know its just huge i just feel so fortunate to be able to do it
1022908 to look and feel good dress up in a sharp suit with a serious bit of footwear and headgear and forget all about it once youve left home
1022909 tap into your inner tech nerd and get plugged into innovative music the latest gadgets
1022910 its good to be away from home and have people in front of us
1022911 the most ill have to pay if its totaled is 500
1022912 but the stuntmen are the actual sexy guys on the set so the reaction you expect a movie star to get you often get from a stuntman its real theater
1022913 with stunts its kind of like male choreography its macho dance
1022914 because for many of them their careers start out with a certain disappointment either because they found themselves the best at a sport that has no market or theyve had a crushing injury
1022915 terry leonard had thrown out his back in the canadian football league and so he came in with a sense of mortality even as he did some of the greatest stunts on film hes the one who went under the truck in raiders of the lost ark
1022916 but theyre better because theyve got time to perfect it they call what they do gags and when theyre not doing one on set theyre trying them on each other the film clip of their pranks would be as good as the clips of their stunts
1022917 like much of american industry it was very dangerous carelessly approached haphazard
1022918 people have a vision of the crazy stuntman who drank and was devil may care and did crazy things well half the country was that way everyone was doing a three martini lunch
1022919 theyre more in shape much more serious about it theyre athletes who realized they have to spread out their earning years take care of their bodies

1022924 yasunobu nakamura and jaw shen tsai are outstanding experimental physicists and they were selected from a very strong list of nominations
1022925 they were the first to show that quantum coherence could be displayed in a superconducting device opening the way to a completely new solid state quantum computer architecture and a new regime in which to test quantum mechanics these results had been long sought by physicists and must rank as one of the greatest achievements in physics of recent years nakamura and tsai redefined the research programs of many top research groups worldwide since the first results on this emerged from this group in the late 1990s they have remained leaders in the field and have gone on to provide a number of further very significant results
1022926 demonstrably false a fact that could not have been doubted by any sentient person involved
1022927 we are pleased that yet another court has delved into the workings of this manufactured tax shelter and found it deficient
1022928 we hope that other taxpayers who seek to defend this patently abusive shelter will heed this decision and abandon their efforts to defend the indefensible for our part the department of justice will redouble its efforts to expose and defeat these blatant attempts to raid the treasury

1022940 for women with the most severe burns there is little the hospital can do other than making them comfortable with painkillers and waiting for them to die
1022941 iranian movies that feature self immolation are very popular here they make it look easy the girls think they just have to put petrol on themselves and it will all be over in a second
1022942 we can only measure reported incidents of when women are admitted to hospital but often the families will refuse to take them to hospital because they do not want to bring dishonour on the family and of course if they die no one will know about it it will just be hushed up
1022943 it is not untypical to find a girl an 18 year old girl who has become the second wife of an 80 year old husband
1022944 what sort of a life is that they get beaten by their husband and mistreated by the mother in law and they have no way to talk to their families

1023229 one group of stocks that has always intrigued us are those whose symbols have one letter
1023230 these stocks have been beaten down pretty badly and now look particularly appealing

1023233 management has been quick to react laying off workers and shutting down plants we think the brand is strong enough to survive and so does legendary investor kirk kerkorian who has been buying ford shares as they drop

1023353 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we need to tap the strategic petroleum reserves
1023354 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1023355 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy

1023414 i have a hot key macro that broadcasts jesus loves you please love him back or he will burn you in hell pm me if you want to learn more across four channels i do it right when i log in i usually get pm d private messaged by a few characters who i then add to my buddy list i follow them around the game across snow capped mountains and blasted wastelands until they accept christ or persecute me so wow gold much that i have to report them to the server administrators for making fun of my religion i think i ve been responsible for getting over thirty accounts suspended for bigotry directed at me because of my faith
1023415 i told pastor deacon fred that every single time i find an item that looks like it has something to do with the occult i hop on a griffin and head straight to ironforge where i auction it off christian gamers shouldn t be carrying that stuff around we don t enter places that serve cheap wow gold alcohol in the game either it is just not a good testimony all the money i make from selling occult items to unsaved gamers i auction off on e bay for real cash which i then put into the offering plate at our church on the last sunday of each month
1023416 i evangelized in lineage 2 everquest diablo and a bunch of other games
1023417 but i haven t seen nearly as many people who are as open to hearing the gospel message as i have inside the world of warcraft
1023418 i m also in one of the largest christian guilds on our server
1023419 i think the reason so many people are open to hearing about jesus in the world of warcraft is cheap wow gold because the majority of people who play the game are lonely kids who don t have any friends i doubt any of them play sports so you can pretty much guess that there are lots of gay boys and fat little pale faced wiccan girls on the servers who hate themselves and escape into virtual characters so they don t have to deal with their pathetic lives when they hear that someone loves them even if it is just the lord jesus christ they always want to hear more
1023420 most people who are mean liberal nasty lonely unsaved losers in real life choose to play the horde an evil race of characters in the world of warcraft and people and guilds who are conservative republican and pretty much easier to win to jesus christ with are found in the alliance that s why the real true christians pick the horde to play as characters and start their guilds in horde territory because they like the challenge of sharing christ s message in a perilous lava soaked environment sometimes buy wow gold you have to pester people for weeks before they listen to you i followed some stupid gnome around for 8 hours until he finally told me that he would accept jesus as his personal savior if i would just promise not to contact him anymore now that rocks
1023421 he has a strict policy against letting unsaved people join our group i think he s from alabama in real life in fact he won t even party up with anyone who isn t a christian he s a level 60 priest and gets a lot of respect he can climb right up to the top of the dwarf statue by the gates of stormwind city and start street preaching to the dark elves and they will listen to everything he says he s done conversion duels on multiple servers where he challenges other players to duel with him if he wins they accept jesus christ as their lord and savior if he loses which he never has he will give them 6 pieces of silver
1023422 i m studying to be a missionary at liberty university in lynchburg virginia

1023424 we cannot produce enough corn to depress the price significantly below the level set by the value of corn to ethanol producers if corn prices drop ethanol producers will expand until the corn price increases enough to make further expansion unprofitable
1023425 do not judge so that you will not be judged
1023426 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened for you for everyone who asks receives and the one who seeks finds and to the one who knocks the door will be opened is there anyone among you who if his son asks for bread will give him a stone or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake if you then although you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him in everything treat others as you would want them to treat you for this fulfills the law and the prophets
1023427 i would be upset if the city doesnt come up with a master plan for pipelines and create gathering lines that dont go through neighborhoods the city can do that the neighborhoods must organize and make the city do that and we must have a moratorium on rigs and pipelines until this can be done
1023428 cricket was part of the 1900 olympics when great britain beat france but with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
1023429 over the next century the challenge for all of us who love the game is to spread the word of cricket to parts of the globe that have never heard of it and currently dont play our sport
1023430 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
1023431 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
1023432 is it a realistic dream i really believe it is the icc has already taken the step to become a recognised olympic sport and that is the first step on the road to becoming part of the olympic program
1023433 the olympic movement knows it needs to increase its presence in the asian subcontinent as india pakistan and bangladesh contribute nearly 22 per cent of the worlds population
1023434 with some of these things the technology is so new the concept so bizarre that there would only be a handful of well tapped in athletes using it but they will be experimenting at the beijing olympics because it is the ultimate
1023435 the problem is that some of the drugs would now fly under the radar with the tattoo technique because athletes would be taking a much smaller dose
1023436 these mind clearing drugs have the ability to alter the emotions so athletes would be very attracted to these kind of drugs even though they are only at the very early research stages
1023437 my dreams come true now i was planning to play in japan but maybe now i change my plans and play in america
1023438 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1023439 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1023440 for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club
1023441 obviously i have put in calls to heath and alan to talk to them and theyve got to get back to me so i can talk to them
1023442 when you get a call at seven oclock in the morning all youve got the opportunity to do is get all of those involved into the mix sit down and go what happened
1023443 if theres any dishonesty in the club at any level let alone something as serious as this it is a major issue as a club there was no inference to me that there was anything more sinister attached to that so i only deal with the facts
1023444 knows the ramifications better than anybody else in regards to this thats why it makes it even more bewildering

1023671 she had plenty of money so its not like we had to live like that she just wanted it that way she never wanted us to get caught up in material things
1023672 he had become a little rebellious a little hard to control at times its not like he was a bad kid michelle just thought that living with his father would do him some good
1023673 she said how excited she was that i was coming home and about how glad she was that i was her big brother
1023674 she had this big smile and freckles my mom named her after bob marley you can imagine how cute she was
1023675 he was the only one with keys to certain locks
1023676 people testified that he was planning to do something like that but he still didnt go to jail
1023677 i tried to remember the happy days i spent with them
1023678 but there were so many times when i thought why didnt i change the locks on the house or why didnt i wake up and do something to stop it
1023679 he thought he shouldve been able to save his mother
1023680 we had never had much of a father son relationship
1023681 now all of a sudden i was living with him i was used to being the man of the house and now i had all these strict rules we just never saw eye to eye on things
1023682 you cant hold down a job if you cant listen to authority growing up without me or any kind of a father figure in his life put him at a disadvantage
1023683 that was right after my mom died and i had a short fuse
1023684 its not like i was going around looking for fights but if someone came up and said something to me i didnt think i just acted
1023685 the reason the department of health and welfare stepped in was because they said you can spank your kid but you cant leave a mark
1023686 but how can you spank a kid with a belt and not leave a mark
1023687 hes never been hit hes never been punched hes never been slapped ive given him three spankings in his life and we prayed after each one he had more spankings by his mom than hes had by me hes never been abused
1023688 i dont even think they were trying to be racist or mean
1023689 that was one of the best semesters he ever had in school all as and a b
1023690 he started seeing that football could really take him somewhere and he started to focus
1023691 he had a good thing going here its a shame he couldnt work things out with his father
1023692 he told me that if i wasnt going to live with him i wasnt going to live anywhere in the state of idaho
1023693 hes a good kid but hes had a rough patch
1023694 i made every possible attempt to set him up for success now its up to him we love him were still rooting for him we pray for him every day
1023695 the bottom line is that hugh has an image in his head that hell never get rid of the image of finding his mother
1023696 hes still got a lot of unresolved anger from her death hopefully thats something he can fix
1023697 when he walked through our door a few months ago i thought oh my
1023698 you can take one look at his body and tell that hell be playing on saturdays and maybe sundays too the thing our players will come to realize is that having hugh here will create opportunities for other people
1023699 no one is going to overlook him now there are a lot of big kids out there but the things that set hugh apart are his strength and the way he moves he runs around out there like hes 220 pounds
1023700 he walked up to me stuck out his hand and said i hear youre one of the captains
1023701 you can see that he doesnt have a big ego there may be some people who are still warming up to him but i dont think theres anyone who doesnt respect him
1023702 she was a free spirit who opened her heart up to the whole world
1023703 but the person who did this to them i forgive him ill always be mad at him but i forgive him it hurts me to say that it really does but i dont want to go through life with bitterness anymore i dont want to be an angry person thats not how my mom wouldve wanted me to live
1023704 if youre stuck on the past how can you move forward
1023705 i had been sitting very still to listen to her now becoming more aware of myself i found that i was cold and i drew my coat a little closer about me the action made my note book show at my pocket and i saw her looking at it all the time we talked then her gaze kept returning to that edge of book until at last when i rose to leave her she said why did i always carry a book with me did i mean to write about the women of the gaol i told her then that i take my note book with me wherever i go that it was a habit i had fallen into when helping my father with his work i said i should feel very strange without it and that what i wrote in it i sometimes later put into another book that was my diary i said that that book was like my dearest friend i told it all my closest thoughts and it kept them secret she nodded my book was like her she said it had no one to tell i might as well say my closest thoughts there in her cell who did she have to pass them on to

1023777 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1023778 that the credit crisis was gods fault rather than the doing of the bankers and the rating agencies and the governments snoozing watchdogs
1023779 we want the accursed foreclosure system wiped out we will stand by our homes and stay by our firesides by force if necessary
1023780 two families protected their apartments by shooting their landlord and were acquitted by a sympathetic jury
1023781 all the people we talked to had considered suicide at least once
1023782 describing clients who showed up at their offices with cyanide or threatened if you dont help me ive got a gun in my car

1023784 at the same time many cash strapped americans are increasingly frustrated by higher ticket prices baggage fees airport delays and canceled flights that they are simply forgoing vacations that require air travel and staying closer to home
1023785 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1023786 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
1023787 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
1023788 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1023789 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
1023790 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
1023791 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
1023792 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
1023793 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
1023794 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1023795 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1023796 we will have one soldier for every 10 municipalities doing nothing except going to the bar with a policeman its a joke and to cap it all its only a provisional measure
1023797 i have gone to prison because i did not want to reveal the existence of this super secret organization and now andreotti comes along and tells it to parliament
1023798 you had to attack civilians the people women children innocent people unknown people far removed from any political game
1023799 the reason was quite simple they were supposed to force these people the italian public to turn to the state to ask for greater security this is the political logic that lies behind all the massacres and the bombings which remain unpunished because the state cannot convict itself or declare itself responsible for what happened
1023800 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1023801 but some of them will stay in the hospital for observation

1023904 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
1023905 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks for our mission critical applications this experience demonstrates the value companies looking at virtualized recovery solutions can gain by tapping sungards expertise rather than handling internally
1023906 server virtualization will dramatically change the it recovery services model for both the services provider and the customer with replication to a shared storage infrastructure and a virtualized server infrastructure customers can enjoy improved recovery time and recovery point objectives without the cost of dedicated and custom recovery solutions from the dr service provider
1023907 the achilles heel of most virtualized it environments is that they rely on a single data center to facilitate system failover should an event occur
1023908 a recovery strategy with no off site data may mean quite possibly no recovery virtual server replication services provides organizations an affordable way to have access to a secondary data center for protection of physical and virtual it environments

1023913 i want to exonerate the minister it is purely an adamu idea he must have sold the idea to the minister through other people he wants to set up gimba
1023914 adamu is not credible enough to speak about corruption in our league
1023915 i heard that they have indicted some referees for taking bribe if it is true anyone who did that should resign immediately because the giver of bribe knows the taker so also the taker knows the giver
1023916 is it not the same league which produced enyimba football club who won the league a couple of times and went on to win the african champions league twice that they are discrediting now does their assessment agree with caf as a fair body which crowned enyimba african champions two times this same enyimba which came out from a corrupt league won the african title under adamus tenure
1023917 this probe is a cover up for one man to perpetuate himself in power the committee will go after those he adamu sees as enemies in the league board it is going to be stage managed to ease out the league board when you say there is fraud i find it unbelievable that adamu could talk about fraud

1023919 our administrators are not looking inwards to discover these talents before we were looking inwards and our athletes were discovered from school sports but for 15 to 20 years now efforts are geared only towards foreign based athletes all at the expense of development of the talents at home
1023920 what obtains now is short cut to success as administrators now concentrate on sandwich programme no more long term programme which is less expensive it cost more to have the services of foreign based athletes as soon as one competition ends they go to sleep waiting for the next one because they get ready money from the government
1023921 and well get you to that just as soon as leonard hits into a 6 4 3 double play

1023926 it is true that he left football administration a long time ago and might have lost touch but some information seeking here and there could help make the difference in what he feeds the reading public

1023931 it doesnt matter where the 2020 olympic games are held but many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the games
1023932 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
1023933 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
1023934 between 2009 and 2013 cricket would promote itself to the ioc as a prospective sport and if we get it right cricket will be invited to the olympic party in 2020
1023935 they would be investing in the future of the sport because by having a mens and womens competition at the olympic games many more countries would be drawn to cricket
1023936 it wouldnt surprise me if countries like the usa china italy france and japan become competitive very quickly in twenty20 especially in womens twenty20 i believe that in time the success of cricket at the olympic games will lead to more test playing nations something that the sport will need in the coming century
1023937 the olympic movement knows it needs to increase its presence in the asian subcontinent as india pakistan and bangladesh contribute nearly 22 of the worlds population in theory this is a win win for the olympic movement and the icc and its members

1023956 that foreign clubs came to play in nigeria shows that the federation wants to work with the private sector it is a good sign for our football development it shows that nigeria is peaceful and hospitable the message i am sending to the world now is that whether private orgnaisations clubs and even countries should come to nigeria and invest in football the country is peaceful the enabling environment has been provided by the government and nigeria is blessed with abundant talents that could be tapped

1024119 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
1024120 when the napalm hit our village many people were still sleeping in their homes
1024121 those who survived the flames ran to the tidal flats we were trying to show the american pilots that we were civilians but they strafed us women and children
1024122 when the napalm hit our village many people were still sleeping in their homes
1024123 those who survived the flames ran to the tidal flats we were trying to show the american pilots that we were civilians but they strafed us women and children
1024124 we should not ignore or conceal the deaths of unarmed civilians that resulted not from the mistakes of a few soldiers but from systematic aerial bombing and strafing
1024125 history teaches us that we need an alliance but that alliance should be based on humanitarian principles
1024126 we thank the american troops for saving our country from communism for the peace and prosperity we have today
1024127 does that mean we have to shut up about what happened to our families
1024128 the mission was to saturate the area so thoroughly with napalm that all installations on that area would be burned
1024129 but the flashes observed on the ground indicated the intensity of the fire to be accurate enough to destroy any about
1024130 methodical destruction of dwellings and other buildings forward of front lines which are or susceptible of being utilized by the enemy for shelter
1024131 methodical burning out poor farmers when no enemy is present is against the grain of u s soldiers
1024132 when the napalm hit the entrance the blast and smoke knocked out kerosene and castor oil lamps we had in the cave
1024133 it was a pitch black chaos people shouting for each other stampeding choking some said we should crawl in deeper covering our faces with wet cloth some said we should rush out through the blaze those who were not burned to death suffocated
1024134 the americans pushed us back toward the enemy area and then bombed us
1024135 if you say these killings were not deliberate and were mistakes how can you explain the fact that there were so many of these incidents
1024136 we consider macarthur a hero to our country but no one can know the suffering our family endured
1024137 both governments emphasize the alliance but they never care about people like us who were sacrificed in the name of alliance

1024139 bonuses do not have a place in the police service
1024140 sometimes what officers have to do can be awful i was a senior investigating officer in london i have seen the most grisly things you could ever come across but that is the job i signed up to do
1024141 bonuses do not lead to improved performance our high performance has come from work we would have done anyway
1024142 we are fighting for the best pay deal possible and not to have officers reliant on ad hoc bonuses
1024143 this seems to be an extraordinary amount of money to give in bonuses at a time when there is apparently not enough money to honour even the basic police pay settlement
1024144 with some forces clearly struggling to protect the public adequately there are serious questions to be asked about why so many bonuses are being paid out across the board
1024145 we are committed to reviewing the bonus scheme in order to understand if and how it improves performance
1024146 the effect i hope to achieve is to get greater compliance
1024147 would see that others got this and that might be an incentive

1024152 while moodys overall assessment is that the current constellation of risks is captured in the prevailing stable outlook downside pressures could emerge
1024153 first they could involve deteriorations in the governments general debt metrics and its access to external liquidity given the intensified commodity price shocks and an inadequate fiscal response
1024154 policy as well as market interest rates could rise and a sharp deceleration in growth may follow

1024159 the attack on the indian embassy in kabul was an attack on the friendship between india and afghanistan president hamid karzais presence today conveys a befitting response to that attack
1024160 determination to fight terrorism unitedly and with all the forces at their command
1024161 together india and afghanistan are facing the challenges of terrorism of cold blooded brutal murderous activity in our two countries

1024180 us military occupation forces in iraq suffered at least 108 combat casualties in the week ending may 6 as the official casualty total reached at least 65 500
1024181 the actual total is over 85 000 because the pentagon chooses not to count as iraq casualties the approximately 20 000 casualties discovered only after they returned from iraq mainly brain trauma from explosions
1024182 i sell foodstuffs sometimes the occupying powers or their associates come to my establishment may i sell them foodstuffs
1024183 the grand ayatollah has reiterated that he would not allow iraq to sign such a deal with the us occupiers as long as he was alive a source close to ayatollah sistani said the source added the grand ayatollah had voiced his strong objection to the deal during a meeting with prime minister nouri al maliki in the holy city of najaf on thursday
1024184 the very people who suffer most from free trade are often paradoxically among its biggest beneficiaries the reason for this is simple free trade with poorer countries has a huge positive impact on the buying power of middle and lower income consumers
1024185 free trade affects relative prices not the price level the latter being the province of macro and monetary factors
1024186 the sistani fatwa if it is true is really the end of us military occupation in iraq it not only displays the intrinsic cultural divide between us iraq but also perhaps the indignity of foreign military occupation of an arab land

1024221 at best youre looking at five years or more down the road and even the most optimistic assumptions indicate that offshore drilling might reduce the overall world price of oil by a few cents
1024222 we can do this in ways that are consistent with sensible standards of environmental protection
1024223 i dont think its our optimal energy source because we havent figured out how to store the waste safely or recycle the waste
1024224 if were looking for a vast supply of reliable and low cost electricity with zero carbon emissions and long term stability thats the working definition of nuclear energy
1024225 lets give low income americans a break for the summer and realize maybe they deserve it given the increase in food costs given the increase in the cost of gasoline given the increase in expenses particularly when most of them are on fixed income or even worse having lost their jobs
1024226 for some months we have been communicating to customers the message that as well as being a cheaper alternative we can lower their carbon footprint
1024227 for a long time the railroads have been able to claim they are more efficient but the fact they produce fewer emissions as well is a formidable marketing tool
1024228 the carbon footprint issue is frosting on the cake for the railroads
1024229 in the course of just a few years environmentalism has become mainstream
1024230 reducing carbon footprints and emissions has gone from a fringe element to a major topic of discussion
1024231 but there is a lot more they could do lower their footprint even further
1024232 there is plenty of room to reduce idling and they could invest more in engines with lower emissions
1024233 but to be fair that is a part of a much broader national energy debate
1024234 in the past shippers have been reluctant to move freight to trains from the highway because they are slower and less reliable
1024235 but the price differential is now so wide that they are reexamining trains as an option
1024236 for decades we have tried to ship as many packages as we can by rail as long as that allows us to meet our service commitments

1024245 john mccain doesnt have a racist bone in his body
1024246 and theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1024247 he is living off celebrity not ideas and one of the campaign issues is credibility
1024248 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea that he was going to be a victim of his name and his race is a lie
1024249 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it

1024276 this new tool offers a google maps like view of integrative genomic data
1024277 it brings together different kinds of genomic data into a single holistic view im incredibly proud of our computational scientists for responding so rapidly and effectively to the critical needs of the growing genomics research community
1024278 other tools offer detailed localized views of genomic data and a few tools are equipped to provide a whole genome view
1024279 igv was designed to integrate both and to provide smooth zooming and panning across all resolution scales
1024280 most visualization tools are limited in their ability to handle multiple types of genomic data and are typically retrofitted to accommodate new data types as they have arisen
1024281 igv was designed from the ground up to integrate all of these data and to provide a strong platform for future growth and refinement
1024282 before i was introduced to igv i had to use three different programs to visually integrate my data
1024283 but now this one universal browser allows me to rapidly scan the entire genome and identify promising regions which has revolutionized my work
1024284 this tool is designed to enable researchers to view many types of genomic data especially those relevant to human disease

1024366 obama refers to big oil and the need to reduce our use of oil by 35 over the next twenty years how do we get there keep inflating those tires folks
1024367 it seems to me the only thing obama wants us to do is inflate tires
1024368 barack obama stood up at a speech recently and said that one of the things that is really important from energy policy from his standpoint is to check the pressure in our tires so heres a tire gauge and you can go out in the parking lot here and check your tires now thats an interesting thing we want you to have good pressure in your tires you know it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency but checking the air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for the united states of america

1024427 in some models weve lopped off more than 150 watts in energy consumption

1024434 marlin is not a fish that is easily available in rocky point sometimes when the fishermen here fish for sharks marlin gets stuck in the nets thats when i can buy it locally otherwise i have to get it from places further south
1024435 incap has a contract on taj mahal and already went through the zoning process to remove it
1024436 it can only be good for us its our demographic and its great for neighborhood revitalization he told us it would be about eight months before the taj mahal was torn down
1024437 when the police station was here it seemed to be a lot better but since its been gone there have been a lot more incidents
1024438 we wanted to stay in the area and thought it was a good spot
1024439 if you do frac youve forfeited your right to capture
1024440 in the barnett shale you have to frac the shale in order to cause it to produce
1024441 does the rule of capture apply and should it apply when youre dealing with hydraulic fracturing
1024442 its a good question im just not sure theres any answer to it
1024443 we have production left in this state that will not be obtained without fracturing
1024444 everybody agrees that fracturing is absolutely necessary to recover the lions share of the oil and gas production that is left in this state as a matter of public policy we should encourage fracturing not penalize it
1024445 we believe there is clear and convincing evidence here that coastal knew it was going to be draining reserves from under the garzas property into their 100 percent owned coastal fee no 1 well
1024446 and that fair minded and reasonable jurors could conclude that that there was a trespass
1024447 there is a tremendous amount of money involved and if the answer is the rule of capture does not apply
1024448 sometimes things you dream as a child happens so fast like a light and you just cannot believe it
1024449 i am so grateful for the support of lyn i love the club and i leave with their blessings
1024450 now i want to prove myself in the italian league that i have only seen on television
1024451 ive been waiting for this opportunity all my life i want to repay the club back with my performance
1024452 i am so grateful just to be considered i love the challenge they posses and i did not think twice once they came into the picture
1024453 i came to lyn as nobody but now god has given me the chance to play in the italian league as somebody it is one of those dreams you never feel was going to happen
1024454 i want to be able to offer an expert opinion to customers
1024455 things like soils samples and matching cool colors with cool colors and choosing the right landscaping surrounding the pool those are the reasons people recommend me
1024456 and its not just that those who know me know that i am constantly reading and learning about this industry
1024457 the architecture of the pool has to match the house
1024458 thats something i am always looking at in every stage of the design
1024459 no 1 is you have to start with a good plan
1024460 good engineering a soils test you have to rely on the correct information and do whatever the engineer told you to do theres no room for mistakes in high end construction
1024461 everything from digging the hole to tying the steel to the tile work and all the special features it was quality
1024462 its basically one hand held control that turns everything on and off
1024463 hes an example of someone who would probably never have made it over to dallas for a consultation
1024464 a lot of patients i try to send him wont go
1024465 that defines the success of the transplant so within a month you know if its a success
1024466 we try to share our expertise and let the patient go home because thats what they want but then keep tabs on them because we have to keep them safe
1024467 once they see were talking back and forth i think theyre reassured by that
1024468 the initial prototype route were looking at is where theres housing density where theres activity
1024469 may very well be in the cultural district where we have 7 million visitors or downtown where we have the convention center
1024470 every time anyone puts a streetcar in people do higher intensity housing because people can walk out their front door and not have to use their car and they will use the streetcars
1024471 would facilitate circulation within the central city by connecting mixed use districts to each other through downtown
1024472 so downtown is where we expect to be the central point i think we obviously want to consider places that would generate ridership immediately but we also want to consider places where access to rail transportation could include desirable development
1024473 in other cases it may take time before the property is economically ready for redevelopment
1024474 ultimately the market the real estate market will determine where and when development occurs
1024475 i was on that task force and we whittled the number of disinvested areas down to about 13 or so and what we found was almost all of these areas were at one time connected to the original old streetcar
1024476 if you think about it people are returning to the center city because of the cost of gas and because they spend so much time sitting in traffic
1024477 were looking at these disinvested areas and these are concentrations where theres already police fire and even libraries to support development
1024478 on the name concussion we thought about yanez amp wallach but we did not want to be confused with a law or accounting firm
1024479 we wanted to stand out concussion means high impact a kick in the head
1024480 we wanted to lead by example how can we influence our clients to take calculated risks if we dont do it ourselves its a war for eyeballs out there so we wanted a name and screaming orange identity to make ourselves known i cant tell you how many new potential clients call and say what the hell is concussion love it or hate you have to admit you wont forget our name
1024481 concussion isnt a fort worth agency rather we are a national agency that is based in fort worth we have grown at an exponential rate over the past seven years by being smart feisty and nimble often against larger more formidable agencies
1024482 my business philosophy is do right and fear no man it all revolves around competency and high ethical standards add in passion and follow through and its an unbeatable combination
1024483 we have an internal mantra at concussion die trying its part of our culture of work hard play hard attack everything you do to the best of your ability and dont take crap from anyone
1024484 treat others the way we you wish to be treated hire smart great people around you in the creative business there is a lot of ego i think we learn to control ego in our office and if there is a better advertising solution then by god lets find it
1024485 one of the things that is really highlighted this year in the budget is the cost of our employees and our employee benefits
1024486 i think whats different in the last couple of years is were finally starting to figure out what the total cost of our employees are it really puts a lot of pressure on us to figure out how to do all the things we need to do at the city with an emphasis on doing it with as few employees as we can
1024487 the benefit for the citizen is that should make government easier to deal with
1024488 if we can reduce the number of overall departments its simpler to walk into city hall and figure out where you need to go to get your problems solved
1024489 the council has lowered our tax rate in order to give some relief to tax payers but were still a growing city so weve had to continue to meet the services in order to provide the capital infrastructure roads and bridges in order to move people around so it creates even more of a challenge
1024490 some of our expenditures are things like gasoline for example when it skyrockets it puts a lot of pressure on our citizens and gasoline is really a big part of the work that we do so as our costs go up so do our expenditures and the revenues arent always coming in to cover those
1024491 our reserve requirement that the council has designated by policy were not meeting it so we have that shortfall and then all the needs we have that need to get funded have to be funded within the estimated revenues were trying to look at the estimated revenues over three to five years
1024492 depends on when you sort of take a snapshot if you take a snapshot for one year its one number or two years its another number and the further out you go really the bigger that number gets
1024493 its important that we make decisions that recognize that so that were not in this constant churning of thinking we thought we balanced the budget and next year we have another problem
1024494 no offense mom but this is better than your ice cream cones
1024495 no offense dad but that ice cream cone you made me last night was pretty bad

1024499 i am deeply honored to merit a link from solomon who lives up to the venerated ancient name with his wisdom and sagacity
1024500 i have seen your blog liked what youre doing and am linking it weve gone through a similar transformation
1024501 was designed to be an entertaining travelogue through countries formerly behind the iron curtain the programme makers still had a responsibility to be accurate when presenting the facts
1024502 this was particularly important when stating facts about a recent historic event such as the wars of the former republic of yugoslavia which were a matter of political controversy
1024503 the comment on the destruction of the mostar bridge in which it was stated that there was no reason for the destruction was inaccurate
1024504 at the moment the team reached the top a piece of ice broke off in the bottleneck a narrow steep and icy part of the route the ice knocked down the fixed ropes which would have been used for the descent so when the team got there they found they had no safety ropes
1024505 during the descent through the bottleneck a number of people slipped and disappeared into the depths luckily others including wilco managed to get through safely
1024506 van rooijen told us by satellite phone that he was descending along the south wall he sounded disorientated by the long period at altitude and by exhaustion he finally made it to camp three on his own some way further down the mountain the people looking for him van de gevel and pemba ed found him at camp three suffering from frostbite
1024507 as with all unsolved murders this case remains open and subject to review
1024508 this investigation has been subject to numerous reviews and assessments since 1999 by the mets internal review group the crown prosecution service criminal case review commission two senior independent treasury council and the court of appeal
1024509 this remains a met police investigation officers from the homicide command from the specialist crime directorate led by commander simon foy will today begin the process of further assessment and scrutiny of the available evidence to establish whether there are further potential investigative leads in this case
1024510 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
1024511 i will maintain that i will look anyone in the eye and state i have not killed jill dando
1024512 is pretty mysterious for those who do not work there
1024513 the gchq i first knew was very much a cold war organisation
1024514 we were very hierarchical with a rather rigid structure and limited internal communications this is not a criticism the work we did during that period was excellent and our response to crises such as the falklands war could be first class
1024515 but by the 1990s it became clear that a different approach was needed for a very different world with volatile and global threats and the arrival of the internet
1024516 the cold war focus was on the soviet union now our biggest area of work by far is our contribution to counter terrorism
1024517 and support to deployed british forces has become a major activity

1024522 we use different polling methods these days we now use e mail rather than the telephone to reach people on the phone people are more likely to give a socially acceptable answer
1024523 we have noticed a growth in private actions other polls have shown that people are extremely sympathetic towards private aid actions as generally more tangible visible and concrete people are quicker to criticise the government
1024524 information campaigns about aids for instance do not score as well because it is often difficult to make it clear how much further infection has been prevented
1024525 its a strange sort of argument to say you have to stir up the discussion about development aid it implies in some way that it wouldnt happen otherwise there is a great deal of discussion about development aid we dont need the ncdo for that
1024526 the sandbar cantina will be the premier local venue to catch the game no matter what the sport

1024530 i would try not to call him that at school
1024531 i can see him in heaven right now saying oh my god how embarrassing
1024532 the fact that it was not the family but a neighbor who made the suggestion the fact that it was another neighborhood the street is technically in another neighborhood that approved the plan those things make it more special
1024533 we raised our kids to make a difference hes still making a difference
1024534 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
1024535 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
1024536 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
1024537 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people older than 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
1024538 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
1024539 we know that elderly people do not form sufficient antibodies to certain vaccines the flu vaccine included
1024540 in addition people in their 70s and 80s and 90s are more prone to pneumonia with or without influence a number of these pneumonias may be secondary to other causes aside from influenza
1024541 having many people vaccinated builds up a herd immunity to disease and you create barriers to transmission
1024542 we give the flu shot primarily to prevent elderly deaths
1024543 in the best years the flu vaccine is really only 40 to 60 percent effective
1024544 there are plenty of flu related complications that are life threatening besides pneumonia

1024560 pride is important because it helps not only to raise awareness around all that is good about a diverse and fascinating community but also plays a real part in educating a minority who still feel that homophobic biphobic and transphobic behaviour is acceptable
1024561 i am delighted to have taken part in this years pride this is a significant event for the city and it is wonderful to be a part of it
1024562 yet again people have attended in their thousands to line the streets and take part in the pride celebrations
1024563 it has been a peaceful and successful event with very few isolated incidents id like to thank all the organisers and participants for making the event such a great success
1024564 there are many clergy in britain who are living with their partners
1024565 many are out to their congregation and out to their bishop
1024566 but no one is willing to say it out loud
1024567 im here because i would like to make it possible for those who would like to be open and honest to do so
1024568 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board

1024571 those who claim to make a plain reading of scriptures are actually interpreting it as well we all interpret scripture
1024572 it was not very long ago about 150 years we were still using scripture to justify slavery and we came to understand that it was not gods will
1024573 it is very refreshing that the scottish church has always admitted to its inclusiveness
1024574 the english church may claim inclusiveness but it is not always in practice
1024575 it is going to end with the full inclusion of all gods people in gods church
1024576 what a dangerous thing it is to put the bible into the hands of repressed people
1024577 they might read it and believe it they gave it to black slaves to make them docile but they read it and became educated
1024578 who knows who theyll give it to next but god will keep giving it to people too until theres no more them only us

1024585 got clues suggesting that the east turkestan islamic movement planned to make terrorist attacks during aug 1 8 just ahead of the opening of the olympic games in beijing
1024586 ahead of the olympics it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high

1024597 arizona will be offering its citizens a comparatively inexpensive and convenient option to satisfy this new border crossing requirement

1024600 i value the governors leadership in making arizona licenses more secure
1024601 america knows too well how dangerous unsecured licenses can be the public is way ahead of government when it comes to secure identification they want protection from identity theft and they want greater facilitation of lawful trade and travel agreements like this one and the others before it move secure identification in the right direction and i urge other states to do the same
1024602 arizonans deal every day with the many complex issues surrounding border security and immigration
1024603 i believe this enhanced identification will be a useful tool it is my hope that the partnership with the secretary and the agency will support work on this new project throughout the process of its development
1024604 in an effort to reach out to potential buyers sandy beach resorts where prices on residences range from 210 000 to 5 million is offering two incentives programs the first amounts to a complimentary educational seminar where prospective owners are treated to a multi media presentation about the area and resort and legal and financial advice on purchasing property in mexico over a catered breakfast or lunch the second geared towards seminar attendees is a mini vacation to the location itself which includes round trip airfare from los angeles a two night stay in one of sandy beachs beachfront resort meals area tours and activities like a yacht cruise and parasailing

1024607 rarely in modern times has one man s voice provoked the western world to an experience of profound soul searching
1024608 the western world has lost its civic courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations
1024609 the human soul longs for things higher warmer and purer than those offered by today s mass living habits exemplified by the revolting invasion of publicity by tv stupor and by intolerable music
1024610 what we say must be true because were on the left what you say is not because youre not
1024611 we do not take this decision lightly the legal implications are very serious we may be arrested and jailed for our determination to be at the camp
1024612 scientists tell us that from this week we have just 100 months to solve climate change thats not long from this moment every week counts
1024613 it has been going really well and since around 6am weve been sitting in front of police explaining the dangers of climate change
1024614 we have had several things confiscated from us but are determined to make our point and get on with the activities we have planned
1024615 we intend to get into the power station to do whatever we can to stop it operating that day we want to send a very strong message to say new coal is absolute madness and we simply wont allow it
1024616 our main concerns are that coal fired powered stations are worse in terms of co2 production even than oil or gas fired power stations
1024617 it would symbolically be very unfortunate if the uk were to approve a coal fired power station without imposing very strict requirements that some technology should be adopted that would allow it to capture the carbon dioxide it emits
1024618 if we assume that no other coal is to go ahead what will happen is youll have to buy more gas
1024619 the price of gas has an effect on wholesale electricity so if you have 80 of electricity generated from gas its a fair bet the price would go up
1024620 realistically coal is going to be part of the global energy mix for the next 50 years

1024635 of all the packaged economic impact programs this is probably the most highly regarded and probably the most widely used

1024648 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem

1024667 everyone is suffering on costs and in many cases organic farmers have the option to operate at a higher profit elsewhere

1024717 the legislature in its wisdom has limited the period for medically terminating pregnancy
1024718 it is not mere desire to medically terminate pregnancy that will empower woman to abort or doctors to assist abortion there has to be a confirmed opinion of experts and undoubtedly opinion has to be on account of danger to the womans life

1024721 a matter of shame for the country and for the indian government
1024722 it looked like a cabinet committee on forgery and fabrication had lent its shoulders to it the fake sting

1024727 dhoni has been declared the recipient of the rajiv gandhi khel ratna award the countrys most prestigious sports award
1024728 he has represented the country with distinction and deserves the honour
1024729 his exemplary leadership and demeanour under pressure especially in the icc world twenty20 and the tri series in australia mark him out as the ideal role model for millions of young indians who want to make a mark in life
1024730 on two occasions we felt let down when rahul dravid didnt get khel ratna and yuvraj singh was denied arjuna dravid was in good form we had won 16 odis on the trot and the team was on a high still he did not get the award
1024731 yuvraj too was unlucky not to get arjuna after two years of consistent performance we are happy dhoni got it

1024744 im curious as to why there is no discussion of the value of anti trust laws
1024745 gay political story of 2008 there always is id rather be pro active this time
1024746 if obama picks nunn as his running mate it will cause widespread disillusionment with gay democrats and independents it is crucial to remember that supporters are more pro obama than anti mccain choosing nunn diminishes this palpable excitement and looks like politics as usual opening a door for mccain to increase his share of the glbt vote if obama picks nunn while at the same time mccain picks a moderate vp candidate i estimate that the gay vote for mccain will hover between 35 40 it is key that obama avoid falling into this trap if mccain picks a huckabee romney type however it would neutralize this advantage
1024747 it appears the mccain people are so frustrated with obamas star appeal and their sense that he is harder to criticize that theyve made the judgment they have to somehow tarnish him rough him up so that he doesnt look so great even at the risk of making mccain himself look not so great
1024748 i dont think its very pretty i hope it doesnt work but i think theyve made a professional judgment that in order to win this is what they have to do

1024752 they will want that number when talking to fema they will need to keep the number safe and secure when it is time for the property to be inspected the inspector will know the number that is part of the identification process
1024753 if anyone asks for money and says they are from the government they are a fraud
1024754 if someone gets a letter of denial that probably means something is wrong with the application
1024755 it may be that not all the insurance information is there or the title to the property is not clear there will be instructions of what to do to correct the packet the appeal process will also be spelled out

1024872 you have taxpayers subsidizing the risk takers mortgage lenders which i find unacceptable
1024873 the more i think back the more reasons i think of that i oppose this on
1024874 it actually undoes some of the risk lenders took when they loaned money to these people
1024875 the only way it will cost the taxpayers money will be if the renegotiated mortgages are defaulted on
1024876 as the homes are foreclosed on then no one pays property taxes
1024877 if you dont do this bill to keep homes out of foreclosure the property taxes for everyone else will rise to make up for it the loss of revenue
1024878 my point is theres no loss of taxes under this bill

1024940 in this moment of prayer i would like to gather here at the tomb of the doctor gratiae a significant message for the journey of the church
1024941 this message comes to us from the encounter between the word of god and the personal experience of the great bishop of hippo jesus christ the incarnate word is the revelation of the face of god love to all human beings as they travel along the paths of time towards eternity
1024942 the central nucleus of christianity the light of this love opened augustines eyes and brought him to encounter the beauty ever ancient and ever new in which alone the human heart finds peace
1024943 i would like once again to consign ideally to the church and to the world my first encyclical which contains this central message of the gospel deus caritas est god is love
1024944 greatly indebted to the thought of st augustine who was enamoured of the love of god
1024945 in the wake of the teachings of vatican council ii and of my venerated predecessors i am convinced that contemporary humanity has need of this essential message here everything must begin and here everything must lead all pastoral activity and all theological treatises
1024946 love is the heart of church life and of her pastoral activity only those who have a personal experience of the lords love are able to exercise the task of guiding and accompanying others on the road of following christ following christ is above all a question of love
1024947 may your membership of the church and your apostolate always stand out for their freedom from any kind of personal interest and for their unreserved adhesion to christs love young people in particular need to receive the announcement of freedom and joy the secret of which is in christ he is the most authentic response to the expectations of their hearts which are troubled by the many questions they carry within
1024948 following the footsteps of st augustine you too must be a church that frankly announces the good news of christ the church is not simply an organization for collective expression nor at the other extreme is she the sum of individuals living a private religion the church is a community of people who believe in the god of jesus christ and commit themselves to living in the world the commandment of love that he left us
1024949 to pursue the exalted degree of christian life which considers charity as the bond of perfection and which must also be translated into a form of moral life inspired by the gospel
1024950 the innovation nation white paper published earlier this year sets out the governments goal to make the the best place in the world to run a creative innovative business we live in a world where open innovation the exchange of ideas knowledge and intellectual property is becoming the way in which businesses develop and build new products

1024952 why does one want to walk wings why force ones body from a plane to make a parachute jump why should man want to fly at all people often ask these questions but what civilization was not founded on adventure and how long could one exist without it some answer the attainment of knowledge some say wealth or power is sufficient cause believe the risks i take are justified by the sheer love of the life i lead

1024955 a total commitment is paramount to reaching the ultimate in performance
1024956 the task of promoting vocations should increasingly express a joint commitment of the whole church
1024957 every vocation is a personal and unique event but also a community and ecclesial event no one is called to walk alone every vocation is raised up by the lord as a gift for the christian community which must be able to benefit from the vocation

1024963 sunday is the day on which the paschal mystery is celebrated in light of the apostolic tradition and is to be observed as the foremost holy day of obligation in the universal church
1024964 many catholics who although they go to mass and fulfill other external requirements of the church live their personal family and public lives as if god did not exist
1024965 anyone who believes in god knows that not only he or she owes god everything they have but that god loves him or her as no one else is capable of loving them
1024966 that is why the compendium of the catechism explains that the words of the first commandment
1024967 a total commitment is paramount to reaching the ultimate in performance
1024968 men of galilee why are you staring at the sky this jesus who was taken up from among you and assumed into heaven shall one day return in the same way in which you saw him go to heaven

1024975 we believe that woman is from the manchester area she gave us very very specific information which we believe is very significant for this investigation i would urge that woman to get back in touch with the police
1024976 there would appear to be a manchester connection with this certain people there at icon were from manchester these are either witnesses or those who we feel are significant to this investigation
1024977 the portuguese attorney general in his recent statement made it very clear indeed that theres absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by kate and gerry in any way shape or form and journalists should bear that in mind when they examine the police files
1024978 a lot of this is historical detail drafted by officers who failed to find madeleine and who quite wrongfully were going down inaccurate lines of supposition and assumption
1024979 kate and gerry are no longer arguidos formal suspects the portuguese judicial system has accepted that they were not involved in madeleines disappearance in any way shape or form and these files should be seen in that context
1024980 all that matters is the search for madeleine kate and gerrys lawyers are continuing to examine all of the information in minute detail and where anything that is relevant to finding madeleine needs to be done it will be
1024981 household consumption surged in june but much of that went to purchase higher priced food and energy
1024982 troubles with the financial sector the economy the u s consumer theres no quick fix
1024983 it means there is some inflation leaking into the system and it puts the fed in a difficult position
1024984 but given the weakness of the economy it means they are going to have to tolerate more inflation than they like
1024985 he worked all day long as usual on sunday and only at night felt unwell
1024986 changed the consciousness of millions of people and forced them to rethink the past and the present

1024991 we need to rebuild position in cuba and other countries
1024992 it is not a secret that the west is creating a buffer zone around russia involving in the process countries in central europe the caucasus the baltic states and ukraine
1024993 in response we may expand our military presence abroad including in cuba
1024994 further tightening of monetary policy may carry risks of its own
1024995 generally felt that policy rates are best kept on hold
1024996 the good news is that for the most part the dams held up well and did what they were supposed to do
1024997 low hazard because they have few people and buildings downstream only minor damage was reported below the dams
1024998 i believe that by not covering this kind of graffiti right away the city is condoning it

1025013 the figures show that organisations havent nailed down the email channel
1025014 email protection is catching on as a technology that manages information as the industry moves away from protect and defense to becoming more aware how information flows around the organisation
1025015 these figures do not surprise me on the whole employees are not sending stuff out maliciously but through carelessness or lack of forethought
1025016 education can help to some extent but many employees are using communications tools all day every day and mistakes will happen so having checks in place makes sense affordability of available technology to tackle the problem is also a problem as most businesses are unable to invest in the high end on premise data leak prevention dlp products that large business can
1025017 it is not that they have not wanted to clamp down on leaks
1025018 they have been aware for some time but it is more the fact that there wasnt the technology to do so email protection is a consolidation of several technologies
1025019 people have been wanting it and now vendors are selling solutions most of which are data leak protection products focused on leaks and not the environment in which leaks occur
1025020 there are a lot of integration issues to consider namely integration with encryption policies different classification of data etc
1025021 a data leak solution needs to fit into wider risk management solution
1025022 they should look at what they are trying to protect how long they need to protect their data for who uses that data etc
1025023 the security industry is oriented around keeping customers in a constant state of fear

1025058 the iraqi governments newly stated position on troop withdrawals has put the mccain campaign and many congressional republicans who have been on record opposing timelines in a difficult position
1025059 recommend s that u s forces be reduced to as few as 50 000 by the spring of 2009 down from about 150 000 now
1025060 the strategy is based on a major hand off to the increasingly successful iraqi army with platoon size u s detachments backing the iraqis from small outposts with air support the large u s forward operating bases that house the bulk of u s troops would be mostly abandoned and the role of special forces would increase
1025061 the more honest among the surge opponents will concede that bush that supposed dolt actually got one right some brave souls might even concede that if the u s had withdrawn in the depths of the chaos the world would be in worse shape today
1025062 success in iraq equals defeat for the dems defeat in iraq equals success for the dems
1025063 who knows we might even get universal health care and a supreme court that renders one liberal decision after another if we can only keep the spirit of failure in iraq alive
1025064 it is about the agenda of the cheerleaders for bad news who love to point out negative things for political gain
1025065 the recent decline in attacks on u s forces and in overall violence in iraq has done nothing to convince americans that the war has been worth fighting sixty three percent said it has not been worth its costs a figure that has changed little over the past two years but 46 percent now say the united states is making significant progress toward restoring civil order there an uptick from 40 percent in april
1025066 the attitudes jesse helms expressed were very popular and commonplace in north carolina
1025067 but we cannot cover up or whitewash the dark side not only of helms but of our own extended families and community histories to pretend that there was no racism in helms or in his political appeal is to perpetuate the blindness into the next generation

1025069 the pundits will offer multitudinous views of his legacy and many of them will be very critical of him to be sure but lots of other people will separate all that from what they knew of the man even though some of their acquaintances wont get it

1025102 its particularly pleasing that a local player has come through the notts academy and made it into the national squad
1025103 hes a very committed player this is the opportunity hes been waiting for
1025104 darren will benefit from playing in the lions game and its a clear indicator that hes not been forgotten
1025105 it gives him another chance to play against south africa without the pressure of a test match environment and hopefully hell do well
1025106 69 percent of semen production comes from the seminal vesicles 30 percent from the prostate and 1 percent from the testes its being manufactured 24 7
1025107 many patients believe they have a limited amount of semen to make do with throughout their lives and they think that because theyve had a habit of masturbation they will not be able to conceive this is absolutely false the body keeps producing semen until the very late years into the 90s it is very much like the working of salivary glands they keep producing saliva throughout ones lifetime
1025108 some patients believe that excessive masturbation leads to impotence tuberculosis and homosexuality
1025109 what happens to the penis when it is inside the vagina during sexual intercourse is the same as what happens when it is inside the folded palm during masturbation
1025110 if you have a good grounding in english it will be easier to pick up friends similarly if you have experience with masturbation it will be easier when the time comes for intercourse
1025111 there is nothing like excessive masturbation which results in the weakening of the genitals the tongue does not grow weak in one who is talkative neither does it become strong if one observes silence
1025112 penis size differs the normal length of the vagina is six inches but only the outer one third two inches of it has maximum sensation the inner two thirds four inches has hardly any sensation
1025113 concentrate on the outside of the vagina the outer one third of it two inches
1025114 bigger is better is the godzilla logic what is important is strength not length
1025115 they tell me that they have swallowed semen during oral sex and ask if they will become pregnant this is absolutely 100 percent impossible and untrue
1025116 while oral sex wont lead to pregnancy it is still possible for sexual transmitted diseases to be passed on via this type of sexual behaviour
1025117 when a patient is dealing with premature ejaculation problems i often tell him to try having sexual intercourse with the woman on top
1025118 but many of my patients believe that having sex with the woman on top will lead to a girl child and that sex with the man on top leads to a boy child of course this is not true science has not shown that different sexual positions can affect the gender of the baby
1025119 this is false information this is the time of a womans menstrual cycle when she is least likely to conceive so these couples are inadvertently minimising their chances
1025120 due to the prevalance of misinformation on the internet television and from friends about 60 70 percent of young couples hold at least one of these misconceptions
1025121 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

1025123 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1025124 barack obamas latest attack ads shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1025125 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1025126 senator obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we really need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we do need to tap the strategic petroleum reserves
1025127 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point
1025128 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1025129 theres little functional difference right now to our economy between the rapid run up of energy prices weve experienced as a result of international conditions and market speculation on the one hand versus a supply interruption on the other
1025130 ill vote for whoever can bring the price of gas down
1025131 if this poll is accurate mccain is dramatically under performing among these voters will we be hearing a mccains working class whites problem meme anytime soon

1025138 one of the interesting options for vmware is providing a place where vmware virtual machines vms can run in an on demand fashion
1025139 after all thats essentially what amazons ec2 cloud is all about ec2 runs amis amazon machine images xen vm images no reason that vmware cant have a datacenter that runs vmware images or add the ability to fire off such images from virtualcenter esx and their other tools
1025140 you can see folks like amazon ec2 ibm blue business platform and etelos etelos marketplace forming their lines for future apps run in on a utility computing infrastructure battles theres no reason vmware could not play effectively in this space
1025141 the concept of the cloud would make a lot of sense
1025142 personally i think vmware is committed to being an isv independent software provider and anything they would do as a cloud computing provider would be stepping on someone elses toes
1025143 if vmware had a strategy to get into cloud computing as an actual provider they would end up competing with most of the companies that they actually supply
1025144 like any enabling technology it needs to test its technology on scale
1025145 solidifying quality data center space for what will probably be a very bright future

1025260 the parties concede that the ultimate objective of entrenching the bangsamoro homeland as a territorial space is to secure their identity and prosperity to protect their property rights and resources as well as to establish a system of governance suitable and acceptable to them as a distinct dominant people
1025261 the relationship between the central government and the bangsamoro juridical entity shall be associative characterized by shared authority and responsibility with a structure of governance based on executive legislative judicial and administrative institutions with defined powers and functions in the comprehensive compact
1025262 in the context of implementing prior and incremental agreements between the grp government of the republic of the philippines and milf it is the joint understanding of the parties that the term entrenchment means for the purposes of giving effect to this transitory provision the creation of a process of institution building to exercise shared authority over territory and defined functions of associative character

1025284 i remember the streetcar that used to pass by our house on albemarle street or was it alameda street no it must have been albemarle street because grandpa drove a coupe and we couldnt fit all twelve of us in the back seat so we would have to split up and take the streetcar blabla bla blabla now go make me another manhattan

1025296 a lot of seniors donated their time to build this center
1025297 every big town i know of has a community center
1025298 its important for the elderly on low incomes to be able to buy a gift like spending a nickel to buy a coffee mug

1025310 tata wants us to be autonomous ive got all the executive authority i need to make both the day to day and the long term executive decisions without having to consult with ratan tata and ravi kant tata motors chief executive my fellow board members
1025311 we can make decisions quickly thats what will be most different from life at ford what we have seen of tata is that it is a very principled organisation with corporate social responsibility high on the agenda but which works differently from the us or european model
1025312 in terms of governance we have set up a small strategy board ratan ravi and me and we will meet every couple of months and review progress on plans strategies and future products

1025315 an unbreakable connection between the unitive meaning and the procreative meaning and both are inherent in the conjugal act
1025316 the inseparable connection established by god which man on his own initiative may not break between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which are both inherent to the marriage act
1025317 that each conjugal act remain ordained in itself to the procreating of human life
1025318 each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life
1025319 god has entrusted spouses with the extremely important mission munus of transmitting human life
1025320 each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life
1025321 the church is not inconsistent when it teaches both that it is morally permissible for spouses to have recourse to infertile periods and also that all directly contraceptive practices are morally wrong
1025322 these two situations are essentially different in the first the spouses legitimately use a faculty that is given by nature in the second case the spouses impede the order of generation from completing its own natural processes
1025323 the argumentation of humanae vitae rests mainly on two points the first is the constant teaching of the church the second is the absolute sacredness and inviolability of the biological functions in every use of marriage
1025324 humanae vitae differs from casti connubii by no longer making the effort to base the teaching of the church in this matter on genesis 38
1025325 the absolute sacredness of the biological rhythm was explicitly rejected
1025326 we are moving to a global village and yet we dont have our global elders the elders can be a group who have the trust of the world who can speak freely be fiercely independent and respond fast and flexibly in conflict situations
1025327 despite all the ghastliness that is around human beings are made for goodness the ones who ought to be held in high regard are not the ones who are militarily powerful nor even economically prosperous they are the ones who have a commitment to try and make the world a better place we the elders will endeavor to support those people and do our best for humanity
1025328 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it

1025334 the job ross and i have is to build a world championship winning team
1025335 i will discuss with uem and chec on the revised cost structure and technical aspects of the new bridge
1025336 rising cost of building materials such as cement iron bars and earth has rendered the current rm3 billion estimates unrealistic
1025337 at this moment uem and chec have yet to finalise the revised cost
1025338 this is an original handmade mandella made of natural sheep wool rabbit fur leather fleece and feathers of various birds
1025339 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1025340 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1025341 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
1025342 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1025343 this was particularly evident for women whose husbands work in independent churches or non church based ministries or even those who work in part time roles within churches

1025353 the church goers did not have to give 1 000 if they couldnt afford it then they couldve given less and some of them did
1025354 it just20really gets my goat when people make unfounded claims and then theyre off with these peoples money
1025355 after a rambling free ranging talk about the worsening economy and the price of gas he told us that he would give us all two things to help us get through perilous times
1025356 all of those scripture verses given do talk about the prospering of gods people the idea that this is always referring to physical wealth is patently absurd avanzini and all of his huckster compatriots only use scripture as proof texts for their own ridiculous claims that god wants everyone wearing brioni suits and rolex watches
1025357 he went through several bible references where stones talked in the old testament here avanzini introduces the stone idea he strolled down the aisles his ring winking in the lights and held out a shiny stone for a woman to hold avanzini told the assembled crowd of about 650 people that these stones should be rubbed whenever people faced rising prices or higher prices at the pump the ushers went down the aisles with buckets of shiny smooth stones and handed them out
1025358 his gideons offering of a goat to god was such a sacrifice for someone who lived in a cave
1025359 perhaps the man sensed a few hostile vibes from the audience from our row in particular because he warned us not to let the devil keep us back from getting free from debt by putting a gift for his ministry on our credit card
1025360 avanzini then prayed an igniting prayer over the stones everyone was clutching presumably we still have to ignite our own with a credit card gift but maybe his igniting prayer was considered the first step the entire thing was an unspeakable tragedy these men target the poor in particular because they are the ones desperate enough to need a breakthrough that is the evil in all of this the rich arent stupid enough to give away their cash to the likes of avanzini its the poor and the needy the hurting and the ill who desperately need help who are vulnerable to these sharks
1025361 joel feels our pain and has made himself wealthy reportedly earning 13 million for his last book advance alone and his church prosperous 75 million and counting in annual revenue by urging us to let go of it to turn it over to god to accept gods favor so that we may be as prosperous as joel
1025362 osteen is one of a new breed of televangelists joyce meyer t d jakes and creflo dollar are also rising stars who are preaching a less sanctimonious more inclusive message his church is in that part of the economy that thrives in troubled times that can count on full pews when wallets are empty and an ever more receptive audience if we do go into a full on recession
1025363 the lord spoke to me and said youre gonna believe for a citation 10 right now

1025390 i think when i really get down to it when i pare away all the trappings and masks and frills of the form i think it is about something none of the photos or the videos or the texts that are published here can reveal changing the energy in the space eventually the space is changed it is not about whether people feel better it is not about how my foot is pointed or my arm is curved it is about what invisible thing we can make happen together we claim the space like reclaimed land and make something happen in it
1025391 esse cara era veterin rio se formou comigo o que diabos ele t fazendo atendendo em dermatologia
1025392 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
1025393 please dont expect to be enlightened with some supposed secret knowledge because nothing exists
1025394 non stiamo cercando di provocare il collasso economico della chiesa cattolica romana ma per illustrare al giudice lentit del complotto contro il nostro ordine
1025395 per favore non si aspettano di essere illuminati con alcuni supposti segreto della conoscenza perch non esiste

1025400 i heard tell that bill gates was gonna move all of microsoft to fort stockton
1025401 big deal microsoft only employs 30 000 people thats only 1 1000th of the size of texas and only 1 10 000th of the usa in fact my working group of concerned citizens say we should compare everything to global numbers so it is only 1 200 000th of the world population and at revenues of only 250 billion a year it only accounts for 1 260th of the world gdp so a hunnert microsofts could show up in pecos county and it still wouldnt solve the worlds gdp problem
1025402 you have been reading those oil shale and anwr articles put out by the puppies and cute animals and certain kinda trees defense council that compare reserves no matter how large to some sort of 100 percentage consumption rate berle you gotta know better than that that is just a trick to minimize the importance of it hell atmospheric co2 is a hundred times smaller than in terms of percentages to anwr and look at all the effects you all ascribe to it
1025403 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it

1025405 uk business schools are world renowned and closely linked with commerce and industry more management students are educated in the uk than in the rest of europe put together
1025406 education in the uk lays emphasis on presentation skills research reports market report journals and online learning which i might not have learnt if i went to college in dubai
1025407 after coming to uk i have seen a radical difference in my presentation skills report writing and market research the uae education is not lacking in any way but it will take time for it to attain international recognition which a graduate from the uk receives
1025408 for families living overseas we offer a guardianship service that ensures the children have a host family based in the uk with whom they can go and stay during weekend and half term breaks we also support a child studying in the uk with travel and pocket money matters and recommend tactics choice of course and timings of ucas applications
1025409 some of the larger schools might be overwhelming to certain students its also important for students to look for schools that offer extra curricular activities that will regularly challenge them outside of the classroom if you like acting or playing the guitar or playing in a football or rugby team then you must select a school that satisfies these needs you are not just selecting a new school but a new home and a new family of friends

1025419 to reward work to ensure working families are better off and to make the tax system fairer i will from next april cut the basic rate of income tax from 22 pence down to 20 pence the lowest basic rate for 75 years

1025425 behind the scenes high ranking air force officers are soberly concerned about ufos but through official secrecy and ridicule many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense

1025432 in june 2006 people magazine published six photos of pitt jolie and baby shiloh who displayed the jolie pillow lipped pout just days after her birth
1025433 this fine wont even be a blip on our earnings
1025434 the downturn in the overall economy and consumer spending along with the serious credit market crunch have put severe pressure on our companys financial position
1025435 if he picked claire mccaskill or janet napolitano or kathleen sebelius i think it would annoy women
1025436 those are women who we spent our lifetime helping run for office
1025437 a lot of us are not happy with these women for not supporting hillary because they came to us for help based in large part on their gender
1025438 i would be very concerned about his judgment if he offered the position to another woman before offering it to hillary clinton
1025439 the women who have been elected to office in this time in history are the beneficiaries of the womens movement
1025440 and its disheartening to see those same women turn their backs on another woman who is better qualified and one can only wonder what they are getting out of their decision to turn their back
1025441 the difficult news this morning is that we thought we were getting a patch but we havent gotten anything
1025442 essentially were at the same place as we were yesterday before apple released the patch
1025443 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the work around for the protocol weakness
1025444 this update addresses the issue by implementing source port randomization to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks
1025445 for mac os x v10 4 11 systems bind is updated to version 9 3 5 p1 for mac os x v10 5 4 systems bind is updated to version 9 4 2 p1
1025446 is apple modifying the bind distributions from isc and somehow didnt realize this repercussion or is there some kind of configuration file that they forgot to change it must be one of those two
1025447 if you take the bind distribution from isc and patch your system on a linux box youre patched

1025453 there are differences and similarities between the civil war and the war today what we do today makes a point were out there to do a job

1025455 i had no idea i think ill look at it the monument in a different light
1025456 weve lost sight of one thing thats important to us knowing who you are when my grandfather retired that became one of the things he did try to find that out and he did

1025458 attract the very best employees and give them a stake in the business
1025459 a democracy is always temporary in nature it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government it will continue to exist until that time that the voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefit from the public treasury with the result that every democracy will collapse this is always followed by a dictatorship or monarchy
1025460 since the beginning of history the great civilizations lasted 200 years during those 200 years they always progressed through the following sequence
1025461 i want you to think about this the oil companies have already been given 68 million acres of federal land both onshore and offshore to drill theyre allowed to drill it and yet they havent touched it 68 million acres that have the potential to nearly double americas oil production
1025462 extrapolates that if you take historical production from offshore and onshore federal leases to the undrilled leases we could double american oil production
1025463 using the same extrapolation the 9 4 billion acres of the currently non producing moon should yield 654 million barrels of oil per day
1025464 die fotos zijn mooi jammer dat ik zo verdomd slecht zie

1025494 in the last 15 years wealth has more than doubled output has increased by nearly two thirds the capital stock by more than half labour productivity by a little under half and the number of jobs by a quarter the growth of income per person has been faster in australia over the period than in canada the us the uk or new zealand
1025495 our gdp performance has been extraordinarily good 2 4 per cent in 2006 australia has in fact enjoyed year on year positive growth for more than 15 years and even during global economic shock periods
1025496 australia has become far more sophisticated with its exports and with value added products we have been very strong in services exports and it shows that our skill sets are in demand globally we have a population of approximately 20 million people living in a big country with many resources however we cannot sustain our economy just by relying on the domestic market for instance the us economy is strongly focused on the domestic market as the population there numbers more than 250 million people so to maintain a successful economy australia has to export its services and products as our population increases the domestic market in australia will also gain more importance in the equation
1025497 australia is an extremely multicultural society which welcomes people from all nationalities backgrounds and religions
1025498 more languages are spoken in sydney than any other city in the world over 100 ethnic groups live in australia making a major contribution to the countrys culture and economic development
1025499 australia is continually adapting to include different cultures and nationalities the culture of australia does not specifically change as most people would expect as acceptance and diversity is so ingrained
1025500 events like glendi are becoming more common in australia as more cultures get integrated into society here its brilliant for example to see a chinese person enjoying greek music and food it really reflects the multicultural face of the country
1025501 the huge gap in demand and supply of jobs and professionals has resulted in a flexible approach in immigration laws the modl lists those occupations and specialisations that are high in demand
1025502 companies such as multiplex and woods bagot which have their head offices in perth reflect western australias strong construction and building materials related capabilities
1025503 the number of australians and australian companies in the uae has increased over the past five years being attracted by the opportunities here for an engineer its certainly an exciting place to be
1025504 australians have a strong ability to come up with new methods for building projects by thinking creatively this manifests in innovative solutions to complex problems
1025505 solutions provided include services such as surveying technology based solutions for land management and city development and architectural design
1025506 one of the popular family activities is the snorkel adventure at catseye beach the coral reef off hamilton island is home to hundreds of tropical fish and visiting children love to wade out with their snorkel goggles and flippers to hand feed the colourful marine life at low tide
1025507 we buy organic food from a local organic greengrocer cafe called sprout but there are heaps of organic fresh delivery services in australia and theyre all on the web you just log on and order
1025508 the standards are high in australia a lot of caf s serve organic food and nearly all grocery stores have organic sections
1025509 like many people here we grow our own organic heritage seed vegetables and fruit currently we have snowpeas lazy housewife beans broad beans spinach 10 different kinds of lettuce lots of herbs artichoke and capsicum
1025510 i have collected organic bushtucker for companies that distribute organic indigenous produce to airlines hotels and restaurants around the world
1025511 in a way its the only food thats genuinely australian and because these plants are native they have no negative impact on the ecosystem and therefore are the most ecologically sensitive crop
1025512 the natural cosmetics industry has also boomed in the past decade
1025513 people are becoming more concerned about the environment and have started to raise questions about the risks of chemical based products
1025514 what projects such as ceres show is that theres a social dimension to organic produce and eco friendly living if you can create a space like that in the middle of a city you can achieve this anywhere
1025515 according to the latest australian education international aei statistics there are around 930 uae nationals currently studying in australia a 22 per cent rise from 2006 this includes privately funded students as well as high achieving students on full scholarships provided by the government
1025516 one of the reasons gulf students are drawn to australia is the climate which in many places matches the gulf climate many people forget australia is largely a desert nation another thing i hear gulf students report about australia is that the education and lifestyle on offer promotes independence so through studying and living in australia they are often challenged to think in different ways to the way they were schooled returning students often mention this as the most challenging and rewarding part of studying in australia this approach also prepares students well for the workforce and is one of the reasons why graduates from australian institutions are very successful in finding jobs
1025517 winston churchill famously observed in 1943 during a prescient address to harvard university that the empires of the future will be empires of the mind australias place in the 21st century will rely entirely on the capacity of our universities to facilitate critical thinking undertake world class research and pass the soul of the nation from one generation to the next

1025574 you cant take an office park mentality with these huge office blobs and put that in the middle of the city we will end with some very dumpy buildings there we cannot let the development industry dictate the outcome
1025575 the physical failings include the continuing lack of any commitment to creating a quality public domain no firm proposals for public transport or integration with the city no cultural program and a strong bias towards a monoculture of bulky office buildings to the exclusion of other uses
1025576 this is a stage along a path to dismantling every part of our design they have skewed it toward a particularly big monolithic type of office it is bulking up and dumbing down the design

1025686 gets its virgin wood fiber clear cut from the north american boreal one of the worlds most important forests
1025687 what rankled me most was the toilet paper but when i protested my wife smiled at me with a mixture of indulgence and contempt
1025688 meanwhile by the weak light shed by the virtuous bulbs i am eating local meat meat from cows organically raised and humanely slaughtered what a phrase it is of course expensive but what is worse it tastes bad that is it tastes like real meat gamy and lean rather than like the processed marbled frozen supermarket stuff i had grown up on im sure it is a better quality and that buying it sustains the local community and strikes a blow against agrabusiness but i just dont like it and since i hate vegetables becoming a vegetarian is not an option
1025689 i agree with you anybody that has been elected must go back to the people to account and that includes the president ministers premiers mayors and councillors
1025690 i have heard the complaints about the mayors and councillors in this area and we will follow up to see what can be done
1025691 what ever you have said here today we need to ensure that the government follows up on your concerns we have to continue to work to ensure that those people who dont have houses toilets running water and electricity have access to these basic services

1025702 of all the things im fed up with i think im fed up most with hearing about the new south
1025703 i would dearly love never to hear the new south mentioned again if there is anything more boring than the questions asked about the south it is the answers southerners give if i hear one more northerner ask about good ol boys and one more southerner give an answer im moving to manaus brazil to join the south carolinians who emigrated after appomattox and whose descendants now speak no english and have such names as senhor carlos calhoun

1025716 as we struggle with climate change food prices fuel shortages and underdevelopment hiv and aids continues to loom large on the radar screen
1025717 nepad the african position on universal access to universal access to hiv and aids prevention treatment care and support as well as the southern africa development community sadc hiv and aids strategy provide a framework for a regional approach to this disease

1025785 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems

1025942 it wouldnt hurt if when a woman came home a guy ran up to her with his tail wagging and he showered her with kisses
1025943 that kind of genuine excitement to see someone is something id like to see in a man to be honest
1025944 they were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer than a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer

1025980 after all it was who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1025981 there are no words sad doesnt do it justice i will always remember skip for his humor and his ability to go about life the way he did i gained so much respect for what he did and how long he did and how he did
1025982 i figured skip caray is as much a part of atlanta braves baseball as any of us
1025983 we all grew up listening to skip whether it be on tv or radio any time the guys on espn imitate you calling the highlights youre pretty much a legend from a fans standpoint hes going to be a huge loss for them because he relayed the games to fans for so long
1025984 he always made a note to come by my locker and shake my hand ask me how i was doing how the family was how my kids were
1025985 personally over the last 15 16 17 years i havent gotten his play by play on the radio or tv but i had a lot of plane flight conversations with him i really respected him as well as the whole caray family they have a pretty good legacy working over there its a sad day for braves baseball
1025986 this was completely unexpected and is a complete loss i had just spoken with skip this week when we did the radio show and i didnt know he wasnt feeling well he seemed in his normal good spirits weve all lost a very good friend for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
1025987 but behind the humor there was an honesty and a commitment to telling it like he believed it to be that never ever varied
1025988 if he didnt like it that a game was two minutes late getting started everybody knew about it if he had an opinion on a player he said it and he had a way of saying it that was sometimes humorous the way he could take a bad ball game in some of those bad years especially and turn it into a fun broadcast whether it was by talking about something in the game or whether it was talking about something that didnt have anything to do with the game maybe it was a movie that was coming up after the game or maybe it was a restaurant that hed gone to it could have been anything he was just a very entertaining broadcaster and a very good one the game was still the most important thing but if game was decided by the fourth or fifth inning people would still watch the rest of the game just to hear what he had to say about things thats a very very unique ability
1025989 regardless of how much you prepare yourself for it youre always surprised
1025990 skip of late seemed to be doing a lot better his immediate future was off of everybodys minds its a surprise a shock
1025991 we were able to joke around with one another laugh at one another and we also had a mutual respect for one another
1025992 ill miss that seeing him around the game taking a jab or two
1025993 for so long he was what people associated with the atlanta braves
1025994 turn on tbs and there was skip good times bad times that was the constant the voice people identify the braves with is skip caray thats going to be missed
1025995 not only are the braves losing somebody special from their organization baseball is too
1025996 its wild how when somebody spends so much time in one organization and has had the history that hes had its very difficult to have it abruptly end especially while hes doing it
1025997 unfortunately he ended up dying doing something he loved itll be a tough day a tough week
1025998 make time for the folks who came to see you no matter how tired you are at the end of the show
1025999 the questions we asked are being debated around the political world every day
1026000 2005 now the strokes franz ferdinand the killers i loled
1026001 dogs were doing what animals usually do defecating and peeing
1026002 there were lots of dogs and they have left lots of things behind and nobody even tried to collect them
1026003 i have no idea how can i train in such conditions and who would clean the discus after every throw
1026004 i am very happy he won this wbo title this means so much to his career i thank the lord for this win
1026005 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now
1026006 actually everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
1026007 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1026008 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised

1026018 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
1026019 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
1026020 i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
1026021 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
1026022 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion nine nine percent of the time it works out for us
1026023 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
1026024 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call

1026069 i just got a text message from so and so from canada
1026070 last year they spent the end of summer in hawaii
1026071 look go ahead and call and see if she can sleepover
1026072 ive been meaning to have her parents over for dinner anyway
1026073 so what have you guys been up to this summer
1026074 well i was threatened at knife point thought that someone had shot our cat and nearly electrocuted myself again
1026075 but i figure our weekends will be busy enough with taking mini me and the boy to their games
1026076 in fact the boy had his first soccer practice on friday and he was a bit disappointed to learn that he does not know one player on his team
1026077 on the one hand he was much quicker seemed a lot less clumsy with the ball challenged the defense this time and actually managed to get a few goals
1026078 cmon what are you waiting for take the ball away from him already
1026079 i simply got up wiped the grass from off of my butt and walked away
1026080 okay so maybe i said that people like her give soccer moms like us a bad name out loud and i may have mentioned it to the boy so what
1026081 but im just not going to enable bad mommy behavior anymore
1026082 in fact id better pour myself another glass just in case
1026083 heres to us and to a happy end of summer vacation
1026084 so um which school newsletter are you in charge of again
1026085 im sure someone will figure it out when i dont show up and then let me know soon
1026086 the banks are saying the nexus is broken that just because rates come down dont expect us to follow i think thats a poor argument
1026087 the first thing they do is increase rates when official rates go up
1026088 if they dont do it we will really see their spin doctors earning their money trying to explain that
1026089 many consumers will find it impossible to understand why thats the case financially or ethically
1026090 i think customers will be absolutely filthy if the banks do not pass on within a reasonable time any official cash rate reductions
1026091 in the current international economic climate and world credit conditions it is essential that our banks remain well capitalised and profitable this is in the interests of depositors borrowers shareholders and the broader australian economy
1026092 the simple fact is that banks like any other businesses have to adjust their prices when their cost base significantly increases
1026093 a lot more to do with the global credit crisis
1026094 we dont think the reserve bank will be confident enough or anxious enough about demand to drop interest rates
1026095 felt their responsibility to themselves to stay healthy and to protect their families outweighed their responsibility to continue working
1026096 the reality is that we will be hit by an influenza pandemic at some point but we dont know if it will be this year or in 50 years time so governments are loathe to spend the money and the effort when they dont know
1026097 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1026098 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1026099 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1026100 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1026101 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1026102 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1026103 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1026104 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1026105 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1026106 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1026107 yes its very depressing being dependent on faceless bureaucrats for some hope of release especially when you know they possess not a shred of compassion or humanity and certainly no sense of fair play or justice being locked up in jail on a long sentence is horrendous enough but for most long term prisoners the certainty of a release date at least provides them with a definite hope of release a cut off point when the hardship and suffering will end and theyll regain their freedom for those serving life there never is any definite hope of release just this constant seemingly endless passage of jail time measured not in the passing of days weeks months and years but in the physical ageing of oneself and the hardening of ones heart in the face of constant parole knock backs and dashed hopes it definitely requires a particular type of strength to retain ones sanity and humanity in such circumstances and of course the cruel irony is that those who survive with dignity courage and grace are usually considered the least suitable for release by the cold heartless bastards who decide on such matters
1026108 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1026109 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1026110 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1026111 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1026112 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1026113 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1026114 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1026115 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1026116 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1026117 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1026118 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1026119 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1026120 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1026121 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1026122 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1026123 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1026124 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1026125 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1026126 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

1026133 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1026134 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

1026255 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1026256 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1026257 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1026258 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1026259 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1026260 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1026261 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1026262 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1026263 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1026264 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

1026274 women diagnosed with breast cancer face an uphill emotional battle
1026275 at a time when they are forced to deal with their own vulnerabilities women with breast cancer must also navigate the vulnerabilities of loved ones as they react to the news
1026276 women who limit their emotions in discussing their breast cancer diagnosis often limit the possibilities for support they can receive
1026277 involving and including others in an illness increases intimacy among friends and family and opens the door to additional support

1026283 i dont think they have evidence that a universal testing strategy is going to lead to lower infection rates and less hiv
1026284 there are some indications to be optimistic but optimism and promise arent proof
1026285 some doctors are still making irrational decisions about hiv testing deciding whether to screen someone based on what he or she looks like baker said adding
1026286 its a real paradox when one big federal agency makes a recommendation that another big federal agency wont support john bartlett a physician said
1026287 i think theyve got to catch up its a disease thats lethal and one of the major problems with hiv today is late entry into care

1026309 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1026310 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1026311 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1026312 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains

1026319 even my staff encounter problems with them we have the endorsement of the narcotics authorities and we give needles not drugs
1026320 so if they catch our clients with drugs we cant stop them but you cant catch those with just needles
1026321 we have our outreach workers getting arrested they authorities raid and catch everyone we are forever trying to bail out our outreach workers from the lockup which is a major headache on a day to day basis
1026322 infections are going up but surveillance is very poor in malaysia

1026344 this is so stupid a lot of the problem is americans as usual spending more than they have and the dumb banks who let them get away with it i feel sorry for neither
1026345 do you believe in god why youve seen no proof of it you dont have to see proof of a thing to see its results or consequences
1026346 i think the media has to take a lot of blame for all the derogatory remarks written about the economy and this country day in and day out
1026347 please just once in a while write about something pleasant and with good common sense
1026348 as usual you dont have a clue just fan flames it is not bushs bail out its your damn demagogs sic you know the jack asses imploding economy really
1026349 youre hysterical and worse out of focus try saying something new and constructive
1026350 the subprime meltdown is a perfect example of the emperor has no clothes phenomenon these were complex products yet obfuscation was considered acceptable bank chief executives should have asked more questions i suspect they saw the juicy profits and hoped underlings understood the risks
1026351 investment banking culture has a cult aspect to it if you work on wall street or in the city you toe the party line despite lip service to diversity diversity of thinking is not encouraged this atmosphere of craven conformity breeds at first complacency and then mistakes
1026352 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1026353 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1026354 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1026355 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1026356 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1026357 dont go chasing waterfalls stick to the rivers and the lakes that youre used to
1026358 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1026359 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1026360 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1026361 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1026362 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1026363 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1026364 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1026365 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1026366 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

1026368 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight

1026370 these results are an impressive start we will work to continue to drive people with type 2 diabetes to their doctors and other resources that can help them improve how they manage their conditions
1026371 blue cross goal was to join together with local employers and providers and help our members in the area who have diabetes be healthier
1026372 similar to the medical home concept as part of this program physicians provided comprehensive coordinated care for their patients that enhanced their health
1026373 taking these tests and knowing the results are significant first steps toward better diabetes management we are encouraged that with early detection treatment and proper management people with diabetes may prevent or delay the onset of complications associated with the disease which range from heart and blood vessel disease blindness and kidney failure to nerve damage foot ulcers and urological problems
1026374 women whose husbands work long hours are more likely to quit their jobs yet mens careers are not impacted when their wives put in long hours
1026375 this suggests a potential return to the separate spheres arrangement breadwinning men and homemaking women as long hours become increasingly common
1026376 resurgence of the separate spheres arrangement the effect of spousal overwork on the employment of men and women in dual earner households
1026377 the fact that more people in the united states are infected with hiv every year than previously thought shows that we need to be working much harder to control the epidemic in the united states
1026378 the united states can be proud of having more than tripled its remarkable commitment to the global hiv aids epidemic
1026379 these new figures from the cdc demonstrate that the domestic epidemic needs a similar response we call on the federal government to renew its commitment to prevention care and research into the hiv aids epidemic in the united states
1026380 right now we have only two cancer centres one in hanoi in the north and one in ho chi minh city in the south this means we can meet only 10 of the country s cancer needs
1026381 it wasnt painful so i didnt think it was anything serious anyway i didnt have any health insurance
1026382 partnering with other leading cancer organisations from around the world and our excellent collaboration with the vietnamese authorities have been critical elements to our assistance to vietnam
1026383 we believe that only a united comprehensive effort covering all aspects of cancer care and control can be truly effective in fighting this terrible disease
1026384 we do have an in car video so we will review that and find out exactly what happened
1026385 a message from earth presents an opportunity for the digital natives of today for whom the internet is both a fact of life and an integral part of their lives to reconnect with science and the wider universe in a simple fun and immersive way
1026386 this partnership between ibm and bridgespan will provide a clear path from the end of a midlife career to an encore career for the greater good
1026387 its a great service for employees and a model for other employers to follow
1026388 the bladesystem portfolio is designed to help customers tackle their infrastructure problems
1026389 this milestone does not come as a surprise as hp continues to reign supreme in revenue and shipments for the sizzling blade market we look forward to shipping our next million blades
1026390 blades have developed into a mature technology in the data centre
1026391 at the same time the improvements in features and functions combo solutions including servers and storage as well as improvements in the software stack drive the blade proposition further downstream making it increasingly viable for smbs

1026394 do we really want to put women at risk to provide raw materials for research a lot of scientists say really isnt the way to go
1026395 you need to have enough eggs to make this thing work and when you have enough eggs it does work
1026396 if these guidelines werent in place wed already have many stem cell lines and be much closer to a treatment for devastating illnesses for which these are so well suited
1026397 you have to give people the tools that are required to determine whether the methodology will work
1026398 one thing is clear we could be spending half as much on health care as america is today and still be as healthy
1026399 one of the things that everyone involved in the health care debate should get over is the notion that we will find a perfect system
1026400 mccains proposal is much more consumer centered and taps into the best aspects of the free market
1026401 our current system a combination of private health insurance government run medicare and medicaid and state run high risk pools only provides true choices to those with perfect health who can be choosy about their health insurance policy or those with an employer who offers lots of coverage options
1026402 i am reluctant to start toting up lots of savings that could occur in theory when we do not see those savings in practice
1026403 isnt this really a story about electronic medical records and public reporting and how america despite spending nearly twice as much on average as other advanced industrial nations on health care lags behind on these measures of performance just as it does on life expectancy infant mortality and unnecessary medical errors
1026404 people who care about health care coverage need to engage as aggressively on the cost question as they do on the coverage question
1026405 how do we expect to get our economic situation fixed with 15 of our economy tied up in a wasteful system
1026406 we could accomplish something better by putting the uninsurable in mainstream health plans using proven market based reinsurance principles and underwriting rules
1026407 continue to exceed general consumer price inflation for the foreseeable future
1026408 when i say no one of importance or premiership ability has left except mcbride i

1026414 we are very pleased to present funfun to global gamers
1026415 we need gps to be able to identify sexual health needs and be confident talking about sex
1026416 there are some who havent really been interested in engaging with sexual health
1026417 there are differences in the basic level of care that people should be able to expect wherever they are
1026418 some gps are unwilling or unable to cope with these sensitive issues
1026419 when people increased their calorie intake after weight loss the bone remodelling markers did not respond and remained above what they were before weight loss
1026420 however unlike the weight loss phase it appeared that bone breakdown and bone formation were balanced rapid rates of bone remodelling regardless of the balance of breakdown and formation can increase bone fragility

1026422 we chose to bring this game to the west because we believe in its potential the guaranteed fun promotion is our way of showing our belief in the game and is even better than a money back guarantee because you dont have to spend a penny to play asda story

1026424 yes yes yes the atlanta braves have given you a championship listen to this crowd
1026425 here comes bream heres the throw to the plate he iiiiiiiisssssssss safe braves win braves win braves win braves win braves win

1026427 i got to talk to him yesterday and i told him i loved him and he started laughing because i was stuck in new york
1026428 it was our own private little joke i at least got to tell him i loved him which was the last thing i said to him so im grateful for that
1026429 there are no words sad doesnt do it justice i will always remember skip for his humor and his ability to go about life the way he did i gained so much respect for what he did and how long he did and how he did
1026430 i figured skip caray is as much a part of atlanta braves baseball as any of us
1026431 we all grew up listening to skip whether it be on tv or radio any time the guys on espn imitate you calling the highlights youre pretty much a legend from a fans standpoint hes going to be a huge loss for them because he relayed the games to fans for so long
1026432 he always made a note to come by my locker and shake my hand ask me how i was doing how the family was how my kids were
1026433 personally over the last 15 16 17 years i havent gotten his play by play on the radio or tv but i had a lot of plane flight conversations with him i really respected him as well as the whole caray family they have a pretty good legacy working over there its a sad day for braves baseball
1026434 this was completely unexpected and is a complete loss i had just spoken with skip this week when we did the radio show and i didnt know he wasnt feeling well he seemed in his normal good spirits weve all lost a very good friend for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
1026435 but behind the humor there was an honesty and a commitment to telling it like he believed it to be that never ever varied
1026436 if he didnt like it that a game was two minutes late getting started everybody knew about it if he had an opinion on a player he said it and he had a way of saying it that was sometimes humorous the way he could take a bad ball game in some of those bad years especially and turn it into a fun broadcast whether it was by talking about something in the game or whether it was talking about something that didnt have anything to do with the game maybe it was a movie that was coming up after the game or maybe it was a restaurant that hed gone to it could have been anything he was just a very entertaining broadcaster and a very good one the game was still the most important thing but if game was decided by the fourth or fifth inning people would still watch the rest of the game just to hear what he had to say about things thats a very very unique ability
1026437 i knew that he had been battling some health issues but i was just really shocked and saddened when i got the e mail
1026438 and i was grateful for the many years i was able to be with skip from 1976 until 1990 skip saw the funny side of things and enjoyed making people laugh when we werent giving them too much to smile about during some of those years that i was with the braves
1026439 if you promise to patronize our sponsors you have permission to go walk the dog

1026544 it was always the ubiquitous they those indefinable conspirators who would inevitably force the market to go the opposite you were playing it they were the rumormongers who forced stock and commodity prices to fluctuate wildly regardless of the economic climate they were the ones who toyed with the military industrial complex of the fifties and the sixties and then with the oil powers of the seventies they profited from those long lines of gas hungry cars and the shortages of everything from aluminum to wheat they were the brains the real insiders with all the money to manipulate the markets to make even more they were the immovable forces that gave you that lonely feeling that you were up against it the ones that always profited by your mistakes they were the ones who used pit gossip to create doubts about your stature as a shrewd trader they were the enemy heartless calculating always on the offensive forever elusive they were everything you werent

1026616 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1026617 natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations
1026618 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1026619 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1026620 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests

1026622 i found this paper interesting because the experimental and computational analysis
1026623 everything was going very well until we arrived in maoz esther
1026624 from behind a little hill suddenly emerged some cars and policemen wearing civilian clothes but with police hats and they arrested the one who shot in the air as well as some of our other escorts who were carrying weapons
1026625 apparently the police were waiting and watching the whole time doing nothing until our boy shot in the air
1026626 the fact is that police forces were there we understood that like last week when there was a violent incident when the hikers came to the bedouin with weapons we were ready because we knew that this was a place of confrontation the bedouin set up cameras and therefore the police were there
1026627 if the police were there and watched the confrontation why did the police not just stand openly and prevent the hikers from passing if it was not permitted why did they not just stop them the situation as i see it looks like an ambush hiding out like thieves in the night
1026628 im not the one who decides there are officers above me who decide what is overt and what is concealed
1026629 i have asked the public security minister avi dichter for a response and i expect to receive an answer within a few days i have no doubt that the police were engaged in a provocation just as they have been in other places such as a recent incident in the southern mount hevron area and elsewhere
1026630 another step in the police agreeing to become a political police in the service of the olmert government

1026667 the chick disappearance happened at the same time as the pigeon bait which may have been used to lure the falcons close enough to be shot or may have been laced with poisonous chemicals
1026668 the fact that this activity has occurred at one of the longest known peregrine nests is devastating the group has confirmed over 50 incidents of persecution during our peregrine studies and we suspect over a hundred more there is no place in society for such illegal activity targeting raptors
1026669 we suspect these incidents are all linked to individuals within pigeon racing communities and their perception of peregrine falcon impacts on racing pigeons
1026670 we welcome a meeting with pigeon racing associations in the autumn to discuss a way forward for addressing racing pigeon predation by peregrines
1026671 we know peregrines kill some racing pigeons the falcons cannot distinguish between wild and racing pigeons but pigeons are not the only prey peregrines eat a wide range of other birds the killing or attempted killing of peregrine falcons is not the way to resolve the issue
1026672 police are investigating a report that a live pigeon was tethered down at the glenarm peregrine site in order to attract larger birds of prey
1026673 investigations are also ongoing to establish whether the pigeon had been laced with poison this is often done to harm birds of prey that come into contact with tethered pigeons and is also illegal
1026674 police treat reports of animal cruelty extremely seriously and would appeal for anyone with information on this incident or other similar acts to contact us on 0845 600 800 alternatively information can also be passed anonymously to the crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111

1026751 minco silvers goal is to become one of the top 10 primary silver producers one can see how the company is striving toward that goal with minco silvers announcement of a 31 increase in the indicated resource on its fuwan silver project
1026752 there is a great potential for upside due to the fact that a very small percentage of the fuwan deposit has been explored to date with a potential of 157 million ounces of silver in the fuwan silver project each share of minco silver controls about 5 ounces of silver

1026764 in the old days olympic athletes were well taken care of and lived a more privileged life in cuba but things had gotten so bad that we werent much better off than anyone else
1026765 i will always be cuban and proud of my heritage but i had to follow my dream
1026766 we will not expose a cuban team again to the excesses and provocations that in this case would occur in chicago in us territory an ideal location for merchants and traffickers to act freely with the complicity of us authorities
1026767 i wouldnt say the cuban boxers are weak because even when they lose great fighters there are other ones coming up behind them but this team is not as experienced as theyve been before
1026768 and the defections might continue because kids are more aware of the world now with the internet promoters are going after those cuban kids and its hard to keep them from chasing their dream
1026769 the government took care of felix savon and he was very loyal but those were different times i have trouble keeping kids amateur in my gym so imagine how hard it is in cuba
1026770 we cant talk at this moment about grand goals or compare them with the athens team this team will enjoy their experience in the ring without thinking about medals
1026771 the situation today is very similar to that of barcelona 1992 when we arrived with no olympic experience due to our absence in los angeles 1984 and seoul 1988 and returned with seven gold medals

1026790 given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical

1026800 concerns about iraq remain but the war is not the only top tier issue among voters many have turned their focus to domestic issues such as health care energy the mortgage crisis and immigration
1026801 more than half the voters in an ongoing survey for the associated press and yahoo news say the economy and health care are extremely important to them personally they fear they will face unexpected medical expenses their homes will lose value or mortgage and credit card payments will overwhelm them
1026802 the war is becoming a less defining issue among democrats nationally and it has moved to the back of the stage in the rush of campaign rallies town hall meetings and speeches that are bringing the caucus competition to an end instead candidates are being asked about and are increasingly talking about the mortgage crisis rising gas costs health care immigration the environment and taxes

1026833 the economy and society should be run democratically to meet the needs of the whole community not to make profits for a few
1026834 criticized the existing capitalistic mode of production and its consequences but it could not explain them and therefore could not get the mastery of them it could only simply reject them as bad
1026835 present the capitalistic mode of production in its historical connection and its inevitableness during a particular historical period and therefore also to present its inevitable downfall
1026836 so tell me this obama if citizens are the ones paying for it now who is going to pay for it under your plan citizen taxpayers oh wait thats still the citizens

1026840 what mattered in 1932 however was the mandate from the voters the 13 senate seats and the 97 house seats that came along with roosevelts landslide t his is maybe the most important difference between a ticket led by barack obama and one headed up by hillary clinton
1026841 if obama wins come november it will be up to that grassroots that congregation not only to hold his feet to the fire but also and more importantly to press forward the extra electoral politics that brought real hope and real change to america nearly half a century ago
1026842 i know for the political cognoscenti like many of us here at daily kos obama appears to be running a content free campaign

1026897 die einschulung ist f r kinder ein wichtiger schritt auf dem weg zum erwachsenwerden den die eltern begleiten sollten
1026898 kinder freuen sich normalerweise auf ihren ersten schultag und ihre neue rolle darauf k nnen eltern aufbauen
1026899 die schult te sollte aber nicht zum statussymbol f r die eltern werden
1026900 wenn eltern sich gegenseitig zu bertrumpfen versuchen w re das ein grundlegend falscher einstieg in die schulzeit in der kinder unter schiedlicher sozialer herkunft gemeinsam lernen und leben sollen
1026901 ein kind t glich zur schule zu fahren und nach schulschluss wieder abzuholen ist dagegen eine berbeh tung eltern tun ihren kindern keinen gefallen wenn sie sie nicht schritt f r schritt unabh ngiger werden lassen
1026902 kinder neigen dazu viel zu viele dinge mit sich herumzuschleppen und damit den r cken zu berlasten
1026903 deshalb sollten eltern den inhalt des schulranzens ab und zu kontrollieren ist er auf dauer zu schwer kann das zu wirbels ulenverkr mmungen und fu verformungen f hren

1026910 die tatsache dass man die sch lerinnen und sch ler dar ber hinaus dazu verpflichtet an vier tagen der woche bis 16 00 uhr in der schule zu bleiben ndert in keiner weise etwas an der belastung und dem stress dem die sch lerinnen und sch ler hier genauso wie in anderen l ndern ausgesetzt sind
1026911 ohne eltern oder sch lerinnen die freude am schulstart tr ben zu wollen m ssen wir darauf hinweisen dass das turbo abi auch in rheinland pfalz nur f r besonders begabte sch lerinnen und sch ler geeignet sei kann von der landesregierung erwarten wir dass sie sich langfristig zu der wahlfreiheit zwischen g8 und g9 schulen bekennt
1026912 bildung ist ein grundrecht f r dessen finanzierung der staat zust ndig ist es wird zeit dass es auch in rheinland pfalz endlich wieder die schon seit langem geforderte allgemeine lernmittelfreiheit gibt ohne wenn und aber bis dahin m chte ich die bildungspolitikerinnen und bildungspolitiker unseres landes bitten die begriffe chancengleichheit und bildungsgerechtigkeit nicht mehr selbstbeweihr uchernd in den mund zu nehmen

1026916 current psaps need a path to migrate towards a future set of capabilities consistent with the new net 911 act calling for a national migration plan to ip based emergency communications there is clearly an opportunity to converge voice video and data into a mission critical environment
1026917 using ip is a cost effective approach to modernizing current operations while at the same time delivering inherent disaster recovery benefits to provide a truly resilient environment
1026918 at ppss we are pleased with the ongoing success of our voice over ip for emergency response viper solution with over 400 agencies serving over 1 800 positions installed and growing viper is helping our customers to gracefully move towards the utilization of ip for their emergency call handling services our collaboration with cisco systems is a further testament to the flexible design of the viper platform and our commitment to enable ip services within the public safety community
1026919 it is an important time in our history and it is exciting to be setting the standard to meet the evolving needs of public safety agencies locally and around the world

1026924 donde quiera que dirijamos nuestra mirada encontraremos una estrecha correlaci n entre sida y desigualdad
1026925 el sida no es s lo un problema de salud sino tambi n de desarrollo de justicia y de equidad
1026926 es el momento de unir nuestras fuerzas para que esos tratamientos y esa asistencia que tantas vidas est n salvando lleguen a todos los enfermos de sida

1026931 from what ive seen ive been very impressed it was my first session today and the boys are a great bunch of lads and im really looking forward to the start of the season reid said
1026932 i know a few of the guys from when i was at wollongong and you can only tell by the performance in the asian champions league what a good squad adelaide has
1026933 the council felt that with the presence of foreign players local players have not been given the opportunity
1026934 we are back to the drawing board our focus now will be development
1026935 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal
1026936 it is difficult for us to take a decision but arsenal is certainly something that gokhan needs to look at
1026937 its difficult to keep them i think we have a good youth system which is very important to ajax but its been like this for the last 25 years
1026938 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
1026939 im feeling very good here very well here and at the moment my heart is with arsenal
1026940 i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever
1026941 im very happy weve found a solution i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
1026942 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
1026943 were not as short of strikers as people thought vela is integrating very well into the team and bendtner was already a force at the end of last season and he will confirm that this year
1026944 bischoff is a new player that is young and promising with talent
1026945 the changes in web technologies over the last several years such as user generated content and ajax based applications require a security approach that goes beyond basic url filtering
1026946 purewire has taken a unique approach to address the complete web security problem particularly with the companys focus on script based browser attacks and user reputation which are needed to maintain trust and safety in todays web environment
1026947 todays dynamic and interactive web environment is the new threat vector of choice and the security industry as a whole is a decade late in innovating ways to secure the new web
1026948 the purewire web security service integrates sophisticated technology and analysis to bring the highest levels of security performance and control to web users in the office or on the go and trust back to the web
1026949 as web based attacks become more sophisticated web security solutions will play an increasingly valuable role as an enhancement to traditional url filtering anti virus and firewall deployments
1026950 we built the purewire service from the ground up as saas providing organizations with instant access to innovative technologies without the time and costs associated with hardware or software installs and maintenance for our partners this offers a quick entry into a rapidly growing market and the highest quality of security performance and control available
1026951 our enterprise customers are asking to move more security solutions to the cloud weve already seen a tremendous response on the email security service side and now the demand is growing for web
1026952 weve worked with the team launching purewire for many years in the atlanta security market and are confident purewire will deliver the service support and margins to support its channel partners
1026953 we have around 1500 members at our gym and provide them with kiosk internet access to surf the web while at our facility since they arent employees of our organization we have very little control over end user education on where they go on the web at the same time we need to maintain control over where our pcs are going and what types of threats they might be bringing back to our network
1026954 this makes having a flexible web security solution critical the purewire web security service was an easy decision to make easy to deploy no requirement for hardware easy to manage and has no impact on the user experience in any way
1026955 when the u s sneezes latin america catches a cold
1026956 there is a lot of evidence that emerging market investors are under weighted when it comes to latin america while asia will clearly continue to be a huge driver of growth in the world it will be negatively affected by all three economic crises the world is facing credit crunch oil shortage and food shortage latin america will actually benefit from two of those crises oil and food and be less affected by the third further latin america specifically mexico peru colombia chile and brazil is now largely investment grade or near investment grade in fact latin america is a stability story uncertainty has dissipated and the region has de coupled from the u s economy theres an opportunity to invest relatively early in stability
1026957 governments and financial institutions in latin america have learned their lessons from the crises of the 80s and 90s they are truly careful not to make the same mistakes
1026958 u s banks given their crisis might find themselves looking at say chilean brazilian mexican or argentine banks as role models for recovery and turnaround
1026959 contrary to the fears of some the left leaning leaders in latin america look like the european left not like the irresponsible south american governments of the past chavez morales and correa are really the exceptions most leaders including those in brazil mexico peru colombia and chile are making very responsible monetary fiscal trade and pro business decisions
1026960 its not enough to drop a big number into a story as difficult as it might have been to find that number and expect people to be wowed or even grateful a lot of our effort involves coming up with a perspective that will succeed in connecting our findings with the experiences and or feelings of those we hope will read about them to provide the necessary context and a pretext for readers to take a chance on hearing more of what we had to say we came up with words that paint a stark comparison to the reconstruction realities of an earlier war
1026961 yeah just come on up and when you drive in give them your license and
1026962 weve heard there are some things going on here were newspaper reporters would you care to talk to us about it
1026963 hey do you know anybody living in building 18 have you ever been in there
1026964 i just want you to know that we have been up here and you will see that in the story
1026965 so i suppose youre not coming to the press conference tomorrow
1026966 theyre probably going to find the building theyre probably going to clean building 18 up
1026967 come on come on lets get through that so we can get to the broken part
1026968 no no no no youre not going to get the impact unless you can describe the world
1026969 wow okay something bad is happening i have a chance to be part of something and publish a book on my experience with this
1026970 you have to be crazy of course im going to go on the record i am a staff sergeant in the u s army and my army is not supposed to be treating people this way
1026971 she seemed glad to see me when i appeared in the kitchen and by watching her i began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl
1026972 this is belated recognition of the powerful work done by walcott in directing his colleagues in developing stories that were unappreciated and almost totally unnoticed at the time because so many journalists fell short in their pre iraq war coverage theres a real need to recognize this dogged editor who went about his business in a resolute way to challenge many of the justifications for the war that proved to be false
1026973 in recognizing walcott we wanted to honor the spirit of izzy stone as much as the reporting done by the knight ridder team and we wanted to emphasize that the spirit of i f stone can still flourish in an institutional setting that you dont necessarily have to be out there all by yourself to do the right thing
1026974 part of the press now recognizes that most of the news media were duped by the bush administrations highest officials walcott and two especially tenacious reporters operating as a formidable closely knit trio were the only journalists out of hundreds of american reporters and editors across the nation working on pre invasion stories who got it right that is producing solid stories starting a year before the invasion began reporting that the administration was manipulating intelligence to conceal dire forecasts that the iraq invasion was headed into a morass to rival the vietnam war disaster
1026975 there was simple laziness much of what the administration said especially about iraq and al qaeda simply made no sense yet very few reporters bothered to check it out they were stenographers they were not reporters
1026976 it seems ever more clear to me that higher levels of civilization must depend even more heavily on a conscientious respect for the importance of honesty and clarity in reporting the facts and on a stubborn concern for accuracy in determining what the facts are
1026977 a bad team of developers tends to be the no 1 cause of software project failures

1027000 to begin a search for definitive answers both to complete the historical record of 9 11 and more importantly to give a straight story to all those who are worried about their futures
1027001 the editorial page normally comments on events and information that are out there for general discussion and maybe on this page a reader will find out some facts that will advance the argument that the board wants to make but its generally not of a big sweeping overarching issue that involves thousands of people
1027002 this could have been written as a straight ahead investigative project on the news side but i dont think it would have had the impact
1027003 however powerful the information would have been presented in a completely neutral way and the findings could not have been wrapped into a call for action as could happen on the editorial page
1027004 opinion journalism is changing a great deal because now everyone has an opinion and everyone has an instant opinion
1027005 to my mind it clearly is not simply to look at the top five stories in the paper and offer an opinion about them you have to re report on your own for the editorial page and you need to find new information about a story editorials should bring a new perspective people should learn something more than what you think about it they should learn why you think it and if you could add value to it thats a good thing

1027011 mobile advertising revenues are expected to exceed two billion dollars in the united states by 2012

1027036 alternatively if breakfast is consumed with other students or with family members then the social interaction might lead to increased alertness a prerequisite for the successful completion of cognitive tasks

1027064 because as i do you see heavy and dangerous storm of muslim christian tensions menacing the world in which we live

1027073 who are you sir why are you being so generous to me
1027074 i am a friend thats all you need to know
1027075 i am pleased to meet you sir cloud strife my name is aerith
1027076 i will forever remember your kindness i hope god will bless you and make all your wishes come true
1027077 well weve done it choukei kun we now have a sennin world where both humans and youkai co exist peacefully
1027078 taikoubou suusu would have been pleased if only he were here
1027079 knowing suusu its impossible to find him unless he intentionally reveals his whereabouts escaping is one of his many talents after all
1027080 he could have helped us here you know instead of pretending to be dead and letting us do all the hard work
1027081 thats suusu for you always the slacker i have to admit i got annoyed when i heard the news from suupuushan and bukichi that guy he got me depressed for nothing
1027082 but ive finally understood why suusu did what he did
1027083 if he were here we would have depended on him on what to do
1027084 it was difficult but we managed to succeed didnt we
1027085 and i have to thank you and nentou sama for helping me out i couldnt have done this all alone
1027086 he seems to be headed to ryuukitsu place and he was bringing a pot of flowers too
1027087 suupuushan why do you think nentou san wanted those flowers
1027088 ah youre right bukichi kun maybe on his way to meet his sister
1027089 is it just me or does he look a bit anxious
1027090 shes telling them to take a break and stroll around the island
1027091 ah based from what ive heard ryuukitsu san wants to cultivate anemones here in hourai island she was planning to send hekiun san and sekiun san tomorrow to the human world to gather some anemones but nentou san had surprised her by bringing that pot of anemones
1027092 she is thanking him now and telling him that she really appreciates what he did nentou san says it was nothing hed do anything to make her happy
1027093 by the way why are you spying on nentou and koushu
1027094 and like whatve said earlier nentou san is such a doting brother i am surprised how well they get along su considering they seemed to be polar opposites of each other su
1027095 even their powers are opposite ryuukitsu koushu san uses water while nentou san uses fire
1027096 hmm well i do agree how different those two are from each other
1027097 taiitsu i have trapped the robots inside a ball of water to prevent them from moving around please use your kyuuryuu shinkatou to gather them
1027098 thanks koushu you dont know how much it means to me to get those robots back in one piece
1027099 those evil things destroyed the new sennin community hall they should be annihilated
1027100 hmm this reminds me i have a similar experience to that of taiitsus
1027101 how long have you been lurking behind us su and more importantly why are you here su
1027102 hmm long enough to know what you were conversing about you were too busy chatting so you didnt notice my presence
1027103 anyway i was just passing by the area saw you people here and decided to join thats it
1027104 it happened last week when one of my bioxin accidentally slipped out of its glass cage
1027105 unchuushi i found this wandering around my place i think this belongs to you
1027106 unchuushi i need to talk to you about oneesama what is that horrid creature youre holding
1027107 i cant allow your hands to be tainted by that thing here let me dispose that for you
1027108 nentou just doesnt get it how men of science like us feel every time our precious invention gets destroyed those things are like our children
1027109 but you know if i had powers id do the same those ooze like things are icky
1027110 well master and i were just passing by the area
1027111 and you saw us here and decided to join su
1027112 wow you can read my mind now or something suupuu
1027113 you told us the same thing that taiitsu san and unchuushi san said earlier
1027114 are you sure you didnt come here to intentionally spy on nentou san and ryuukitsu san
1027115 it was quite ungrateful of you to say such a thing about my bioxin when theyve helped you heal your injuries once
1027116 ah look what a lovely weather we have today dont you agree bukichi
1027117 but taiitsu san dont we have the same weather everyday here in hourai
1027118 this is unfair su you people are treating me as if i dont exist su
1027119 nentou san is currently standing right in front of us
1027120 ah i forgot i have some work left to do in my lab
1027121 now that you mention it i just remembered i have to finish the new bioxin xx45 formula
1027122 igo we need to resume your training now just because the war is over doesnt mean you can slack

1027126 greg your son christopher is an artist just like you
1027127 preach the word of god be persistent whether the time is favorable or not patiently correct rebuke and encourage your people with good teaching for a time is coming when people will no longer listen to right teaching they will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever they want to hear they will reject the truth and follow strange myths but you should keep a clear mind in every situation dont be afraid of suffering for the lord work at bringing others to christ complete the ministry god has given you
1027128 i have finished the race and i have remained faithful and now the prize awaits me the crown of righteousness that the lord the righteous judge will give me on that great day of his return and the prize is not just for me but for all who eagerly look forward to his glorious return
1027129 i remember my mothers prayers and they have always followed me they have clung to me all life
1027130 well why dont we get this to go with your new figure

1027144 obama supports releasing light oil from the emergency oil stockpile now and replacing it later with heavier crude more suited to the countrys long term needs according to a campaign fact sheet light crude oil is easier to refine into gasoline than heavier oil
1027145 also on monday the obama campaign unveiled a television ad that criticizes republican john mccains energy policies
1027146 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1027147 the report looked into the nutritional quality of kids meals at 13 major restaurant chains the center found 93 percent of 1 474 possible choices at the 13 chains exceed 430 calories an amount that is one third of what the national institute of medicine recommends that children ages 4 through 8 should consume in a day
1027148 subways kids meals came out the best among the chains examined in the report
1027149 the report notes that eating out now accounts for a third of childrens daily caloric intake twice the amount consumed away from home 30 years ago

1027153 oi hediard quit gawking at that woman over there or else ill tell matsu chi on you
1027154 and even if i were i see no reason for god to care about it
1027155 well i hope you are right because i really cant picture my matsu chi ending up with a
1027156 i will forget every insult youve thrown in my direction just do me a favor and shut up
1027157 you mean you dont mind if i showed matsu chi
1027158 eh i thought you dont care about what she thinks
1027159 because today im going to teach you how to win a fight without a sword
1027160 you must know how to defend yourself using even just your bare hands
1027161 which is why todays lesson will be all about boxing
1027162 are you ready to learn how to box like a pro
1027163 okay before we start with the basic lessons i must first test your punching strength
1027164 that is the kind of punch im looking for so strong you truly are the son of kou hiko
1027165 lets go tenka show me more of that punching power
1027166 that was exactly the same thing that tenka said to me
1027167 how can you be so happy even after getting beat up like that
1027168 taiitsu nothing satisfies a teacher more than to discover that his student has gotten stronger than before
1027169 its a medicine i made to cut down a persons healing time to just thirty minutes
1027170 it looks like it can do you more harm than good
1027171 you are so superficial taiitsu just because it looks like this doesnt mean its dangerous why dont you try it
1027172 no thanks im fine having all these cuts and bruises even if it takes days for them to heal
1027173 how would i know i just concocted this fifteen minutes ago
1027174 good thing i got these injuries now i am able to test its effects on myself
1027175 you can go through here this guy wont oppose any resistance
1027176 amistad i never watched the movie but now i will the history of the boat stems from freed slaves who were captured and then freed when they revolted on the ship halifax has a large black community the history of how they treated black canadians is not found in school books
1027177 i think that cat has already forgotten who his real master is
1027178 are you jealous because karupin chan has become very fond of me
1027179 but im surprised how easily you got on his good side this cat is very picky you see he prefers to mingle with only a few select people
1027180 well he is my cat after all weve been together for so long we have strangely developed this tendency to like the same things
1027181 oh so that means i have karupin to thank for rubbing off his good taste on you
1027182 well it seems good taste isnt the only thing he got from you
1027183 gas prices down means inflation pressures subside leading mortgage rates lower
1027184 do you think rates will be higher later this year
1027185 the u s government on purpose or not upgraded mortgage bonds to treasury class mortgage rates fall
1027186 we expect to continue to pursue increases to our management and guarantee fees and delivery fees on bulk and flow transactions to better reflect our expectations of future default costs
1027187 to pad our bottom line against foreclosures we plan to increase loan level fees for all conforming borrowers
1027188 so long as growth stays steady money should flow into the mortgage bond market this drops rates
1027189 when the federal reserve implies a guarantee of mortgage backed bonds interest rates are sure to fall
1027190 but i think its right for me at this time
1027191 there has been this attitudinal change that serving overseas and getting involved in poverty alleviation and working to help others help themselves has motivated individuals to do something as an individual to make a difference applying for peace corps is one of those things
1027192 if you come with a positive attitude and whatever comes at you take it and run with it youll find projects are more fulfilling that way
1027193 i hope that it would enrich my life and that i would be able to contribute something to other people
1027194 when i first saw the presentation i knew i wanted to be part of it
1027195 it fit right along with my career aspirations and goals
1027196 there are areas of my life where i see i need to mature with the peace corps i can mature a lot and also become aware of different cultures
1027197 i thought id get in some traveling and volunteer work
1027198 at the start of the season which is april we did see an impact for the months of april and may
1027199 what we found was instead of coming up ahead of time people were trying to plan more but now this summer since june our number of reservations is about the same as last year

1027204 theres a storm outside i didnt get to sleep well last night and that friend of yours is making me wait for him tell me whats so good about the morning yamamoto takeshi
1027205 hmmm it seems the rumor ive heard from some of the guys is true
1027206 hey i know a couple of shops downtown and they sell some of the best milk based products ive ever tasted i can give you the address if you want
1027207 haha i swear that is the least of my intentions
1027208 tearing his eyes away from bianchi he began lifting a chair off the trolley
1027209 but seriously bianchi you should be more concerned about your health
1027210 you know the last thing i need is for someone to go health police on me
1027211 heh you and gokudera are really blood related he told me exactly the same thing yesterday when i tried to make him eat more calcium enriched food
1027212 tsk tsk the deficiency really runs in the family eh
1027213 hey yamamoto takeshi care to explain why this place looked so different now as compared to yesterday
1027214 well lets just say a couple of friends from way way back made a surprise visit last night
1027215 so what if i do do you have a problem with that yamamoto takeshi
1027216 i do wonder if bianchi san would be nicer to me if i were a five year old kid
1027217 well if only youd stop picking fights with me then we wouldnt have any problems would we
1027218 see youre doing it again you are trying to contradict me when you and i know that i am speaking nothing but the truth
1027219 well never get along well if you always do things that get on my nerves
1027220 it kind of saps your will to live doesnt it

1027224 does availability of data lead to acceptance of one another through our common understanding of one another through all this available data or does this drive us further apart in our respective paranoias
1027225 this new tool offers a google maps like view of integrative genomic data
1027226 it brings together different kinds of genomic data into a single holistic view im incredibly proud of our computational scientists for responding so rapidly and effectively to the critical needs of the growing genomics research community
1027227 other tools offer detailed localized views of genomic data and a few tools are equipped to provide a whole genome view
1027228 igv was designed to integrate both and to provide smooth zooming and panning across all resolution scales
1027229 most visualization tools are limited in their ability to handle multiple types of genomic data and are typically retrofitted to accommodate new data types as they have arisen
1027230 igv was designed from the ground up to integrate all of these data and to provide a strong platform for future growth and refinement
1027231 before i was introduced to igv i had to use three different programs to visually integrate my data
1027232 but now this one universal browser allows me to rapidly scan the entire genome and identify promising regions which has revolutionized my work
1027233 this tool is designed to enable researchers to view many types of genomic data especially those relevant to human disease
1027234 were particularly excited about its already groundbreaking use in ongoing studies of the cancer genome
1027235 these results mean that the tevatron experiments are very much in the game for finding the higgs
1027236 in the past year alone the two experiments have produced 77 ph d s and 100 publications that advance the state of our knowledge across the span of particle physics at the energy frontier
1027237 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1027238 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1027239 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
1027240 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them
1027241 school is the absolute best way to get information out to adolescents no matter who is teaching the important thing is getting the teacher to make a connection if the teacher can make the right connection with one kid youve saved one person from getting hiv youve saved one persons life
1027242 job growth matters but only if you could get it where jobs are needed the most we found that jobs had a bigger impact on reducing poverty in smaller metropolitan areas because if you live in a small area you can get to where the jobs are but if you live in columbus or cleveland or new york or atlanta it is going to be harder to get to the jobs
1027243 many lower skilled workers are single mothers with children who dont have reliable transportation their kids get sick so they miss a couple of days of work and then they get fired so finding ways of breaking down this kind of barrier so they can work can really make a difference
1027244 you tend to find out about jobs from your friends coworkers and neighbors but if you live in an area that is downtown and the jobs are being created out in the suburbs it will be more difficult to find out what jobs are available
1027245 in some suburbs there are particular kinds of zoning that make it difficult to create affordable housing lot size requirements and zoning that keeps out apartments puts limits on where people can move if they have limited resources all of these three barriers public transportation information about new jobs and housing barriers keep the people from low income households from getting the jobs that are available far from home
1027246 given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children the fact that one in ten u s children is using one of these medications is striking
1027247 children who experience hostility abuse physical discipline and other aggressive behaviors by their parents are more likely to model that behavior in their peer relationships
1027248 children learn from their parents how to behave and interact with others
1027249 so if theyre learning about aggression and angry words at home they will tend to use these behaviors as coping mechanisms when they interact with their peers
1027250 the goal of the assessment should guide the choice of the assessment tools used and assessments that will have widespread effects should meet high standards of rigor and validity
1027251 for example using a standardized test with a sample of children in a program would be suitable if the goal was to determine whether the program is bringing children closer to national norms but if the purpose is to guide instruction within a specific classroom a nonstandardized assessment linked to the curriculum would be appropriate

1027260 we were prepared to welcome proposals for a long term relationship with a new substantial investor to help establish west brom as a successful premier league club
1027261 although no one has come forward the club have been planning more ambitiously and aggressively than ever before for the new season and we are very much looking forward to once again competing in the premier league
1027262 we said we would shut the door on this at the end of july because we did not want anything off the pitch impacting on the new season
1027263 it is a nonsense for anyone to suggest a transfer cannot be processed simply because i am not in attendance

1027277 billy is cool with set up a and set up b but he wants to know if you can move set up c to earlier
1027278 sure i can do that although if we move c to earlier than b has to be done first because we need the sun
1027279 billy said that is cool but he wants to know if you can move set up a from the side area to the load in area

1027281 cool let me run this by billy be right back

1027365 you are good about nagging me until i get things done
1027366 the vibrancy and intensity of your paintings has burnt images into my mind of emotions that i feel any audience could relate to a truly personal and yet fascinatingly universal insight into the human portrait
1027367 so much soul in these paintings all the faces look like i should know them
1027368 my friend luke likes the girl with the short blonde hair whos making excellent coffee his number is 07846 he would like you to call him please or text if youre shy
1027369 i find your paintings rather flat and unemotional and awkwardly composed all this can be resolved
1027370 its great to see all these still lifes which i havent seen before they intrigue me they deserve to be savoured over time ill be back
1027371 simon i can see you from your paintings just in case you dont know i mean your personality
1027372 i really like your attention to detail but you do it in a way that doesnt make it the most important thing in your work

1027395 if they had been conceived through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it
1027396 but we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems

1027398 take a helicopter tour of neighborhoods destroyed by obama and his friends
1027399 hard to get any help out there i hate it for bad boy his sponsor and bill davis
1027400 i really thought bill would help me because he is in i think jay frye or robyn pemberton would have helped us out there but i think frank stoddard use to work for bill davis so there must be some bad blood there
1027401 we didnt need that last caution if the caution didnt come out we are in but thats the way it goes you cant win them all i hate it weve had a good long run and we might be back next year to try it again
1027402 i am going to say that there is too many opportunities for failure here with this many good cars only showing up for seven spots with terry takes the past champions provisional so really eight spots the 150s have lost some of their fizz even though we have a good crowd here all it is is setting the starting field its not really getting the guys into the race
1027403 its too bad we are not in the daytona 500 its a shame the car went from really great to pretty bad right away i dont know if it was a slow leaking the tire going down or the car got so tight that i had to just get on that wheel and the tire gave out
1027404 its the biggest race in the world everybody is trying to get in and we are not lucky to get in theres always next year
1027405 that wasnt the only mistake we had we had the pit stop mistake we had the gear failure in qualifying so there were several things that had to line up circumstance wise for us to not make the race
1027406 that was a risk we came down here facing not having any owner points we knew this could happen looking back there were few mistakes we made as a team there were a lot of situations that did not work in our favor but when we walk out of this gate we hold our heads up high and we leave daytona behind and we look at how strong our team is and what kind of caliber people we are and we take the valvoline stanley tools dodge to california
1027407 what you do is you try to put yourself in position for those last 20 laps we did we just didnt have a fast enough race car thats all there is to it the cautions would kill me because my car wouldnt get up to speed on the restarts
1027408 it was good to score against milan in a good game but it is only a friendly game and i look forward to the beginning of the season
1027409 i am happy to score goals but more important will be portsmouth and i hope i can do the same then
1027410 it is great for the strikers and he has had a fantastic pre season scoring in almost every game four goals against ac milan is great for his confidence and it is good to know we have a striker with confidence

1027416 riddle me this riddle me that who is afraid of the big black bat
1027417 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
1027418 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
1027419 estimates of maximum bite force for t rex are around 3 1 tonnes greater than for a living white shark but puny compared to big tooth
1027420 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1027421 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
1027422 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
1027423 lynx is one species that is vulnerable but the potential impacts of climate change on entire ecosystems are even more alarming
1027424 having exclusively served baby boomers and the over 40 population for more than a decade we greatly value the importance of further understanding the generational make up of our visitors
1027425 although the majority of thirdagers are comprised of people between 44 and 66 traditionally regarded as boomers our audience in fact spans three different generations with people in their early 40s through early 70s many share the same values attitudes and behaviors however they also differ in many significant ways as a result of generational differences and events that happened during their formative years
1027426 drug disasters are literally built into the current system of drug testing and approvals in the united states
1027427 recent changes in the system have only increased the proportion of new drugs with serious risks
1027428 based on our current system the designation of safe and effective on todays new drugs could be replaced with apparently safe based on incomplete information and more effective than a placebo
1027429 speed up reviews for safety have more than tripled the number of black box warnings of side effects or withdrawals after drugs are on the market
1027430 despite recent reforms to strengthen the fdas role in protecting the public from harmful drugs the harm benefit ratio is worsening due to these reviews and relaxed rules that allow companies to promote drugs for unapproved uses
1027431 my nose was broken in about ten place and i fractured my cheek bone and i sprained my neck
1027432 every year in this country approximately 6 500 children are treated in emergency departments for diving related injury
1027433 more than 80 of the dive injuries were from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive thats not a platform dive this is the lowest dive height available at the pool
1027434 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
1027435 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
1027436 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
1027437 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question
1027438 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
1027439 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
1027440 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
1027441 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops
1027442 its not just matrix of natural areas with agriculture mixed in but a patchwork quilt with animals using all of the areas in the landscape
1027443 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1027444 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
1027445 people may not get a heart attack until their 50s or 60s but arteries begin to clog in childhood
1027446 most of these kids meals appear to be designed to put americas children on the fast track to obesity disability heart attack or diabetes
1027447 prefer card check because it means they know exactly how people are going to vote for anyone who doesnt agree with joining the union they are more open to threats intimidation and undue pressure by other co workers union organizers and even their supervisors workers can even be visited in their homes by union organizers so that the organizers can persuade workers that a union is the right thing to do in their workplace

1027452 this is a remote place and its already getting late send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food
1027453 they do not need to go away you give them something to eat
1027454 when you live in the moment and are in communication with god he does take care of your needs
1027455 and when you take care of yourself first and foremost the other parts of your life seem to fall into place
1027456 investing in yourself is the best investment you can make
1027457 well then god take away my depression give it to all those people eating fish and loaves or to the poor pigs that got the demons that jesus exorcised from a believer

1027470 tag readers that were 2 500 now are 900 and the tags that were 5 now are a buck fifty
1027471 we applaud the fcc for taking enforcement action against comcast
1027472 we commend free press public knowledge and the other groups who pursued the complaint against comcast we also applaud aclu activists and the public for speaking out at field hearings and sending in thousands of personal comments about comcasts illegal practices
1027473 todays fcc penalty against comcast is a step forward toward freedom on the net we urge the commissioners to remain vigorous in their defense of consumers rights and the open internet
1027474 kevin martin deserves credit in this case for leading the commission to limit comcasts abuse of the internet but commission decisions are only as permanent as the commissioners who voted for them and we are far from a point where we can all relax secure in the knowledge that the internet as we have always known it is safe more needs to be done soon power will change hands in washington and we urge party leaders to nominate fcc commissioners who will make it a priority to restore and protect network neutrality principles the aclu will continue to work towards legislation that will free the internet from corporate censorship and the fleeting policy decisions that accompany a commission filled with political appointees

1027476 after many years away i was exploring my own blood ties which include an ancestor named after union gen william tecumseh sherman by his slave owning yet unionist parents but also gauging the tenor of a region that has been critical to every u s presidential election since 1932 and may be again
1027477 if you dont win anything in the south you need 70 percent of the rest of the country
1027478 if you can win some of the south that gives you breathing space
1027479 a generation is growing up with traumas more immediate than those of the 1860s or the 1960s shana sprouse 21 and white and born and raised in spartanburg s c said shes going to vote for obama because her 26 year old boyfriend is racked with cancer and she and he have spent the last two years trying to find ways to pay for his treatment or now his hospice jobs are disappearing to places that are truly foreign not mock strange states like california new immigrants are introducing brown into a color map that has long been dominated by black and white there is a sense that a world is ending maybe not this year but inevitably
1027480 the election and obamas candidacy have focused these anxieties like a lens i found whites frustrated and indecisive about the campaign families at odds generations divided many who thought themselves beyond prejudice were surprised by their suspicions of the young black man from up north meanwhile many slave descended blacks hugely supportive of the half kenyan half kansan hawaii reared obama seemed afraid to hope too much inoculating themselves with pessimism about the chances that any man of color could win the presidency even this man even today or that if he does he will survive as i say emotions are raw
1027481 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1027482 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1027483 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1027484 for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1027485 as i said well make our decisions alans a contracted player
1027486 were not hiding anything we will take our time to consider our situation because theres nothing worse than making these decisions on the run unfortunately for us it has changed
1027487 the situation i think was that they were looking after alan after your paper slaughtered him last year
1027488 as a result of that thats compromised the decision making process during the day
1027489 they came to us and told us later that didak was in the car we are going to have a little bit of time to work through things and reconsider the situation
1027490 we have tried our best to be as honest as we can with everybody with the information that we had in front of us
1027491 and now that we have new evidence in front of us we will consider that and in the cool light of day and make a decision
1027492 it is time these guys grew up and took responsibility

1027494 coach mick malthouse breaks his neck week in and out and is dragged down by clowns enough is enough
1027495 he just gave us his details and was very co operative it was heath and alan didak in the car i wouldnt have guessed that they were over the limit
1027496 i recognised didak they said they swerved to avoid a possum he shaw did not look like he was really pissed
1027497 he wasnt near there but a short time after he was we were together then we went separate ways then i called him because i didnt really know what to do
1027498 the police have a statement about who was in the car the name of the person is a friend of heaths its not alan didak its no one associated with the club
1027499 after the strong decrease of the arctic ice during the last summer climate scientists all around the world are constantly asked how will the ice develop in the next years
1027500 to answer this question we did not want to guess but to rely on sound calculations
1027501 through this we are still not able to make a definitive statement on sea ice cover in september this trick enables us to compute the bandwidth of possible ice covers and to quantify the probability of extreme events
1027502 it is a first test and all participating researchers are eager to know how their prognosis has fared at the end of the summer in the end this small competition serves the optimisation of our models so that we are able to improve our predictions concerning short term seasonal fluctuations it has to be added however that even perfect models would not be able to rule out a component of chance regarding the atmosphere these forecasts will always be about probability and not exact prognoses
1027503 he has a solid financial control background and experience in insurance and financial services his knowledge of gaap and sec reporting for public companies and involvement with public offerings of securities and m amp a transactions should serve us well
1027504 i dont know how somebody who has been in this field so long could be so ignorant on the use of force standard

1027511 it is entirely a matter for her and her family to decide whether they will make a comment
1027512 it is clear in the short term paula will be unable to perform her duties as a minister
1027513 i saw paula suffer from lethargy confusion a degree of denial and profound sadness almost like grief
1027514 my first and only priority in these circumstances is paulas health and wellbeing and that of her family
1027515 these are kids its a swimming pool its not late at night you are a freak to ask this of me and i hate you

1027518 while the more important alcohol medication interactions are listed in the table it is not an exhaustive list
1027519 read the warning labels on the medication bottle if it says not to drink alcohol dont
1027520 but the absence of an alcohol warning sticker on the bottle is not an absolute guarantee that it is acceptable to drink alcohol
1027521 ample data exist leading to the conclusion that assisting people toward a higher quality of life involves success in education and economic opportunity
1027522 creating the power of many by combining resources of the public private and philanthropic sectors provides the best chance to achieve significant change

1027524 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
1027525 these people ar just rushing to get this money back to us
1027526 theyd probably make some type of stipulation where youd have to have a full african bloodline which stretches back to the slave trade

1027529 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory then his children are old enough to recognize the consequences
1027530 this guy knows what he is doing he knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences
1027531 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
1027532 we understand their frustration we understand why they are doing that sort of thing
1027533 we had so much fun making that movie and it was hard to get made
1027534 but what s been great is it s kind of taken on such a life of its own
1027535 the audience will now allow us to do even crazier stuff and thats really all were looking for in our careers

1027583 in the past solar energy was considered an alternative energy and it was relegated to a few rooftops or what we call
1027584 nothing remotely like this ever happened in the nine years i was receiving police protection
1027585 i simply wish to protect my reputation from a bunch of lies
1027586 the falsehoods relating to our client and his friends the various statements that invade their privacy and statements about security precautions that remain in place
1027587 what he has done is essentially given a road map for anybody to read who is maliciously inclined
1027588 people i respect and admire people who risked their lives to look after me have been defamed in this book
1027589 they never drank on duty they never went to the pub they never even accepted drinks when i went to the homes of my friends
1027590 it sticks in my throat to see them described as this bunch of drunken vindictive losers
1027591 wanting a big family is one of the things that brought brad and i together
1027592 when ange and i were told we were having twins we burst into hysterics we didnt see this one coming
1027593 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1027594 replaced at a later date so that we can get oil into the market
1027595 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1027596 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
1027597 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
1027598 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
1027599 its another example of short term political posturing from washington not the long term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil
1027600 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1027601 they said i need to come to a place on sunday morning where i dont experience
1027602 we are the church together another book that looks at interracial churches says whites often say that church should transcend race
1027603 theyd say cant we just get along without talking about race all the time
1027604 people said that if jews greeks africans slaves men and women the huge divides of that time period could come together successfully there must be something to this religion
1027605 everyone understands the rules the lingo the mind set except you
1027606 it was invaluable but i didnt know it at the time
1027607 the fear there was people would think i was chinese
1027608 there would be a flood of all these asians coming in and what would we do then
1027609 if theres not any tension we probably havent done too well
1027610 if one group feels too comfortable weve probably neglected another group
1027611 they didnt want their kids involved in interracial dating and thats not just whites
1027612 as long as the top person the senior pastor is white power sort of resides with whites
1027613 but when that shifts it does something psychologically to people people usually leave
1027614 a black church sermon that could be understood as impassioned might be interpreted as angry and defensive by a white congregation
1027615 taking one dominant identity and forcing everyone to fit into it

1027672 everyone agrees roadside litter is unsightly and clearing it up from the roadside takes up valuable resources that could be used elsewhere
1027673 we want everyone to help us keep englands roads clear by getting into the habit of keeping a bag in their vehicle to store their rubbish until they can find a bin for it
1027674 with rubbish theres no such place as away every piece of litter tossed onto the carriageway has to be picked up by someone
1027675 throwing litter onto the road is a filthy habit and theres no excuse its a waste of money which could be better spent on repairs and maintenance and its a safety hazard for everyone who has to dodge bags cans and bottles on the road

1027708 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails

1027715 weve introduced an energy management system in our department where our own staff are looking to see exactly how can we reduce our energy usage
1027716 i think its perfectly possible for us to make a one third saving in our energy use by employing really basic energy efficiency measures
1027717 we worry more about stray dogs and cats than we do about stray humans
1027718 thought congress had adjourned gop lawmakers to return for energy debate
1027719 curtailing speech is generally far more dangerous than allowing even vile views to be aired not least by a cantankerous has been like sin
1027720 over a week went by between the insult at once racist and sexual in its evocation of crinkle haired whores and the ouster time enough for a number of middle aged white guys to opine that imus had been a careless idiot was contrite and should keep his job some people never get it
1027721 on our route there seems to be an issue with tent space and my concern is when i can go up for a summit push
1027722 there now appears to be six climbers including me wanting to reach the top and there is only room for well five climbers
1027723 so if i want to go up on the first push i have to carry another tent which makes things unnecessarily hard
1027724 this is dissapointing sic so maybe it is best for me to wait for the first party and go another two days past
1027725 two dutch climbers were brought by our people and their colleagues down to base camp from an altitude of 7300m overnight
1027726 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
1027727 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
1027728 badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
1027729 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
1027730 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300m cliff
1027731 the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too many inexperienced and naive people
1027732 we worry more about stray dogs and cats than we do about stray humans
1027733 one of the biggest scandals in american history has already sent one member of congress to jail others into retirement and dozens of accomplices running for cover
1027734 carry out mr abramoffs requests for help with his clients in exchange for cash payments
1027735 concludes that mr abramoff had personal contact with president bush that high level white house officials held mr abramoff and his associates in high regard and solicited recommendations from them on policy matters that mr abramoff and his associates influenced some white house actions and that mr abramoff and his associates offered white house officials expensive tickets and meals
1027736 offering a refreshing alternative to the flip flops and baby doll dresses that had become de rigueur
1027737 we know that there will continue to be challenges but hopefully at days end we will prevail
1027738 epas irresponsible inappropriate decision has failed navajo communities and needlessly sacrificed our air land and water
1027739 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
1027740 at best youre looking at five years or more down the road and even the most optimistic assumptions indicate that offshore drilling might reduce the overall world price of oil by a few cents
1027741 we can do this in ways that are consistent with sensible standards of environmental protection
1027742 i dont think its our optimal energy source because we havent figured out how to store the waste safely or recycle the waste
1027743 if were looking for a vast supply of reliable and low cost electricity with zero carbon emissions and long term stability thats the working definition of nuclear energy
1027744 lets give low income americans a break for the summer and realize maybe they deserve it given the increase in food costs given the increase in the cost of gasoline given the increase in expenses particularly when most of them are on fixed income or even worse having lost their jobs
1027745 the amounts were very very very small and were not of the sort that would affect the human body or the environment
1027746 the claim that the us navys nuclear powered vessels are safe and are not susceptible to radiation leaks has completely broken down
1027747 but seeing as we couldnt rule it out we notified the government of japan
1027748 it was a very minute amount and there was never any danger to the reactor of the ship or to the crew of the ship or for that matter to the public
1027749 were talking about an extremely minute amount of radiation its about half as much radiation as you would find in a 50 pound bag of fertiliser
1027750 for some months we have been communicating to customers the message that as well as being a cheaper alternative we can lower their carbon footprint
1027751 for a long time the railroads have been able to claim they are more efficient but the fact they produce fewer emissions as well is a formidable marketing tool
1027752 the carbon footprint issue is frosting on the cake for the railroads
1027753 in the course of just a few years environmentalism has become mainstream
1027754 reducing carbon footprints and emissions has gone from a fringe element to a major topic of discussion
1027755 but there is a lot more they could do lower their footprint even further
1027756 there is plenty of room to reduce idling and they could invest more in engines with lower emissions
1027757 but to be fair that is a part of a much broader national energy debate
1027758 in the past shippers have been reluctant to move freight to trains from the highway because they are slower and less reliable
1027759 but the price differential is now so wide that they are reexamining trains as an option
1027760 for decades we have tried to ship as many packages as we can by rail as long as that allows us to meet our service commitments
1027761 but although there is clearly a demand for electric cars the only way for them to become a viable option is to have a sufficient infrastructure in place
1027762 what weve shown for the first time is that its possible to use these cells to make the actual cell type thats destroyed in this disease
1027763 the disparity in the numbers is indeed hard to reconcile as photojournalists we always strive to be fair we have tried to be balanced but it seems that in a large operation such as ours we need to monitor the use of political images even more closely
1027764 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
1027765 this has really fueled my passion for this type of work
1027766 i always wanted to do something like this and now that i have i realize theres so much more to see and do there are so many organizations out there to work with
1027767 from travelling on the river and going to one of the most remote places in peru
1027768 it gives me a whole new appreciation for the importance of conserving these places
1027769 i dont like to think about that part of it
1027770 im normally the type of person who makes sure my cigarettes are doubted maybe i was too careless this time i really dont know
1027771 ninety five percent of our efforts will be focused on what happens on the field and in the locker room
1027772 there is good drama with these characters and there are arresting personalities from the administration down to the field
1027773 from an individual point of view the joy of battle reaction is probably counter survival
1027774 so youre saying its x linked like homosexuality is theorized to be
1027775 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
1027776 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
1027777 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
1027778 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
1027779 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
1027780 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
1027781 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
1027782 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
1027783 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
1027784 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
1027785 no youre a woman we are looking for a man
1027786 he just raped a woman and he is driving a car just like yours same color
1027787 not that ill be able to get involved as its not really my sphere and i dont appear to have a whole lot of time
1027788 things are going either moderately badly or very badly in iraq
1027789 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice republican congressional revolt guerilla congress live updates
1027790 on august 1st the house of representatives voted to go home for five weeks without passing legislation to address the current energy crisis all but 2 of 199 republicans voted against adjournment but enough democrats voted yes for the motion to pass by one vote in response to the failure of the democratic house to pass meaningful energy legislation and allow full access to americas petroleum deposits a half dozen members of the republican conference refused to go home even though the microphones and cameras had been turned off they remained on the house floor discussing the matter with excited citizens in the gallery and debating energy policy

1027793 oppenheimers meredith whitney notes this would reduce mers cdos exposure by 11 1 billion while mer has significantly diluted existing shareholders they applaud this purging of assets as an attempt to cut its losses and focus on stabilizing its platform and righting the franchise towards growth while mers stock still sells at a premium to book value and is expensive in firms opinion they believe the stock is getting closer to fairly valued levels as now the hardest work is behind the company
1027794 bad governance corruption and murders implemented as a way of management by members of the current government and representatives of state bodies with the blessing of the countrys authorities
1027795 its difficult to explain when its this close to the olympics
1027796 the hamstring feels good now but when i play it cramps i feel its too big of a risk when you dont have too many players in the squad and you dont have that many options and you know that one is down it makes it hard on the whole team
1027797 she could be ready in 3 4 days or a week or two or more
1027798 she has an extreme feel for the ball she doesnt need one two or three chances to score she scores when she gets a chance
1027799 its not neighborly to be dumping so much waste that it stinks up the countryside for over half a mile
1027800 so strong that it gave me a headache and made me nauseous
1027801 we do understand peoples concerns we want to be a good neighbor and it is costing us a considerable amount of money to find other solutions around this
1027802 i want to stress this isnt normal business practice this is not something we wanted to do

1027811 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1027812 its true that obama doesnt take money directly from oil companies but then no presidential house or senate candidate does they cant corporations have been prohibited from contributing directly to federal candidates since the tillman act became law in 1907
1027813 does accept donations from oil company employees and he has two oilmen working as bundlers for the campaign collecting donations
1027814 we faulted him earlier for a tv ad in which he claimed i dont take money from oil companies in fact he does accept donations from oil company employees and he has two oilmen working as bundlers for the campaign collecting donations
1027815 the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations
1027816 obama is cherry picking here the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations yes exxon mobil but also to wal mart general motors and home depot to name a few of the other fortune 50 biggies even everybodys favorite starbucks would get the same tax break obamas statement is technically true but singling out oil companies suggests mccain has targeted oil companies for tax breaks he hasnt we rate obamas statement and the claim in the ad barely true
1027817 a lower corporate tax rate is essential to keeping good jobs in the united states america was once a low tax business environment but as our trade partners lowered their rates america failed to keep pace we now have the second highest corporate tax rate in the world making america a less attractive place for companies to do business american workers deserve the chance to make fine products here and sell them around the globe
1027818 proposed a cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies
1027819 mccains economic plan includes a proposed cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies not just oil companies
1027820 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
1027821 when asked about the claims that john mccain was in the pocket of big oil romney scoffed at obamas demonization of both the industry and of mccain and pointed out that obama takes money from the exact same source he decries in the ad
1027822 he brown will admit that the girl was assaulted and died as a result of a brain haemorrhage but my instructions are that the blood that was found on his jacket belonged to that of a sheep
1027823 his explanation for her blood found on his jacket resulted from the girl suffering from a nosebleed a week before the incident and the accused will say he carried her home because it was a very hot day
1027824 that evening he brown came home and he was very drunk he started shouting at me and hitting me then he pulled my baby child off my back i was so afraid i fled to my aunts place
1027825 when i asked him where asiba was he told me she was still at home i immediately went to our house and a little boy ran out into the street and told me my daughter was lying next to the road
1027826 i went to her and could see my child was dead

1027828 the buyers agent also needs to have an incentive and our company recognizes it prices have dropped and the glut of homes is forcing good homes to languish this program will always set the bar higher for those homes in the 25g program
1027829 if i was a buyer and my agent showed 2 similar homes id buy the 25g house if that was the only difference
1027830 the reality of the matter is gold fields wished to move the 2050 workers from south deep to some other operations such as kloof and beatrix
1027831 it is therefore inaccurate to argue that gold fields intends dismissing employees the num has repeatedly fought and will continue to fight against any form of retrenchment
1027832 all the retrenchments at south deep are completely voluntary 1885 workers need to be made redundant because the area of the mine at which they are working has been depleted
1027833 gold fields came to an agreement with the unions on july 22 to create a monitoring committee to oversee retrenchments and review each and every application for retrenchment

1027844 cwu and sacu welcomed the revised offer from telkom but will not accept anything below the inflation rate which was at 11 6 percent
1027845 in response we also presented them with our revised demands of 11 6 percent effective from april 1 2008 to march 31 2009 and a further 1 percent effective from october 1 2008 to march 31 2009
1027846 the company agreed not to apply the no work no pay rule for the three days the workers were on stayaway

1027855 the priests did not ask where is the lord those who deal taphas with the law did not know me the leaders rebelled against me the prophets prophesied by baal following worthless idols
1027856 and the lord spoke to moses saying speak to the children of israel and say to them if any mans wife goes astray and behaves unfaithfully toward him and a man lies shakab with her carnally and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and it is concealed that she has defiled herself and there was no witness against her nor was she caught

1027864 this influx indelibly altered the demographics of american jewry according to the u s census of 1940 1 75 million jews spoke yiddish at home
1027865 the possibility that some anglicans will ask to be received into the catholic church
1027866 our hope is that schisms or new fractures can be avoided and that a solution can be found that responds both to the needs of our time and also to fidelity to the gospel these two things must go together christianity is always contemporary and lives in this world in a given time but it makes present in this time the message of jesus christ and therefore it offers a true contribution for this time only by being faithful in a mature way in a creative way thats faithful to the message of christ
1027867 this is my buddy the beloved with whom i am well pleased
1027868 how often do you receive a definite answer to a specific prayer request
1027869 god has arranged the body and that there may not be disagreements inside the body but that each part may be equally concerned for all the others
1027870 god has so composed the body giving the greater honor to the inferior part that there may be no discord in the body but that the members may have the same care of one another if one member suffers all suffer together if one member is honored all rejoice together
1027871 god has so constructed the body as to give greater honor to the part that is without it so that there may be no division in the body but that the parts may have the same concern for one another if one part suffers all the parts suffer with it if one part is honored all the parts share its joy
1027872 now you together are christs body but each of you is a different part of it

1027882 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea and worry about the price of arugula
1027883 i saw a blog that cited obamas preference for organic bottled tea as an indication that he had elitist tastes
1027884 a man is judged by his deeds not by his words
1027885 some people say he is not focusing enough on white working class voters as he has promised
1027886 the black guy is damned if he does and damned if he doesnt you all really didnt think we were going to make it easy for a brother did you

1027894 how to do it on blogspot when you set up your blog you answer a bunch of questions for the settings you have the choice of making the blog searchable password accessable and linkable i chose to make my private blog nonsearchable and nonlinkable but not password accessable you can also set it so that you provide the e mails of the people you want to have access layers of protection
1027895 spending less on luxury goods and are being more thrifty with their credit cards
1027896 the problem is that when the wealthy get stingy it trickles down do the rest of us
1027897 we are living water ministries and we are the host site for angel food ministries
1027898 angel food ministries is based out of monroe ga living water is a local ministry hoping to make a difference with people and food
1027899 angel food ministries provides a box of food usually with 17 or 18 items of food in it there are fresh items frozen items and canned items
1027900 this month we have a box of fresh produce with carrots onions watermelon pineapple and potatoes
1027901 and we have other specials such as a full box of chicken tenders steaks and things like that
1027902 canned foods will be good for two or three years after the expiration date
1027903 what i have been told is that the food starts to lose some of its nutritional value after the date and the nutrition chart on the can is no longer a guarantee but the food only loses about 1 or 2 percent of its nutrition each year
1027904 we try to stock up around the end of the month because a lot of seniors will be coming here around the beginning of the month when their social security checks come in
1027905 they will come here first before they go to local retail food stores
1027906 we can order large quantities for our customers as long as it is something we usually order
1027907 we have a woman who comes in once or twice a month and orders 100 pounds of wheat kernel she grinds it into flour and bakes her own bread
1027908 in order to make people who are really interested in living a nontoxic lifestyle we have combined our retail store with a co op its called the mcdp the managed co op discount program
1027909 for somebody to get 17 percent off from what they buy for us they can get it in exchange for eight hours of work a month
1027910 there are no minimums or maximums and they can come in any time of the month and order
1027911 somebody should be willing to do their own cooking and make things from scratch to really take advantage of buying in bulk
1027912 that makes the most sense and makes the best use of the food if someone doesnt know how to cook or doesnt have the time they can buy many things by the case that would be cans of soup beans things like that
1027913 there are some things coming together that should be disturbing to everyone
1027914 there are folks in ohio and around the country whose standard of living is changing because of high gasoline prices
1027915 that doesnt include 200 billion weve borrowed from the trust fund
1027916 so the deficit this year will be about 750 billion our national debt at the end of the year will probably be 10 trillion
1027917 were taking 600 billion and sending it overseas in many instances to people who dont like us including venezuela in effect these people control the price of something that is essential to our economy
1027918 since 2001 we have seen 70 percent of our national debt picked up by china japan and the opec nations
1027919 so from a national security point of view folks we are in real jeopardy
1027920 there is no reason why this country cant become the least reliant on foreign oil
1027921 we need to take advantage of the resources we have currently before us
1027922 we have 800 billion barrels of oil out in the west today but we are not even able to pass regulations to go after it
1027923 in my opinion if this country really made up its mind to go after all of the stuff that we can go after wed be at the top of the barrel rather than the bottom of the barrel
1027924 i think if the rest of the world knew we had a policy of going after what we have it would send a ripple around the world
1027925 just as we need a full court press dealing with oil in this country we need to put that same commitment toward wind solar nuclear clean coal and natural gas
1027926 to personalize or not to personalize modeling queries with variation in user intent
1027927 the mob turned very violent and started pelting police with stones
1027928 protesters outnumbered the police and tried to encircle them forcing them to open fire
1027929 how it ended up touching the wires whether a piece of equipment failed and it slipped and touched the wires or whether the act of jacking it up higher on one side caused it to touch we just dont know yet
1027930 the suspect slaughtered their dog and threw it out of their home and onto the street and proceeded to kill the woman totally severing her head
1027931 the attacker walked around the village carrying the head of the victim in one hand and the cleaver in the other
1027932 the court would like to find out the real issues before some irreversible acts can be done
1027933 we are experiencing congestion on our mobile network in pockets of sydney brisbane and melbourne and some outlying areas we are working to resolve the issue and apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused

1027935 when everyday is a sh gfest how could we possibly we work it out ourselves

1027937 this is my 10th fair i love it i look forward to it every year
1027938 i love watching it go up and when they tear it down its like a depression
1027939 but then you start getting ready for the next one
1027940 theres a lot of things that are set that stay the same every year but when people start showing up thats when everything changes
1027941 a lot of the stages and tents we set every year but every year somebody new will be in charge and will want to do something different and have different ideas
1027942 were setting up stages all over the fairgrounds we probably set up 12 to 15 different stages weve been setting up 4 h displays which is quite a bit of work for us
1027943 were busy all year long but we really get busy july 1
1027944 what you see out now has to be put away its as much work picking it up and putting it away and finding a place to store it as it is to put it out
1027945 if i am re elected you will see a big change here in our state in five years you will be just blown away
1027946 this started out as a legitimate claim and it was an innocent mistake

1027949 they had the large population the industrial living you had three and four families living in a dwelling
1027950 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
1027951 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
1027952 people come down to get fresh ingredients and unique stuff and just to walk around
1027953 pittsburgh is a community town and thats why everybody that lives here loves it
1027954 pittsburgh isnt the type of town that you go to that has strip malls
1027955 i wanted to grow my hair long and stop wearing suits
1027956 culinary tours are really offered everywhere all of the big cities
1027957 so it was just a matter of time that pittsburgh needed to offer it as well
1027958 i blame myself a lot for not being able to identify the threat simply because of the way i heard the shots
1027959 in the four months before the attack the chief physician at fort hood texas had warned that dunnes hearing was so bad that he should be removed from combat duties others in the army overruled him and sent dunne back to iraq for his third combat tour
1027960 as much as i wanted to get out there im seriously physically challenged by not being able to hear
1027961 the guys to my left and right dont deserve anything to happen to them because of my personal pride
1027962 within a few months after his consecration bishop oconnor had ordained six priests for his diocese became the american founder of a new religious community established a newspaper operated a seminary with 12 students had more than 10 seminarians waiting to be brought over from europe and had contracted for the construction of seminary facilities with an episcopal residence attached
1027963 a broader answer is persistent pseudonymity a system of nicknames that stay the same across multiple sites this could reduce anonymitys excesses while preserving its benefits for whistle blowers and overseas dissenters

1027968 balfour feels that it would set a wrong precedent for him to meet the family of a convict because it means that anybody could just arrange a meeting with him
1027969 he wants them to follow the proper channels if they have a problem or concern then they must raise it with the local correctional services office and not him
1027970 we will no longer comment about schabirs health his life or his imprisonment
1027971 i cant say whether its true or not we just want the media to leave us alone schabir is in jail under the keep of correctional services
1027972 we sent our medical doctor and we received a report studied it and took a decision based on that report
1027973 after meeting with shaik we want to speak to the minister of correctional services ngconde balfour to discuss pardoning shaik from his sentence because of his ill health
1027974 at the time that shaik was sentenced president thabo mbeki granted all prisoners a 20 month amnesty that would effectively shorten their time in prison shaik was not sentenced by judge hilary squires until after this but he should also benefit from this amnesty
1027975 inflicted heavy losses to various sectors of the national economy including agriculture and to the peoples living
1027976 we have two but a lot of times we dont have enough people to run them
1027977 in some communities out there its the volunteer fire department or nothing
1027978 theres not the economic base to support a career department so if they cant keep the volunteer fire department viable then the potential exists that theyre not going to have any protection at all
1027979 your mom and your dad was in the fire service and their parents were in the fire service and it just goes on from generation to generation
1027980 it makes you wonder where well be 20 years from now
1027981 every time i hear the pager go off you know you wonder whos gonna be there and whos not
1027982 sometimes you just dont have anybody to go especially during the day
1027983 i hate to admit it but theres been more times this year where other departments have had to help us out

1027995 the talks were on today monday after they resumed on sunday
1027996 we should take note of the fact that the parties took five days off last week to discuss with their principals so logically there is no way they will meet their original deadline if you take that into consideration
1027997 our completion of prototype development has advanced our thin film escitalopram oxalate product to the clinical investigation stage of the project
1027998 our thin film formulation of escitalopram oxalate is one of the companys self funded initiatives designed to capitalize on our capacity to develop and manufacture thin film prescription products at commercial scale for a large pharmaceutical partner as blockbuster drugs lose exclusivity pharmaceutical companies are exploring alternative dosing formulations as differentiators from generic entrants we also believe that our pharmfilm r technology offers an attractive opportunity to extend product revenue life cycles the validity of our technology has been established by our over the counter drug product introductions and other prescription pharmaceutical partnerships including the recently announced licensing of our thin film formulation of ondansetron an anti emetic therapy to strativa pharmaceuticals a division of par pharmaceuticals our expectation is to partner our pharmfilm r escitalopram oxalate product with a pharmaceutical company that is competitively positioned in this market

1028021 because we cater for a wider range of body shapes than most designer labels sizes 36 44 the design of the garment is actually very technical it must be able to work in all these sizes
1028022 you need to show a sort of stability over a couple of seasons maintaining a recognisable aesthetic while still being innovative is key
1028023 as a new label we cannot have multiple lines so within a single collection we are dividing it into two parts on the more fashion forward side we have beautiful dresses and other pieces that are worn by celebrities and are featured in magazines the other half of the collection is commercial wearable and appeals to a womans everyday lifestyle

1028037 we have listened carefully to the views of licence holders and come up with a set of proposals that will lead to a significant reduction in cost and bureaucracy
1028038 currently around 30 of applications for variations can be classified as minor so these changes will make a big difference
1028039 there is no denying that times are tough now but they will be good again smart operators who diligently keep their business in order through regular stocktaking and auditing in bad and good times always maximise their profits and are suitably positioned to take maximum advantage whatever the market conditions the current tough times for many will result in a most opportune time for those who are diligent

1028042 its my home i am from africa and i live in america so i exist on an atlantic rock i grew up in the middle of the atlantic that is the story the beginning the end and the middle
1028043 my inspiration is african people especially african women particularly african women in america they work hard and sometimes are barely acknowledged
1028044 i want to educate the world about us and us about us
1028045 i just wanted to write for as far back as i can remember
1028046 i started writing poetry first and then i found out about open mics by the third one i got on stage
1028047 the african in america i live in the middle of the atlantic standing in the middle of sacred waters eyes on america hands lifting africa high and mighty im the face of 2 worlds somewhere between rockets to the moon camels across deserts where extreme poverty meets excessive indulgence one foot in the past the other in the future i am the present that will forever remain an enigma comprehensible to few
1028048 if people want to take me home they can do that
1028049 this is not just a bunch of poems put together like the title implies this is an africa to america story the big story here is my story its our africans in america story i always write for my people africans in america these are our stories but i think others will benefit highly from it too its a small world out there and i truly believe we should all do our best to see through our neighbors eyes so yeah though i think africans in america will get it the most i believe any and everyone should read it and try to understand it at the very least it might give them the right questions to ask
1028050 i want africans to say whoa im not the only one living this i also want you to learn something you didnt already know

1028054 it was probably one of my worst races but weve come away still looking pretty good
1028055 at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so i cant complain
1028056 cooke is a good player but as a club he doesnt interest us and we dont want him
1028057 i saw a few games last season and ive heard a few things about how well doncaster played last year from a few people especially in terms of how they play football
1028058 im glad to be a part of it it was an easy decision to make and being an ex player of richard okelly who had me in the youth team at west brom it was even easier
1028059 his situation is personal to him but he is in the group at the minute and he is still included
1028060 i havent had a conversation with anybody from bolton and id be surprised if anybody else has
1028061 you never say never to anyone new coming in but if we dont sign anyone it looks like people may be happy with what we have
1028062 ill keep looking but weve only got seven days and a lot has to happen for that person to come in and do enough to play in the first game
1028063 im not one for setting targets but i think it is realistic for us to look at getting into that top bracket after the way we finished last time
1028064 if we aim to get above 10th place then anyone above that has a chance of making the play off places
1028065 i saw a few games last season and ive heard a few things about how well doncaster played last year from a few people especially in terms of how they play football
1028066 im glad to be a part of it it was an easy decision to make and being an ex player of richard okelly who had me in the youth team at west brom it was even easier
1028067 its serious and its the worst news we could have
1028068 he has at the very least torn his interior ligament
1028069 he just took and extra touch inside the box and it gave the defender time to get back and block a tackle and he may have tweaked a ligament in his knee but we will know more when we get him looked at today
1028070 it is a strange one with clinton but fingers crossed he is going to be with us for the next month and within that month we hope to do something with him
1028071 but i am pleased to say he is going to be with us for the start of the season
1028072 i havent had a conversation with anybody from bolton and id be surprised if anybody else has
1028073 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1028074 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1028075 im racing unless my leg breaks down its the olympics so you take a risk on it
1028076 i am happy to be here and get this far and im looking forward to starting the marathon
1028077 wait and be patient and all will soon be well
1028078 the concept of leadership has been bastardized in nigeria people now use leadership positions to show arrogance oppress others and misappropriate resources meant for the generality of nigerians instead of serving them as directed by god
1028079 de beers is disappointed by and strongly refutes the recent statement from african diamonds regarding the ak6 diamond deposit
1028080 de beers is the worlds leading diamond mining company with more that 100 years of experience in building and operating diamond mines in southern africa and more than 40 years in botswana specifically de beers has operated more diamond mines than any company in history
1028081 demonstrates a worrying lack of experience with diamond distribution and valuation
1028082 no decisions on fact or law have yet been made
1028083 having looked at the dtc valuation i believe it is both appropriate and accurate and i am comfortable that my valuation is correct for the carats i had been asked to value
1028084 the transfer window closing will probably be the time to get ourselves into that situation but were very relaxed about it because we honour contracts in this part of the world
1028085 weve been focused on pre season trying to bring players in my situation is not the priority
1028086 i couldnt agree with chairman niall quinn more its not important
1028087 my distance control and my irons were good and i thought i handled the pressure pretty good
1028088 when i get into contention and play in the last group i feel very comfortable out there now
1028089 ive heard nothing from stoke im at a huge club here and its really going places
1028090 you can see the players weve brought in and i think theyre a sign of some big things happening at the football club
1028091 in the past maybe id have let that get to me but now im playing top players on a regular basis and im better equipped
1028092 he picked up a calf strain yesterday and hes very disappointed
1028093 ive heard nothing from stoke im at a huge club here and its really going places
1028094 you can see the players weve brought in and i think theyre a sign of some big things happening at the football club
1028095 didier will not play in our first game against portsmouth and will probably miss the second against wigan
1028096 if there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that
1028097 but when you have a knee injury you just never know
1028098 robbie wasnt happy about not being first choice in the team
1028099 i was not particularly happy the way he reacted in training so like every other player no different if you dont want to do your best at training are not prepared to knuckle down you wont be considered
1028100 if robbie comes back monday morning and knuckles down he will be considered like everybody else no different to any other player at derby county
1028101 your father was in the civil service for over 40 years as a security guard in several government agencies and he retired with his honour intact there wasnt even a single incident of theft where he worked
1028102 it was god who did it for me and he will surely grant you that same luck but then people werent as greedy and dishonest then as they are these days people feared god and the various deities of their ethnic groups and were afraid to put any foot wrong and incur the displeasure of god and their deities also we were afraid of bringing disgrace to our families by stealing most people would rather starve or even die than do that any disgrace brought to the family stuck forever nowadays stealing is glorified whatever its form
1028103 remember where youre coming from and dont allow things to get missing were poor but we have our own house and we dont owe anybody youre an honest man but people may bring you trouble keep the books very well and watch your colleagues constantly
1028104 above all dont womanize or take peoples girls o otherwise they could cause trouble for you when its time come and marry your own wife o
1028105 papa youll have to come with us to the police station
1028106 what my sons not a thief he wasnt brought up that way
1028107 papa were respecting your age o keep your mouth shut were not here for argument if your son wasnt guilty why did he run away when all we wanted was to take him to the station so that he could tell us what he knew about the loss where is he
1028108 okay then well have to hold you until he turns up come with us
1028109 this is welcome news but are our law enforcement agencies going to pay attention and respect the law
1028110 the impression one gets from stories heard is that they are not in the know of all these laws which are in favour of the rights of our citizens
1028111 they need constant refresher courses so that they can be abreast of these laws im sure many of them would want to respect the rights of our citizens if they know that there are laws protecting those rights after all their own relatives could be affected serious knowledge of the upgrading of laws and human rights is important to all law enforcing agencies right down to those who serve at grassroots level by the very fact that theyre law enforcing agents they should know our laws more than the average citizen on the street
1028112 in exchange for its payout at amp t got a year extension into 2010 on its exclusive distribution deal with apple people familiar with the matter say sources asked to not be named because the terms are confidential
1028113 at amp t has exclusive u s distribution rights for five years an eternity in the go go cellphone world
1028114 it is a nonsense for anyone to suggest a transfer cannot be processed simply because i am not in attendance
1028115 terms had been agreed with the player but we were still not in a position to complete the deal at that time
1028116 however the player and his representatives did not return the following day and we were later informed that he had decided to join rangers
1028117 were letting them know that letting them know if they dont feel safe in a fema trailer or a camper
1028118 they should already be prepared since were already a month into the hurricane season
1028119 a john grisham novel becomes a crappy movie a gabriel garcia marquez novel becomes a crappy film
1028120 its a movie if its male lead is hurled through plate glass its a film if its male lead has sexual urges for young boys his sister or his mother
1028121 its a movie if its preceded by a trailer for the latest jerry bruckheimer epic
1028122 a trifecta of macro valuation and capital structure concerns that are likely to weight on the shares near term
1028123 we expect the company to be able to refinance as the business should be stronger and credit markets hopefully no worse that recent days when xm refinanced 1 25 billion of debt for the merger
1028124 satellite radio is obviously discretionary a clear headwind in a weakening economy
1028125 the lower than expected subscriber tallies suggest that satellite radio is resonating less with consumers than we had expected

1028150 we had a batting cage in our backyard in bonita
1028151 we had a chair in back for the strike zone if the ball hit it then it was a strike we played a lot in that cage and at first we kind of split the games they were pretty even
1028152 then adrian developed this pitch i think he started reading about it behind my back about how to throw it this pitch it started out behind my back and actually landed in the strike zone i couldnt hit it from then on he won most of the games all because of that one pitch
1028153 if i didnt feel like working out one day he would push me and if he didnt feel like he wanted to work out i would push him
1028154 we were pushing each other all the time we still are
1028155 its basically a dream come true for everyone baseball is our life my family has had an air conditioning business across the border for the last 33 years my dad has always said that we know two things air conditioning and baseball
1028156 his work ethic and perseverance made him a role model for me
1028157 even when we were in mexico they had a big room where they would play ball
1028158 we would make a baseball out of paper put tape on it and use a little bat and play we would pick our teams and whoever won went on to play the next guy
1028159 i learned pretty quickly that i couldnt take it easy with them
1028160 my dad would take us all to the park i would play shortstop edgar would play second base and adrian would be at first base adrian was younger so every time that we would throw the ball to first wed take it easy on him he got mad and told us to throw harder
1028161 hes been a huge part in the amount of runs weve scored without him i dont know where we would be
1028162 hes played pretty much every day hes been tremendous with the power the rbis the defense hes been an all star performer no doubt hes been our best player
1028163 his work ethic and perseverance made him a role model for me
1028164 i understood the politics of baseball once i got to a higher level i saw where people werent always where they deserved to be its not always about the most talented or the right player but who the organization picked higher
1028165 i think one of the things that helped him was having adrian move at a faster pace in the minor leagues and then to the major leagues
1028166 i think that it was his competitive edge that made edgar so driven knowing that he could play at that same level as adrian
1028167 i played with him in winter ball and in the offseason you can see a swing thats going to be successful and one thats not hes always had that
1028168 it has been a lot of fun its something weve dreamed about were enjoying every minute of it
1028169 he came to me one day and said it means a lot to me if you could answer this question do you believe that ive told the truth i told him i believe you donaghy told us the truth
1028170 i really know today how much racing means to me i feel differently toward it than i did when i was so burned out from 19 years straight i love it this is where my friends are this is where i belong
1028171 we need to improve the race setup just a little bit if we do that we can try to put ourselves in position to be a contender

1028174 we were just playing and trying to do the best we could
1028175 to be successful over an extended period of time youre going to need the minor league system to be strong
1028176 but first and foremost theyve got to be able to produce
1028177 i think the organizations shown a great deal of passion for the minor league system
1028178 theyre committed to development and hopefully we can help this team win after all theyve done for us
1028179 we still see racing as a significant return on our investment and thats why were still in it
1028180 were still in the planning stages for the future but as it looks right now well be in the sport

1028205 casey was a huge part of our team he was a guy when early in the season we werent scoring a lot of runs who was a key part of our offense kotch is a really good player but i dont think you can say its not an upgrade
1028206 theres definitely a feeling in the clubhouse similar to the second half of that 02 season
1028207 we felt we were going to win every time we went out there its a fun feeling to have
1028208 it definitely helps that weve got a nice mix veteran guys who have the track records kind of leading some of the young guys who have talent its cool here its definitely a good feeling in the clubhouse
1028209 id heard nothing but good things about him and hes been even better than i expected hes great in the clubhouse and on the field he gets after it theres definitely something there with the guy

1028225 the whole enterprise of writing poetry is a de facto folly
1028226 these people devote days to single lines and years to preparing each slim collection and then publish their work into a yawning maw of indifference
1028227 it has a distinct personality does not seem as impersonal as many other cities and has a heavily mixed ethnic population
1028228 in terms of neighborhoods and cultures and races and literary preferences
1028229 i thought if we find each other maybe we can make it a stronger community
1028230 hinges on the ability of poets to get out into the open and read because thats really their only public forum
1028231 i think that there is a genuine quality of here in terms of the raw versus the cooked they may tend to be more of the raw type less tutored in the ways of poetry than their academic peers but sometimes i find that preferable to listening to the drone of perfectly formed poetry in the academy
1028232 were interested in whatever we get as long as it seems to us to be well written and original particularly if it has a sound that we havent quite heard before
1028233 it brought in more of the spoken word element and a little bit of performance but the most exciting part of it was the fact that it was the first time and really the only time that there was a crossover between black and white poetry in this town it was an extraordinary opportunity to broach that self prescribed separateness these invisible boundaries in our city
1028234 but i think its because people are either unaware that there are other things going on or theyve found a spot that they are comfortable with and they stick there
1028235 everybody has their own clique even within the black community white poets might not feel as accepted in a black venue because the poetic language is slightly different
1028236 theres more variety ages styles and part of that is because of the internet theres a greater ability to let people know instantly about readings i dont get much of a sense of attitude here the slam poets the academic poets spoken word artists formalists language poets i think everyone accepts everyone else which really is the way it ought to be
1028237 i totally surrender that to god i believe in a god who can do all things but if he chooses not to give me arms and legs i know its for the better and i may not understand it but all i need to know is that hes going to carry me through that there is a purpose for it

1028243 i thought we had a helluva shot turning for home i thought to myself we could do this again i am very happy right now we made him run thats for sure big brown looked great in the paddock and when he broke but down the backside i got excited coal play ran a big race

1028257 because of reductions in staff and space the sunday real estate section has printed its final edition
1028258 theres a journalism term for finishing an editions work you put the section to bed when i started as a part timer in this department under then editor dick turpin i never dreamed that one day id be putting the section to bed for good
1028259 it was informative plenty of question and answer columns for renters condo and home owners presented the facts and provided some entertainment
1028260 im more of a news business sports guy so i didnt read the real estate section
1028261 but i am disturbed by the prospect of some of our big city papers being dramatically downsized or going away the internet is great at distributing other peoples content but not so much at originating it papers like the l a times imperfect though they may be still frequently play an important role in keeping our other institutions honest
1028262 im probably not going to miss the real estate section the only thing i ever read in the real estate section was the story of how some self absorbed celebrity is selling his mansion for 10 million which was always curiously 8 million more than similar sized homes in the same area
1028263 theyre not going to accept anymore syndicated material theres not anywhere to put it
1028264 i had read that section since i was a little kid
1028265 just recorded its biggest month ever in june with 115 million page views a 50 percent increase over last year
1028266 real estate advertisers during this downturn are going to be trying the web some of them for the first time and once they do they wont go back
1028267 it is not surprising that newspapers are starting to scale back their real estate sections the decision by the l a times is an example of things that were going to see more of as newspapers manage the contraction of their business which is what metro daily newspapers are going to be about for the foreseeable future
1028268 truly fundamental shifts are taking place in the advertising industry and a lot of advertising media are not coming back advertisers are going to be hard pressed to justify spending money on things they now know are inefficient
1028269 driven largely by a 23 percent fall in real estate classifieds
1028270 newspapers are beginning to understand that their most valuable franchise is not local news but local sales information
1028271 the epiphany that newspaper managers are beginning to experience is that local news and community information as opposed to national news may not attract a large or particularly attractive audience for small advertisers
1028272 most americans dont know a thing about what is happening in northern uganda
1028273 if these three random kids can just go to uganda with no experience and inspire us to be here just think what our whole country can do to help
1028274 change has to start somewhere and we must transition from idealism to the hard facts
1028275 its like one of those moments when you wake up in the morning and you just dont believe it
1028276 it is a completely shattering atrocity as if i was in a shell for 90 days like i was in jail i was separated from my children my wife and from my career
1028277 youd think that when someone who has responsibilities to a university and benefits our national security by teaching arabic language and culture it wouldnt take so long
1028278 i briefly spoke with dr akom i can say one word for his and my response relief
1028279 believes that the interests of justice can be best served not in the criminal courts but within the university community relying upon our extensive procedures for responding to incidents involving faculty
1028280 there ought to be ramifications within the university to make sure that things like this do not happen again
1028281 though charges have been dropped campus and community supporters remain outraged at the universitys lack of support for dr akom and the perceived indifference to racial profiling at san francisco state
1028282 specifically we are dismayed at president corrigans complete and uncritical acceptance of a deeply flawed investigation that failed to even consider professor akoms version of events to say nothing of the reports reliance on false evidence and incorrect information as fact
1028283 i already had my return ticket for the next day so i asked inquisitively could i still return to the u

1028285 his scholarship has nothing inflammatory he is a literary scholar i think very highly of him he doesnt have a political agenda
1028286 this is the kind of academic person the u s really needs to bridge the gap with the arabic and muslim world
1028287 i have no passion for people who support terrorist organizations
1028288 i respect all religions ethnicities and cultures there is nothing in my history to suggest militancy or extremism
1028289 i have no problem with security but i think this has gone past the reasonable limit
1028290 im very happy this is an amazing show of support this has always been about healing and not further harming theres a long way to go
1028291 gladly debate you president corrigan on the validity of your report if you think it can be defended name the time and place and ill be there
1028292 we call on the university to expose exactly how brown and renne participated in this ridiculous investigation
1028293 we should not allow the police to determine what the 21st century university looks like
1028294 how much longer must we have gatherings like this this is 2006 not 1896 san francisco not south africa this is a university not a plantation

1028318 too many of those criticizing obama have been content merely to slander him
1028319 an intellectual laziness among the very people who should be carefully scrutinizing obama
1028320 the way to beat obama is to unravel the reformer centrist brand the msm have marketed to the public there is still quite a bit of doubt about senator obama people are not so sure and this is why he is in a dead heat with mccain when frankly he should be 15 points ahead right now we republicans must change the direction of the brand freddoso does an incredible job void of sensationalism a just the facts maam job of peeling back the obama marketing campaign leaving the reader with the facts when you look at the full obama political record the way freddoso has in the book you understand how obama earned every bit of his most liberal u s senator title when the american people learn the facts through the new media in the coming months obama mania will spiral
1028321 drill already drill everywhere we need it and we need it now
1028322 and the speaker is just doing her best to avoid it and thats not going to work when this is an issue that cuts across so many political lines more than immigration more even than health care
1028323 shes the speaker of the house not the speaker of the democratic caucus
1028324 she could have avoided this whole thing by giving us a chance to talk about it last week but instead she shut us down early and got out of town and so were here and her members are back in the district getting an earful from their constituents
1028325 anything that drives this point home every single day is worth doing
1028326 a lot of the democrats agree with us but speaker pelosi is manipulating the rules and abusing the process to keep us from having a straight up or down vote
1028327 this is an issue that the democrats used to vilify us and weve now been vindicated were for exploration and production and while they attacked us for environmental irresponsibility many of them now understand we needed to be doing this years ago
1028328 i agree that immigrants should learn english i agree with that but understand this instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn english theyll learn english you need to make sure your child can speak spanish you should be thinking about how can your child become bilingual we should have every child speaking more than one language

1028336 strategy execution and corporate change programs as just 33 i m interested in whether other association professionals who read the 13 page brochure can offer suggestions for making change programs more effective
1028337 however even if people accept the changes they are often not operationally sound due to the fact that the people who have to implement the solution weren t really included in the design up front there are often simpler solutions to meet the same objectives that weren t considered people who speak out at that point are labeled as non believers and trouble makers
1028338 successful companies engage people much earlier in the front end of the planning process when people are engaged up front and are a part of generating the tactical plans there is no need to get buy in at any point the ideas are already theirs
1028339 that s the power of engagement up front when people are invited in to help solve tough business problems and have a big impact on the results they become inspired motivated and engaged this approach to leadership unlocks power in the organization
1028340 leadership impact is not about how aggressive decisive and visionary you are it is about how you bring that out in others
1028341 there is a tremendous amount of creativity ingenuity and determination that is untapped in companies
1028342 think about this is your goal to get the most out of people or the best out of people you typically can t get both
1028343 one of the worlds most prolific and fastest growing plants making it natures most sustainable resources
1028344 i start the album off with the obama speech not just because im african american but because i really feel like hes a fresh new voice and alternative from what weve seen in the political scene in some time
1028345 i see similarities in his way of thinking and my way i really like him a lot
1028346 well chuck is entitled to put considerations of personal friendship over everything else that we have talked about and hes said thats exactly what he has done martys opponent worked for chuck is the co author of his book with him and i understand a personal loyalty

1028350 so whats mommy dearests problem this time ulcer shingles tourettes
1028351 despite what you think you dont know everything about me
1028352 thats right you never say much of anything do you not to me anyway
1028353 i suppose i should be a good little puppet and tell you you complete me

1028357 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1028358 replaced at a later date so that we can get oil into the market
1028359 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1028360 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
1028361 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
1028362 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
1028363 its another example of short term political posturing from washington not the long term leadership we need to solve our dependence on oil
1028364 an excellent example of a group blog a true community of like minded but highly individual writers topics range from the state of christian publishing to craft issues to lyrical meditations on writing as a spiritual discipline
1028365 populist attempt to try to satisfy a lot of anxiety out there and it just doesnt work
1028366 senator obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we really need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we do need to tap the strategic petroleum reserves
1028367 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point
1028368 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1028369 theres little functional difference right now to our economy between the rapid run up of energy prices weve experienced as a result of international conditions and market speculation on the one hand versus a supply interruption on the other
1028370 the conventional wisdom is that 4 gasoline raises the odds that sen
1028371 in the pocket of big oil and the republicans are passing out tire gauges to mock obamas suggestions for making the nation more fuel efficent
1028372 an excellent example of a group blog a true community of like minded but highly individual writers topics range from the state of christian publishing to craft issues to lyrical meditations on writing as a spiritual discipline
1028373 coach ted impressed upon me how i could compensate for my shortcomings i had to be especially dedicated a thorough student of the sport if i wished to overcome my observable lack of ability
1028374 where the head goes the body must follow usually ted would add an underdog is in a position to take a healthy bite
1028375 the concept was also stated by hemingway as write the story take out all the good lines and see if it still works
1028376 my experience as a director and as a dramatist is this the piece is moving in proportion to how much the author can leave out
1028377 the point as aristotle told us is what happens to the
1028378 why would i box for a 1m when i can fight for 10 million cuban people
1028379 gold medals are wonderful but athletes cant eat their gold medals
1028380 the circumstances force you to make sacrifices and its a shame
1028381 in the old days olympic athletes were well taken care of and lived a more privileged life in cuba but things had gotten so bad that we werent much better off than anyone else
1028382 i will always be cuban and proud of my heritage but i had to follow my dream
1028383 we will not expose a cuban team again to the excesses and provocations that in this case would occur in chicago in us territory an ideal location for merchants and traffickers to act freely with the complicity of us authorities
1028384 i wouldnt say the cuban boxers are weak because even when they lose great fighters there are other ones coming up behind them but this team is not as experienced as theyve been before
1028385 and the defections might continue because kids are more aware of the world now with the internet promoters are going after those cuban kids and its hard to keep them from chasing their dream
1028386 the government took care of felix savon and he was very loyal but those were different times i have trouble keeping kids amateur in my gym so imagine how hard it is in cuba
1028387 we cant talk at this moment about grand goals or compare them with the athens team this team will enjoy their experience in the ring without thinking about medals
1028388 the situation today is very similar to that of barcelona 1992 when we arrived with no olympic experience due to our absence in los angeles 1984 and seoul 1988 and returned with seven gold medals
1028389 limo was founded on the notion that fragmentation of the mobile industry among dozens of proprietary closed operating systems was inhibiting innovation
1028390 with such a variety of industry players cost effectively adopting the limo platform for non differentiating handset middleware more development resources are being devoted to enhancing the consumer experience this new wave of limo handsets serves as proof
1028391 dying for somebody doesnt mean much its all about who you live for
1028392 the expert advice that we are getting is that the situation continues to improve and the measures which have included shutting factories and limiting traffic they put in place are still having a positive effect we have had three or four days of outstanding blue sky weather and we do not think it is going to be an issue no athletes here have been using face masks
1028393 theres a really positive atmosphere in the team people are really excited
1028394 they have trained for their whole lives for this moment and they are like coiled springs waiting to explode the village is fantastic absolutely unbelievable athletes have never had such good conditions as they have here in beijing
1028395 the smog did not seem to affect us when we trained this morning we have no issues with that its mainly the heat and humidity
1028396 we have been training in macau for a couple of weeks where it was hotter and more humid so hopefully by the time it comes to the matches we will be used to it
1028397 it has been 43 degrees c pitchside which has been pretty tough but it gets easier every day you can never cool down due to the humidity so we are using every technique we can to cool players when they come off the pitch even ice blankets
1028398 the mother had locked in the children and went out when the shack caught fire

1028456 this is my father yes it is him but his left shoulder should be a little lower because that is how he looked he always wore a pair of trousers with a turn up but i can see you have given him a straight type that he did not like at all
1028457 you should lower it a little bit because that is how he walked and i also walk with my hand half open and raised a little bit
1028458 i knew him very well it was rare to see him without them it will be easier for those who knew him to identify him if he has them on
1028459 but otherwise this is him the features in the face are real only if you can work on the hand put on that hat and make a turn up then you will get it right
1028460 i have been working on it for the past two weeks and it has been very helpful that people come here with various comments the committee has been able to see if i am moving in the right direction and it helps in the sense that changes can be made before we put harder materials which are difficult to remove and remould
1028461 i have not charged the committee too much money maybe just enough to cover the costs because i really appreciate that they have given me a chance to work on a project of this magnitude i am not much into making money but to prove myself to everybody that i am capable
1028462 this is also an opportunity for higher learning institutions to showcase various study opportunities in iks

1028467 no one disputes that a president can withdraw or revise an executive order at any time
1028468 but abrogating a published executive order without any public notice works a secret change in the law
1028469 because the published order stays on the books it actively misleads congress and the public as to what the law is
1028470 on rare occasions national security can justify elected officials keeping some information secret
1028471 but it can never justify lying to the american people about what the law is maintaining two different sets of laws one public and one secret is just that deceiving the american people about what law applies to the governments conduct
1028472 i would love more kids but number three is taking much longer than i thought
1028473 there are no two ways about it we have to make sure that anheuser busch employees in upstate new york and beyond keep their jobs and full benefits the baldwinsville facility lies at the heart of the local economy and it should stay that way
1028474 i urge inbev to keep its pledge to continue operations at all 12 breweries across the country and to promise to keep affordable health benefits for its employees the anheuser busch employees are dedicated workers who deserve affordable health care and the benefits they have earned
1028475 anheuser busch has a strong relationship with its employees built upon the principles of fairness hard work and honesty as inbev prepares to take over operations of anheuser busch facilities across the united states we urge you to carry on this tradition of cooperation and transparency
1028476 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive this is usually from the lowest order or the edge of the pool
1028477 this really suggests the need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risk of diving related injuries
1028478 theres a lot that can be done to make diving a safer recreational activity or sport
1028479 having a lifeguard or other supervision present is really important
1028480 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
1028481 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury
1028482 there are too many unknowns in this study to make conclusions about the relationship between cough and cold medicine and altes
1028483 they raised a lot of possibilities but the question is what do you do in follow up
1028484 how it ended up touching the wires whether a piece of equipment failed and it slipped and touched the wires or whether the act of jacking it up higher on one side caused it to touch we just dont know yet
1028485 has also led a one man crusade to keep the american people ignorant about what is at stake in the debate over off shore drilling
1028486 repealed as of the date of enactment of this act
1028487 this pleasant sounding bill has provisions buried within its language that would impose many billions of dollars of foreign aid obligations on america up to 845 billion in the next 13 years over and above what we already give in foreign aid
1028488 i brought pictures in and presented them to the committee of very premature babies from my neonatal resuscitation book from the american pediatric association trying to show them unwanted babies were being cast aside babies the same age were being treated if they were wanted
1028489 doctors really dont care about children who are being born with a reasonable prospect of life because they are so locked into their pro abortion views that they would watch an infant that is viable die
1028490 that may be your assessment and i dont see any evidence of that what we are doing here is to create one more burden on a woman and i cant support that

1028495 most name matching solutions identify variations due to phonetic errors accounting for only 20 to 25 percent of all name matching errors
1028496 in addition to phonetic errors the interthinx solution will overcome common variations associated with misspellings transpositions acronyms nicknames and many other errors providing our customers better precision when approving or denying business partners
1028497 suitability has become a big focus for 2008 but as many lenders are finding its hard to implement and enforce
1028498 in this case regulators want to ensure that the mortgage loan provided to the borrower offers a net tangible benefit to the borrower that the loan originator hasnt been steering or directing a borrower into a loan program thats not as beneficial to the borrower as it could be and that the borrower has a reasonable ability to repay the loan
1028499 most lenders follow a loan origination process that pushes the decisioning process or decisioning iterations towards the end of the mortgage cycle
1028500 this approach puts the emphasis on the three suitability criteria days and weeks after the borrower initiates the process which is not good because these delays can interfere with those criteria being achieved
1028501 the environmental summit is a perfect way for us to get input and ideas from the community and elected officials
1028502 by gathering ideas from the community we can continue to improve the services our dedicated staff members provide to the residents of galveston county

1028504 the plan approved by the galveston county united board of health is designed to make measurable improvements in the health of galveston county
1028505 offers an opportunity to make mccain the candidate of change while branding sen obama as the captive of the status quo by catering to environmentalists over the national interest
1028506 as less of a shift and more as a gesture of sorts to the reality that the major cap and trade legislation next year that congress will mark up requires the participation of and compromise from the industry
1028507 ought to have more land water to figure out where oil is and then tap those pools
1028508 not quite a complete and utter reversal but certainly a shift in tone and language indicating a softening of his opposition and a recognition that energy legislation requires compromise
1028509 has taken flexibility too far by selling out on offshore drilling
1028510 by even sorta backing new drilling he is sending exactly the opposite message to the public maintaining the fiction that there is no urgency to changing our ways
1028511 now doing a modified limited switcheroo to block any john mccain traction on the issue
1028512 hell start to publicly lobby democratic leaders on capitol hill to allow a vote on drilling when they return from their august recess
1028513 if he can control the message debate for a few days it will be seen as a good week for obama
1028514 does signal a new willingness by the obama camp to return the fire theyve been taking for the better part of a week
1028515 mccain appears to be getting some mileage on the issue of gas prices
1028516 obama is proving adept at doing just enough to diffuse the situation without capitulating in any meaningful way
1028517 revolves around the notion that mccain will differ little from president bush
1028518 both parties have used gas and energy prices during the summer only to see it fade as a priority in the fall see for example 2006

1028535 sports fans around the world have been swindled by an international internet scam which offered thousands of bogus tickets for the beijing games olympic officials said on monday the international olympic committee ioc announced it was taking action to shut down the fraudsters but the move came too late to help the victims find replacement seats at the games
1028536 to agree upon regulations and commercial conditions which will provide a framework for a strong and dynamic sport
1028537 run them on sunday and sell them on monday but weve seen comments like the cot is like nothing in the showrooms we can agree with that but it appears that the prevailing wisdom is having a presence in motorsports is better than not having one
1028538 the bridge comes from the result of a combination of functional demands
1028539 there are highway tunnels down below so we couldnt put in pillars also the shape of the curve was dictated by the tramway so we have had to adapt our techniques in order to do this very large span
1028540 it took us three models of the bridge in order to achieve the particular inclination of the pylon trying to minimize the use of materials and to make it as efficient as possible so the shape that seems to be capricious is not it is really the result of a very deep introspection into the behavior of the bridge the goal was to do this pylon as clean and transparent as possible my goal was not to do something that will come to signify the city the opposite i wanted to almost make it disappear

1028547 its not everything but its more than we get on most projects

1028644 the newly proposed accounting standard would require corporations to disclose more to investors regarding their potential losses due to product toxicity environmental remediation and other liabilities this is an important step forward in improving corporate disclosure
1028645 most notably under the proposed standard companies are allowed to avoid disclosing severe threats in their financial statements if they believe that a loss is only remotely likely and that the issue would not be resolved during the coming year
1028646 investors have seen a long history of companies underestimating the likelihood of severe financial threats enron subprime lending and asbestos liabilities are all examples of this trend these large issues developed for many years with eventual catastrophic consequences for investors fasb should recognize the importance of long term risk disclosure and require companies to disclose all severe impact threats even if the management believes they are only remotely probable
1028647 the proposal may allow corporate lawyers to routinely block disclosure of almost any information that they designate as potentially damaging to the company or prejudicial this discretionary withholding of information will surely impact investors
1028648 when investors are unaware of impending financial pain at companies in which they hold stock they often face expensive surprises securities laws and related financial accounting principles are supposed to arm investors with information to avoid these shocks but these safeguards are proving inadequate to the task
1028649 the fasb proposal fails to require reporting companies to disclose all loss contingencies that could pose a severe threat to the company a key pitfall for investors is the tendency of companies to underestimate the likelihood of severe financial threats and thereby conceal the risks
1028650 investor input is critical on these issues as business organizations can be expected to turn out in force to oppose expanded disclosure concerned investors need to speak out and be heard
1028651 an unusual opportunity to bring off balance sheet environmental and social liabilities to light improved disclosure of these liabilities will significantly improve our ability to analyze companies and thus to act as long term investors

1028660 yes after we started investigating the issues it was primarily a contract partnership dispute under california law however i do believe that this case is yet more evidence that users of online worlds have a tendency to believe that their actions in the virtual world are somehow immune to real world laws
1028661 either that or they just forget about reality when they enter into activities online
1028662 most people dont stop to think about their actions because technology has made it so very easy to perform dishonest illegal or other negatively impacting actions that is before many technological advances over the past 10 15 years people had to actually plan consider and contemplate their actions and then make a mental decision to perform some action which they knew or should have known was illegal or otherwise wrong however because that same action can now be performed in a 1 2 second without a second thought users dont give the same consideration to their actions im not saying that all users behave in this manner but i do see a trend of this behavior i also see a false sense of entitlement in that users believe that because illegal activity is so easy it therefore must be ok technology is partly to blame for not building in proper safeguards but at the end of the day users and individuals must take responsibility for their actions
1028663 the technological ease of infringement has resulted in some dumbing down of the consuming public and has created or instilled in them a false sense of entitlement to creative works of authorship
1028664 the market will always correct itself because many content creators will eventually stop creating content if they cant get paid for their work and only the die hards and true artists will remain education is really the only way to curtail or modify peoples online behavior and education is a hard lesson learned when the classroom is a court of law
1028665 virtual world residents attorneys and other interested parties should watch closely for judicial rulings that address the issue as to whether digital communications between computer generated images will be interpreted to constitute oral communications in the first instance
1028666 this is particularly relevant when as in this case the real parties associated with their sl avatars had never met or even spoken on the telephone the impediments to verify the real identity of an avatar one talks to in world suggests the ultimate answer may be in the negative such a ruling will have a dramatic impact on all forms of virtual contracting

1028753 every season we design a limited number of luxury pieces many just for show like our mink topper which we produced last fall but the reaction from our sellers and clients to these high end pieces was incredible even the show items sold out immediately
1028754 with this kind of feedback i was thrilled to have the opportunity to design a set of unique pieces with rare fabrics and furs intricate features and luxurious details that make the luxe pieces so special

1028763 this first of its kind global survey shows that there are people living with hiv and aids in the u s today who despite having access to treatments are choosing not to start or to discontinue arv therapy due to concerns about side effects
1028764 that so many patients are deferring treatment in an age when we have so many options is regrettable as for those patients who repeatedly discontinue their therapy without clinicians guidance there is a real danger of developing resistance to arv drugs furthermore treatment interruption without medical monitoring may result in accelerated disease progression it is imperative that physicians and patients address concerns about side effects openly and evaluate potential new and different treatment options that may be more tolerable
1028765 despite years of education and awareness raising around hiv and aids there are today people living with hiv and aids in america who are concerned about others knowing their hiv status because of societal discrimination and stigma
1028766 the survey makes it clear that although the hiv community has made significant strides there is still a great deal of work needed to eradicate the stigma and discrimination that continues to be associated with hiv disease

1028797 it all depends on the implementation how it fits into the content the layout and a given sites brand and market positioning

1028822 a plentiful subsistence increases the bodily strength of the labourer and the comfortable hope of bettering his condition and of ending his days perhaps in ease and plenty animates him to exert that strength to the utmost where wages are high accordingly we shall always find the workman more active diligent and expeditious than where they are low in england for example than in scotland in the neighbourhood of great towns than in remote country places 3

1028835 remote technology enables us to redesign our business practices to better manage buildings and equipment and to provide services at a reduced cost
1028836 many of the equipment diagnostic services needed to improve performance dont require a person to physically touch the equipment

1028838 remote monitoring and engineering services pave the way for better customer support through more efficient and sustainable solutions

1028850 the dawn of light is fast overtaking the regime of darkness and impunity
1028851 given the depth and capacity of entrenched anti democratic elements in the party who prefer the easy route of imposition to the civilized culture of election it takes the courage of a forward looking politician and the conviction and commitment of a technocrat
1028852 the dawn of light is fast overtaking the regime of darkness and impunity
1028853 i therefore call on all genuine democrats within the party to rise up in defence of this new initiative to open up the space for equal participation in our party consistent with party rules and guidelines because those that profit from the flawed past will not just sit and watch
1028854 the supremacy of the rule of law will surely assume greater and nobler stature when the party in government the pdp domesticates that time honoured principle in the way members are treated and new ones recruited especially during party congresses
1028855 now everybody who wants to lead has a right and equal opportunity to come and canvas his credentials while those who are content to be lead will have the right to choose who their leaders should be
1028856 that is the eternal beauty of democracy if you offer yourself and win you can then happily exclaim that you are carrying the peoples mandate but if you lose you will be happy that it was a fair contest that way the virus of manipulation with its attendant pain and hurt will be checkmated even if not completely eliminated

1028868 if you understand your art you must be able to discover the kings ruby do so and i will give you two hundred pieces of gold but if you do not succeed within six hours i will use all my influence at court to have you put to death as an impostor
1028869 o woman woman thou art more baneful to the happiness of man than the poisonous dragon of the desert
1028870 you are discovered my dear mistress you are discovered by a vile astrologer before six hours are past the whole story will be known and you will become infamous if you are even so fortunate as to escape with life unless you can find some way of prevailing on him to be merciful
1028871 spare my honour and my life and i will confess everything
1028872 oh nothing nothing with which you are not already acquainted you know too well that i stole the ruby from the kings crown i did so to punish my husband who uses me most cruelly and i thought by this means to obtain riches for myself and to have him put to death but you most wonderful man from whom nothing is hidden have discovered and defeated my wicked plan i beg only for mercy and will do whatever you command me
1028873 woman i know all thou hast done and it is fortunate for thee that thou hast come to confess thy sin and beg for mercy before it was too late return to thy house put the ruby under the pillow of the couch on which thy husband sleeps let it be laid on the side furthest from the door and be satisfied thy guilt shall never be even suspected
1028874 courage my dearest husband this is only your first labour in your new and noble profession go on and prosper and we shall become rich and happy
1028875 i am an astrologer i know the sun and the moon and the stars and the twelve signs of the zodiac i can calculate nativities i can foretell everything that is to happen
1028876 a man of your knowledge and penetration will easily discover my jewels find them and i will give you fifty pieces of gold
1028877 stay here a few moments thou great astrologer i will return immediately with the reward thou so well deservest
1028878 thou wonderful man to whom all the secrets of nature are revealed i had quite forgotten where i laid the jewels and without thee should never have found them but when thou desiredst me to look at the rent below i instantly recollected the rent near the bottom of the wall in the bathroom where before undressing i had hid them i can now go home in peace and comfort and it is all owing to thee thou wisest of men
1028879 i am going to my death the kings astrologer has heard of my presumption and is determined to have me executed as an impostor
1028880 the ways of heaven most learned and excellent ahmed are unsearchable the high are often cast down and the low are lifted up the whole world depends upon fate and fortune it is my turn now to be depressed by fate it is thine to be exalted by fortune
1028881 but who were they and what have they done with my gold and jewels
1028882 i cannot now answer but i hope to satisfy your majesty if you will grant me forty days to make my calculations
1028883 but when they are past if my treasure is not found your life shall pay the forfeit
1028884 except that i am to be put to death at the end of forty days unless i find forty chests of gold and jewels which have been stolen from the royal treasury
1028885 by the same art which discovered the ruby and the ladys necklace
1028886 foolish woman thou knowest that i have no art and that i have only pretended to it for the sake of pleasing thee but i have had sufficient skill to gain forty days during which time we may easily escape to some other city and with the money i now possess and the aid of my former occupation we may still obtain an honest livelihood
1028887 will thy cobbling thou mean spiritless wretch ever enable me to go to the hemm m like the wife of the chief astrologer i hear me ahmed think only of discovering the kings treasure thou hast just as good a chance of doing so as thou hadst of finding the ruby and the necklace and earrings at all events i am determined thou shalt not escape and shouldst thou attempt to run away i will inform the kings officers and have thee taken up and put to death even before the forty days are expired thou knowest me too well ahmed to doubt my keeping my word so take courage and endeavour to make thy fortune and to place me in that rank of life to which my beauty entitles me
1028888 your will shall be obeyed all i desire is to pass the few remaining days of my life as comfortably as i can you know i am no scholar and have little skill in reckoning so there are forty dates give me one of them every night after i have said my prayers that i may put them in a jar and by counting them may always see how many of the few days i have to live are gone
1028889 we are all found out ahmed the new astrologer has told the king that there are forty of us
1028890 this ahmed with all his simple good nature is a shrewd fellow forty chests having been stolen he naturally guessed that there must be forty thieves and he has made a good hit that is all still it is prudent to watch him for he certainly has made some strange discoveries one of us must go to night after dark to the terrace of this cobblers house and listen to his conversation with his handsome wife for he is said to be very fond of her and will no doubt tell her what success he has had in his endeavours to detect us
1028891 my dear wife to night there are two of them
1028892 the number is complete to night the whole forty are here
1028893 have patience i know what you are come for it is a very unjust and wicked deed
1028894 we are fully convinced that thou knowest why we are come nor do we mean to justify the action of which thou speakest here are two thousand pieces of gold which we will give thee provided thou wilt swear to say nothing more about the matter
1028895 do you think it possible i can suffer such gross wrong and injustice without complaining and making it known to all the world
1028896 only spare our lives and we will restore the royal treasure
1028897 guilty men ye are persuaded that ye cannot escape from my penetration which reaches unto the sun and moon and knows the position and aspect of every star in the heavens your timely repentance has saved you but ye must immediately restore all that ye have stolen go straightway and carry the forty chests exactly as ye found them and bury them a foot deep under the southern wall of the old ruined hemm m beyond the kings palace if ye do this punctually your lives are spared but if ye fail in the slightest degree destruction will fall upon you and your families
1028898 ahmed thy looks are promising hast thou discovered my treasure
1028899 does your majesty require the thieves or the treasure the stars will only grant one or the other
1028900 your majesty must make your choice i can deliver up either but not both
1028901 but if it must be so i choose the treasure
1028902 and you give the thieves a full and free pardon
1028903 if your majesty will follow me the treasure shall be restored to you

1028930 if it isnt unsafe where the water is collected the water is unsafe by the time it gets home
1028931 the truth is that the sanitation mdg target has been missed we need now to be looking beyond 2015 renewed commitment to go beyond the progress toward the mdgs and actually achieve the vision of the mdgs and go beyond it toward universal progress

1029030 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
1029031 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
1029032 northern ireland is crying out for bright young politicians with new ideas and fresh thinking yet how would they ever get a foot on the political ladder when every run of that ladder is occupied by greedy politicians with dual and even triple mandates
1029033 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1029034 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1029035 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1029036 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1029037 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers

1029040 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
1029041 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
1029042 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
1029043 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means

1029114 those people who make a living out of short selling stocks are bordering on criminality
1029115 those stock market players who have no interest in the company who spread or propagate rumours that they havent been bothered to check and then sell into the back of those rumours i dont think theyre doing anyone any good
1029116 and of course when we hear that weve got cracks in the bottom of our ore cars or even a ship has sunk at the berth
1029117 we know those things are being put out to scare the mums and dads into selling their shares and of course the people whove shorted their shares then go and buy those shares off

1029122 we have been doing this now since 1988 and this is actually the worst it has ever been
1029123 we are driving to people who need this food to live every time i look at my gas bill there is an increase of 100 to 200 a month i am going to run out of gas
1029124 the gas crisis and increase in food prices have made it much more important to look at improving the system and making it run more efficiently
1029125 what we have seen is that it is difficult to find people due to the gas who will travel far
1029126 we can see people reluctant to spend more time because it is costing them money to do so
1029127 unfortunately we have not been able to sustain as many full time employees as we used to
1029128 we didnt let anybody go but we are not replacing certain positions when somebody leaves
1029129 this is probably the most challenging time we have had
1029130 the pressure of the forces are coming from all around us
1029131 the spanish government has got really tough and officials have been conducting snap inspections to ensure that agents are adhering to regulations a good example is decree 218 which requires agents to provide buyers with information similar to that available in the uks home information packs hips agents who do not comply are being prosecuted and obviously the tighter controls are helping in terms of transparency this we can see from spains new position in the jones lang lasalle index
1029132 ma ho lo stesso debito adesso di quando ho finito la scuola perch ogni mese riesco a fare soltanto il pagamento minimo che copre a malapena gli interessi sul capitale che mi hanno prestato e siccome la rata anche salita insieme ai tassi dinteresse non ho fatto nessun passo avanti
1029133 per sopravvivere ho dovuto trovarmi un secondo lavoro faccio il tutor per alcuni studenti la sera e durante il fine settimana e accetto ogni lavoretto che mi passa per le mani solo cos posso permettermi di vivere da sola prima di fare la scuola di legge avevo lavorato per due anni nel settore non profit ma mi ero subito resa conto che senza un master non avrei mai potuto accedere ai livelli di lavoro che pi mi piacevano e cos la specializzazione in legge mi sembr la scelta migliore ma la mia famiglia non era in grado di pagare la retta n io avevo soldi per farlo cos ho chiesto due prestiti uno pubblico e uno privato
1029134 avevo scelto di andare proprio a villanova perch l davano una borsa di studio chiamata public service che copriva ben il cinquanta per cento della retta se tu ti impegnavi a lavorare nel settore pubblico nei primi cinque anni dopo la fine degli studi questo mi impedisce oggi di fare lavori pi remunerativi ma ho anche la met dei debiti dei miei compagni di corso
1029135 negli ultimi dieci anni due milioni di studenti meritevoli non hanno potuto frequentare luniversit perch non avevano i soldi necessari
1029136 e inaccettabile ripete obama unamerica in cui non puoi mettere a frutto il tuo talento perch non sei ricco di famiglia perfino la retta dei college cresciuta del 40 per cento negli ultimi cinque anni e cos lingresso al college che per generazioni di americani stato il passaporto per un futuro migliore oggi un sogno che per molti sta svanendo
1029137 io sono la meno indebitata della mia classe la maggior parte dei miei compagni di scuola che non hanno avuto la borsa di studio e oggi lavorano come avvocati negli studi privati devono restituire una cifra che va da 120 a 150mila dollari io nel settore pubblico guadagno 45mila dollari lordi lanno loro almeno 20mila dollari in pi per chi ha trovato posto in un piccolo studio legale prende intorno ai 65mila dollari ma avendo il doppio dei debiti se la passa ben peggio visto che deve pagare pi di mille dollari al mese chi invece entrato nellempireo negli studi con pi di 500 avvocati guadagna oltre 100mila dollari allanno del gruppo di amici con cui ho studiato eravamo in cinque ben tre hanno scelto di fare lavori che non amano e che anzi detestano per poter estinguere il debito
1029138 sto attentissima a come spendo i soldi segno su un quaderno ogni spesa che faccio dal caff al biglietto dellautobus perch devo tenere ogni cosa sotto controllo se voglio arrivare alla fine del mese
1029139 non penso esistesse un altro modo volevo davvero andare a quella scuola e leducazione che ho ricevuto mi permette di poter fare il lavoro che desideravo senza la scuola di legge questa carriera non sarebbe stata possibile ma non mi basteranno trentanni per ripagare il debito ho unamica di famiglia che si laureata a villanova 15 anni prima di me e aveva un prestito simile ora ha avuto dei figli e lavora part time e non riesce sempre a pagare le rate
1029140 io penso che sia osceno che un ragazzo debba indebitarsi per tutta la vita per poter studiare
1029141 alcuni amici avvocati ci dissero addirittura che saremmo finiti nelle maglie della fed perch stavamo violando le leggi federali
1029142 e cos piuttosto che sfidare le ire di bernanke preferimmo limitarci ad apire linee di credito solo per i cittadini dei paesi emergenti
1029143 siamo una non profit che dipende molto dal volontariato e dalla carit degli utenti
1029144 pu sembrare incredibile ma oltre il 70 per cento dei prestatori seppure non siano obbligati a farlo sceglie di donare anche di pi
1029145 primo tra tutti quello della scelta dei partner che dovevano garantire il microcredito nei paesi nei quali andavamo a realizzare i prestiti

1029333 we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1029334 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1029335 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
1029336 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1029337 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1029338 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest

1029373 het omzetaandeel van nederlandse bedrijven in de omzet van atos origin is groot een nederlandse ceo is belangrijk voor de taal en de contacten met klanten
1029374 het is de cultuur dat topbestuurders tegenwoordig bijna direct aan de kant worden gezet als het slecht gaat met een bedrijf
1029375 zij versnellen net als wij de groei van hun bedrijven en ze zorgen voor een basisomzet
1029376 dat is voldoende om op eigen benen te kunnen staan en met ongeveer zes tot zeven werknemers al in jaar een break even te zijn

1029379 op dit moment kost het enkele dagen en honderden gigabytes om een domein over te nemen als het alleen om computable nl gaat is dat een hoop werk maar als het om het hele nl of het com domein gaat is dat voor een crimineel zeker de moeite waard hoewel het op zou moeten vallen wanneer een crimineel probeert de juiste afzenderpoort te raden zijn er genoeg providers aan het slaapwandelen het is dus mogelijk dat een crimineel een gepatchte dns server bij een provider overneemt zonder dat die provider daar iets van merkt

1029381 this acquisition aligns well with our strategy to deliver improved bottom line results and further strengthen one of our companys platform businesses
1029382 with a full management team already in place we are prepared to deliver merger benefits quickly while continuing to closely manage our capacity with our customers demand

1029384 the completion of this acquisition allows us to begin to successfully integrate two very strong industrial packaging businesses with this good strategic business fit we can provide better solutions to meet our customers needs while becoming more profitable and more competitive as a company

1029386 if you have the pc as your lead machine you have the problem of not knowing what configurations people have how many gigs of ram or what graphics card they have
1029387 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows
1029388 we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage taking the pc or ps3 to these things just isnt convenient
1029389 wed love to have more exclusive hits on our box absolutely are we investing in that yes we are does that take a lot of time yes it does
1029390 we havent changed the direction of the development were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
1029391 im telling them to not think about the xbox 360 right now
1029392 we can think about it after the development kits arrive
1029393 we arent going to change any specifications of ffxiii because of the multi platform announcement
1029394 what you can say really quite clearly and not get into too much argument about it is that the 360 is much easier to develop for its easier to get the performance out of it that it can deliver and the rasterizer the gpu side is generally faster than what the ps3 has
1029395 you could design a game where the ps3 would be the superior platform but youd have to go out of your way to do it if youre doing a game like people just want to do games now the 360s the better platform

1029403 there are many questions that the fbi and the pakistani government need to answer in light of this admission
1029404 aafia siddiqui is a woman who has been plagued by a number of problems in her life none of which have anything to do with involvement with al qaeda
1029405 whilst we welcome this disclosure from the fbi it has only come after mounting international pressure and five years of detention and abuse siddiquis case represents the problem of disappearances in pakistan in the most tragic way the acceptance by the fbi that siddiqui has been in custody in afghanistan raises important questions which must be answered by the pakistani and us governments siddiqui must be returned to pakistan in order to faces charges for any crime she may have committed or released along with her children british human rights organisation cageprisoners has led the campaign for aafia siddiqui for the past three years since her disappearance in march 2003 in karachi along with her three young children the fbi has continually denied reports of her detention and that she was in their custody in july 2008 cageprisoners patron yvonne ridley and director saghir hussain highlighted the case with the launch of their report devoid of the rule of the law at a press conference organised by imran khan in pakistan the press conference sparked an international storm of outrage with calls for the identification of prisoner 650 and the release of aafia siddiqui

1029498 this study is significant because previous findings have been contradictory and the present investigation includes the largest number of heart attacks in an elderly group to date
1029499 our findings make a persuasive case that adiponectin is in fact associated with an increase in heart disease risk in older persons
1029500 this study shows that this abundant product of fat cells is a marker and perhaps even a mediator of worsened outcomes in persons aged 65 years and older

1029512 however in 1931 this mathematician surprised and excited for the world of mathematics when he discovered the proof
1029513 if it fulfills its promise it will probably be a whole new business
1029514 you should not expect us to say well go buy products on a far away island devices seem like that to us
1029515 i look at other businesses that were not involved in like med tech and ask do we know how to buy such businesses

1029517 with the support of more than 290 members of congress including more than 75 republicans h r 6604 was well on its way to being passed over the two thirds vote requirement sending a clear signal that transparency and enforcement would return to the commodities and futures markets then republican leadership demanded that members change their votes in order to protect president bush
1029518 h r 6604 is a bipartisan bill that passed the agriculture committee by voice vote
1029519 it is the product of a comprehensive series of hearings to examine the issues surrounding futures trading from all sides and it clearly has enough support to pass this house
1029520 we will continue to pursue meaningful steps to address the conditions that have thrown some futures markets into disorder and hope that members will have the courage of their convictions to join us
1029521 its pretty clear that the markets are not functioning as they should
1029522 without adequate oversight and transparency we will only continue down this slippery slope leaving americas family farmers and ranchers in jeopardy
1029523 there are many reasons for high energy prices this bill does not and cannot address all of them however it is a good step to addressing our concerns in the markets
1029524 i urge the senate to act quickly on similar legislation and the house to continue and work toward passing this necessary legislation
1029525 would have required transparency and improved access prevented excessive speculation by requiring the cftc establish requirements limiting speculation and strengthened the cftc with legal authority and increased staffing to address oversight surveillance and regulation
1029526 a few key members of congress pushed hard and were successful in including permanent disaster assistance programs in the 2008 farm bill
1029527 some of the stories in the news include vans and trucks with built in pump and tank units that drive over the filling port at service stations access the ports through a hole in the floor and pump the fuel into the tank they replace the port so no one knows what they were doing and then drive off this often happens in broad daylight
1029528 another trick is to use containers that will slide underneath a car and punch a hole through the fuel tank the fuel is quickly drained into the containers still others use a siphon hose to empty unattended fuel tanks
1029529 owners of large operations may want to purchase extra fuel now as a hedge against rising prices but remember that what goes up may come down
1029530 we try to park our road equipment at a designated area where they can be watched or we park them by the entrance to someones property where they will drive by them and can watch them for us
1029531 when weve had a severe shock to the market especially the corn market weve had stocks in place to moderate price and provide supply to domestic and export customers
1029532 we can lose sight of that and now were on unfamiliar territory because we havent had the same situation in the past
1029533 and in the cases of 1983 and 1988 we had substantial reserves that made a tremendous difference
1029534 yields went from 120 bushels per acre down to 85 bushels think about that percentage drop
1029535 today were facing something equally severe however we dont have the stocks that we had then
1029536 when you think about spending 25 cents to 30 cents per bushel per year for storing a portion of the crop rather than spending 1 or 2 per bushel in some cases for government payments were not being very truthful about how much it costs relative to the damage it can do when it isnt in place
1029537 millions of dollars per crop per year for the storage it would be in the high millions towards 1 billion but wed be getting a more stable price structure for farmers here and around the world it would allow those buying our commodities to pay a larger share of the cost of production and have that stock available at times like these
1029538 it isnt just livestock it is affecting so many sectors of the economy both domestic and international is coming home maybe this is a teachable moment and people will understand we should be preparing for the next go around
1029539 in my view the cost of a farmer owned grain reserve is peanuts compared to whats been spent and the damage its done in the past without the storage
1029540 thats mostly determined by where the release price is set if the release price is set too low sure itll have a downward pressure very quickly
1029541 but when you set it high enough you want downward pressure on prices just ask the livestock producers who are in extreme trouble right now
1029542 sounded kind of logical and appealing these last few years have shown they arent that relevant wed have been much better off if we could have raised the price in 1988 1999 2000 and 2001 by sopping up some of that excess for times like this
1029543 in many places im into a third replant with both corn and soybeans its been a very challenging year
1029544 how do you explain why wheat prices are high why rice prices are high you certainly cant grow corn on rice land and wheat lands are largely unsuitable for corn is ethanol responsible for high steel prices too or could there be other factors influencing commodity prices
1029545 it just doesnt track true that ethanol or even farmers take of the total supermarket dollar is responsible for the recent upsurge in food prices you must look deeper
1029546 the prudent thing would have been to implement a farmer owned reserve if wed done it then wed have stabilized prices above cost of production saved taxpayers subsidy payments and in turn those reserves would now be moderating the price of corn and providing the benefits of food and energy security
1029547 if we do that well quickly return to the same old paradigm of farmers producing below cost of production and taxpayers making up the difference the cost of production will be paid from the marketplace or from the government through subsidies and tax dollars
1029548 i cant turn it off and on with a switch its subject to the whims of mother nature i could produce a bountiful crop or as it appears this year a meager one we must have a farmer owned reserve to stabilize the ups and downs of production and stabilize the marketplace for everyone not just farmers
1029549 yet we dont have a strategic grain reserve i dont understand that are we more concerned about driving cars than eating
1029550 cereal and bakery products are projected to double in price this year the important part here is consumers see cereal prices go up when input prices rise but they never see the pass through when input prices fall
1029551 when the crop prices collapsed in 1996 the grocery store prices didnt come down at all in many cases they went up for things like pork chops ground beef and milk
1029552 thats a giant jump the world bank and the united nations food and agriculture organization project that an additional 100 million people could face malnourishment because of the current price environment
1029553 holding onto any reserves at all so the world ending stocks for corn wheat and rice have all fallen by more than 40 percent since the 1999 2000 season
1029554 the world bank has pressured countries to eliminate their own reserve programs much like the u s eliminated theirs and the eu and china reduced their buffer stock programs
1029555 countries like kenya and malawi were forced by the world bank to sell off their reserves that was partly because of fiscal austerity reasons but it was also partly to repay debt to the world bank
1029556 those included a lot of regional storage programs that were used to take in crops and bring them to market but also as a reserve against times of crisis for high food prices and a hedge against low supply
1029557 were now in a situation where theres no buffer to protect people from a severe food crisis
1029558 more of the same bad medicine the next round of wto talks at doha will present a new opportunity but its really just more of the same and more of the same in the current environment wont help farmers and consumers in the developing world or here at home
1029559 its absolutely critical that people understand the need to let a market oriented farm policy determine farm prices
1029560 now its a global question because were all tied together through trade agreements
1029561 no one knows how high prices will go of course on a global scale the people with the most money will buy food and those with the least will starve weve gone from freedom to farm in 1996 to freedom to starve in 2008
1029562 followed a disastrous market oriented farm policy that has destroyed family farm agriculture in this country
1029563 i see the g 8 leaders have said there may be a need for reserves after all well its a little too late to figure that out after weve lost so many farmers around the world and people are starving
1029564 part of those shocks will be from supply side weather and pests other parts might be demand side caused by government policy whether an ethanol policy the russians deciding to feed their livestock instead of slaughter them or a war
1029565 things will happen it isnt a case of just getting past this current crisis and everything will be okay we need to use this as a teachable moment and get ready for the next time
1029566 first we must prepare for the short run sort of disturbances we dont know when theyll occur but we know they will that means we need a reserve program
1029567 we need preparations for long term trends in agriculture whatever those are if it turns out the supply increases faster than demand and we know the nature of agriculture is it doesnt adjust to low prices quickly either on the supply or demand side we need to provide some price and quantity stabilization
1029568 that means an element of supply control as we move into a more globalized environment reserves need not only be at the country level but internationally coordinated obviously that adds another level of complexity
1029569 i dont know how long it will take people to get to the point where they understand how agriculture commodities differ from bolts cds and other stuff
1029570 at the end of the season well find out if the dodgers want me to finish my career here were going to sit down and talk about the situation
1029571 i never contacted the red sox after the deal was made

1029573 i grew up in the cps system and as a father its really disgusting to send a child to a school that doesnt even have toilet paper or has 20 year old books its despicable
1029574 there would be an increase of manhours in construction no doubt
1029575 im not buying that all of a sudden were going to have full employment
1029576 this is a great honor to even be asked to be a part of this series
1029577 i am looking forward to the trip and the opportunity as well as representing the university of maryland in that capacity
1029578 you have to go to people and ask why did you stop smoking
1029579 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me
1029580 ive made good progress at notts and its been a lifelong ambition to take that forward for england
1029581 it hasnt sunk in yet but its all ive ever wanted ive been through the england ranks with the under 15s u17s and u19s and the end goal has always been to play for the senior side
1029582 samit has done very well in all forms of the game and his performances for notts have warranted this call up
1029583 its particularly pleasing that a local player has come through the notts academy and made it into the national squad a lot of people have coached him and helped him but hes done a lot for himself as well
1029584 hes a very committed player and this is the opportunity that hes been waiting for
1029585 darren will benefit from playing in the lions game and its a clear indicator that hes not been forgotten
1029586 it gives him another chance to play against south africa without the pressure of a test match environment and hopefully hell do well
1029587 well have to look at player availability when our england players go away and its certainly going to stretch the squad but it will also give some of our players a chance to shine in important fixtures
1029588 i was disappointed that michael vaughan made the decision to step down because a lot of people still believe that hes the best person to captain england in test match cricket but its a personal decision and one that he felt he had to make
1029589 tactically hell be fine he can handle himself well with the press and i dont think it will affect his game because hes mature enough to cope with the pressure
1029590 kp hit a century and took a wicket and i got 23 not out
1029591 i cant remember too much about his style of captaincy but hes got character and he brings character out of those around him as well
1029592 i just had a thought society brides in christchurch is also amazing michelle the owner also designs and her creations are just breathtaking worth a drive over i have heard from several of my brides that her customer service is just mind blowing
1029593 hey im not married yet in fact i dont even have my dress but if i did but if your a bride have the money insurance payout and time ive been there a couple of times for dress fittings and michelle is fab shes really booked up but may be able to pull something out the bag if not shed def be able to recommend someone
1029594 the best by far we visited all the shops in and around dorset and hampshire as well as a few more in london and none of them came close to society brides the owner michele was by far the most knowlegable about fashion and design out of all the shops wed been to the service we received was fantastic they couldnt do enough for us and all the time we felt that we were in safe hands highly recommended
1029595 fab service i recently got my dress from society brides in christchurch they were all superbly helpful and friendly that the whole experience was a complete pleasure their main designer michelle keffen spent a lot of time with us when she designed my dress and was sooo professional i cant put in to words how helpful they were and how happy i was with their service
1029596 i couldnt agree more when we visited them they were fantastic the staff were all really friendly and it felt genuine the designer we saw was superb and after a short conversation seemed to know exactly what we wanted certainly better than all the other shops we visited in the south including the whole of london
1029597 theres a shop in dorset that has its own range of dresses for beach weddings and they are gorgeous so lightweight and well made go to www societybrides com and have a look at their sunkissed range i think they do some mailorder but if you can get in to the shop you should the service is impecable i tried on fji its stunning especially if you have time to work on your tan before the wedding hope this helps
1029598 i have been to bridal stores all over bournemouth and sociey brides stands out way above the rest
1029599 i also got my dress in the bournemouth area from society brides and their service has been fantastic the dress i wanted was the top half of one dress and the bottom half of another because they have a designer on site who owns the shop this was no issue and it meant i got something no one else has there service has always been fantastic offered drinks good sense of humours and they do seem to really care i would definitely recommend them i did go to one shop in southampton called and in comparison the service was terrible i had booked and appointment and the lady was serving myself and someone else at the same time i did quite like a dress there but due to the poor service it would have concerned me too much to ever purchase one from them
1029600 hello i also had bad experiences in and in boscombe when i was looking for my dress and in southampton when i was looking for my bridesmaids i really dont understand how they would think that bad customer service will translate into sales by contrast in bournemouth where i finally found my dress and society brides in christchurch where i am buying my bridesmaid dresses couldnt have been more different really lovely experiences where nothing was too much trouble and you get a sense that they genuinely love the job that they do with the end result that they got my custom both these shops come highly recommended by me

1029602 the church is not a building the church is the people so it is easy for us to change venue where some people feel more comfortable
1029603 my customers at the beginning were a bit sceptical because they didnt know quite what to make of it all
1029604 we thought wed get together and see what we ended up with weve got a mix of people and a nice social event
1029605 its made me think about where to take my life

1029607 we believe in cctv as an almost absolute truth an above human system literally watching over us it defines a new urban reality how do we fit in this panopticonal reality and how do we know if we even exist in it does the system register our reality or its own if we are aware of being watched are we then still a suspect are we then still being watched

1029610 it seems amazing that heinz hasnt considered the power of social networking and new media to spread the story about a 70 price increase as it replaces its farleys brand with one called nurture
1029611 all quotes attributed to me on imao are made up including this one
1029612 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he did despair for in his omniscience he did know that his creations had but three fifths of the splendor of that which would be imao
1029613 the media seems preoccupied at the moment about peoples dna being stored centrally but the reality is that the database is really a one dimensional invasion of citizens privacy
1029614 two dimensional databases such as the planned telecommunications database of the numbers that people call from their landlines and mobile phones are much more worrying
1029615 not only do you have the numbers called and the locations called from but you have a time based diary from which you can extrapolate their movements
1029616 this has been a highly charged subject for years not least due to the progressive extension of the scope of the database culminating in recent proposals to include young children who might offend in the future or indeed everyone in the country
1029617 an attack on the government and party i have supported through thick and thin
1029618 by staying at the director marketing level dana will be limited in the scope of overarching strategic questions that could be logically posed to a vp marketing or ceo
1029619 some people might argue that social media usually turns out to be synonymous with expensive and time consuming and no clear benefit for the company
1029620 so i suggest that you identify your target audience carefully select the social media channel you want to show a presence in and then join the conversation with some caution focus on quality and benchmark your efforts based upon your goals
1029621 i said yesterday the best defensive team will win this
1029622 well there they are manchester north is the state champions and congratulations to them
1029623 this is a thrill but at the same time were awfully relieved
1029624 i knew we could put up some runs but i have to tell you im awfully proud of the four we held them to on the other side

1029637 rim is a competitor and has done a reasonable job in a space that is traditionally ours so its no great surprise that we see this as an opportunity to give consumers a proper choice on what e mail solutions they want
1029638 imagine how your board would feel if they discovered that a junior clerk had subverted controls to gain access to board members restricted network drives had the freedom to browse through payroll trading and research data and the facility to export this and other sensitive information such as business plans and customer databases without being detected in a financial services company we found a spreadsheet containing the domain admin passwords for each and every server and the quotes methodologies terms and reports from a number of competitors our assessments prove that this information can be readily accessed with very little knowledge and easily leaked out of the business

1029642 although the cm230ir will be widely considered for custodial applications we are looking at a broader market elevators interview rooms medical centres and stairwells are all areas for which the cm230ir is perfectly suited what all of these applications have in common is the need for a cctv solution that is integrated into the environment there is a balance between overt and covert cctv and the subtlety of the cm230irs design strikes this balance the option of 940nm ir which is invisible to the human eye is another feature that follows this subtle design thinking

1029666 with dhoni moving around with a posse of female guards these days girls like us have stopped thinking of him and instead started praying for a life partner having similar qualities
1029667 the idea of a devotional song featuring dhoni struck a few months ago we decided to release the song before shrawan which is the time girls come to shiva temples praying for a suitable life partner
1029668 dr williams may be the archbishop who has to accept that the circle can no longer be squared
1029669 its not just about nice people who want to include gay and lesbian christians and nasty people who want not to include them
1029670 the question is really what are the forms of behaviour that the church has the freedom or the authority to bless if it wants to be faithful to scripture and tradition
1029671 the gay issue simply doesnt look like going away and it will continue to divide conservatives and liberals
1029672 first the extremists or evangelicals or whatever else you choose to call the homophobes in the church when for some reason

1029697 we are paying for fighting it countries such as australia and england are our allies in this war on terror yet they are not supporting us here are we real allies or are we just being used
1029698 needless to say this accusation is totally false as can be evidenced by footage of sonu nigam that shows him distraught and terrified
1029699 this is india not norway boss if these guys are being offered 25 crores for a single vote i cant blame them for considering the offer seriously
1029700 what where am i and where the hells my lungi hey wtf i signed up for the f ck1ng national kaurava alliance
1029701 dawg you sure know to party maaaan but you dont wanna know what you did to karnas chariot wheel bearing and hub last night
1029702 i have said what i wanted it is for you all to interpret the rest
1029703 not just us but even the hindu right wing attest to the fact that terror attacks are done by the indian administration
1029704 when even manmohan singh can own you you have indeed hit rock bottom
1029705 the bjp governments policy weakness resulted from their assumption that the muslim minority is a fifth column of pakistan this exacerbated their notion that muslims in india could be appeased via foreign policy gymnastics read bending over backwards with pakistan
1029706 this has resulted in a continued fracturing between the right rss organization wing and the bjp vhp wing
1029707 one last question which countries are the pro hindutva people in this conversation from the reason being that pakistanis can come into conversations to polarize them thereby self fulfilling the notion that all indians are crafty hindus wanting to dominate them just a question eh
1029708 the section subscribing to a notion of civilization outside of their quotidian existence
1029709 i am also not surprised that bengalis amp muslims detest bjp
1029710 i argue that the latest attacks attempt to instigate this exact polarization by crystallizing muslim and hindu identities as abstract all encompassing identities that are mutually opposed by their very definition
1029711 congress also had similar vote share so by your logic kannadigas dont like congress as well
1029712 bjp never had a presence in karnataka it was always dominated by congress and morons like devegowda but if you look at the growth of bjp in karnataka and the voter demographics across the state you would understand that the 34 is a huge number
1029713 the section subscribing to a notion of civilization outside of their quotidian existence
1029714 in this particualr instance the ideological pan islamic ideology overwhelming the others decisively
1029715 i think that your assumption about this event is oversimplified for the event itself is a result of the polarization that never ceased in the first place only punctuated with individual events
1029716 our previous discussion about 7 months back regarding bangladesh and its creation is worth recalling identifying generational polarization as a a assumption to locate political debate is not dogma but realism
1029717 the debate on abortion is based on the subjective definition of morality and conscience quite different from our discussion
1029718 to answer your last remaining question i am originally from india live in washington dc
1029719 why must i not assume that indeed bjp themselves planted the bombs in their own state to blame the center
1029720 che che i am the moral guardian of your late night tv and u blame for organizing this
1029721 if the literate section believes in pan islamism then arrest them and or re educate them
1029722 substantial majorities in all but one of the predominantly muslim countries surveyed including as many as 85 in indonesia and 75 in morocco say that islam plays a very large or fairly large role in the political life of their countries
1029723 i am always right rest of you are dumb ass
1029724 you have given me results from a survey whose validity i do not know whose replicability i have not evaluated whose basic statistical operations and issues such as sampling error selection bias etc but does that make it right for us have we reduced ourselves to their status we have the law and we can create more transparent enforcement mechanisms that are neutrally applied i agree that law enforcement should be devoid of political influence
1029725 you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
1029726 made in china next time use a gun made in us
1029727 it manages to blast above the aesthetic limitations of the comic book hero genre
1029728 the interior ministry is presenting the federal bureau of investigation of the united states as a model for a similar indian agency and is proposing that the new agency like the fbi wont require the permission of state governments to investigate a specified list of crimes said a senior ministry official
1029729 aam aadmi actually has a say in the way the ib puts intelligence to use and shivraj patil runs home affairs
1029730 wont require the permission of state governments to investigate a specified list of crimes
1029731 i would prefer a bush right now who might attack the wrong people but at least he attacked and vented his anger enough to pause terrorism for some time
1029732 if there is anything greater than the tragedy of losing so many innocents to the shrapnel of jihadis it is this
1029733 another phenomenon resulting from a terrorist attack is the over exaggeration of the threat of terrorism
1029734 bush atleast did something in response to 9 11 is incorrect because all bush was doing was fulfilling his own right wing neo con dream of launching a war against a country for which he harboured deep prejudice
1029735 2 how about indore for starters it has all the makings of a backlash by the tormented minority backlash
1029736 the timing of the blasts in the run up to the general election posed the question
1029737 urged the government to form a high power neutral panel of retired judges human rights activists top lawyers and journalists
1029738 what am i going to do to solve this problem
1029739 but we all know that something like this is not going to happen there will just not be any sustained pressure from the citizens of the country to make such an agency a reality far less to make national security the number one hot button issue in the coming elections
1029740 all these may look insignificant but considering the fact that most of us pursue our jobs to keep our families and the society running and in addition may be inept in organization public speaking etc
1029741 im too brainwashed into believing in liberal democracy of which secularism is a very important pillar
1029742 of the forty six sovereign states that make up the international islamic conference only one the turkish republic can be described as a democracy and even they have faced numerous obstacles in their path to democracy of the remainder some have never tried democracy others have tried it and failed a few more recently have experimented with the idea of sharing though not of relinquishing power
1029743 i see more and more diffidence in them muslims in gujarat have realised that there is no solution of the issue communal politics
1029744 the large terrorist group must have taken the support of local people but i dont see the widespread support of gujarati muslims to such violence at all
1029745 the terrorists have served twin goals by hitting bjp dominated areas they have sent the message to the chief minister that his claim of security is hollow in spite of a red alert in the city they have shown their capacity to strike at places they want second by hitting hospitals in a cruel and dastardly manner they have caused the maximum damage
1029746 discuss politics and not the done to death religious angles please
1029747 oh boy just lost the argument so lets call it a joke routine
1029748 if you were on that boat in batman i am sure you would have blown the other people up to stay alive kahani mein khujur twist try living with yourself after that there are things in life worse than death
1029749 i was under the misapprehension that the debate was based on the fact that turkey was the only muslim country to be a democracy
1029750 i think maybe if you expanded your statement to say that christianity islam judaism hinduism and all the religions in the world are incompatible with democracy i would agree with you
1029751 those indians who consider india to be a hindu country have absolutely no right to sneer at muslim countries which are not secular
1029752 our belief system is the religion of peace our belief system is the religion of peace our belief system is the religion of peace
1029753 this then is what i have to say to you
1029754 and like ive said a million times i see no difference in your world view and that of an islamic fundamentalist for godsake your admitted goal is the conversion sorry reconversion of the muslims of india just the way muslim and christain fundamentalists want to convert everyone else how are you any different
1029755 across africa asia and the middle east including india republic of korea nigeria and indonesia
1029756 he realized he was being followed and slipped into the woods
1029757 we are not against hindus and amarnath yatra but we are against the transfer of land to sasb the muslims have been at the forefront to provide all possible help to the yatris during the annual pilgrimage over the years however now the sasb is communalizing the issue
1029758 it is a conspiracy to civil occupation and to change the muslim character of the valley
1029759 is jammu and kashmir hostage to hate politics between communities
1029760 why was not there one presumably structure rails tunnels last year there has been none for one hunderd and sixty years why now
1029761 i can still understand kashmiris feeling strongly about what happens on their soil but a man in bhopal being beaten up by hoodlums who know precious little doesnt sound fair to me
1029762 just as there is no denying the plight of kashmiri pandits being hounded out by islamic insurgents there is also no denying the discovery of the amarnath shrine by a muslim family and the continued hospitality extended by a majority muslim population to a hindu pilgrimage over the years
1029763 i am prepared to give some benefit of doubt to the kashmiri protestors since the chances of their knowing what is happening in their neighborhood and the relevance of their views to whats happening there are unquestionably greater than some less informed person in another part of the country who are being mobilized based on some vague pan nationalistic obscurantist arguments not to say that some amount of propagandizing is not used to rouse kashmiri sentiments as well but thats what politics is all about
1029764 i dont even think that it is well established that the train fire was started by a muslim mob according to a government report the burn patterns suggested the fire had started inside not outside the compartment
1029765 i do not understand why the nation should pay for haj never have
1029766 kashmir issue is not a ethnic issue kashmiri muslims who are children of hindus who were converted and kashmiri hindus who now live in refugee camps and get 400 rupees a month per family are both ethnically kashmiris this is a purely religious issue
1029767 in your worldview an infection with arabian origins has infested our national body and you have the full backing of a glorious history to support your views delight then in the grand delusions of the past and try and rescue us poor mortals from our wallowing in the infected present
1029768 i am sorry and embarrassed that i am a hindu the process of islamic republic of india has begun run when you still can
1029769 there is a whole lot of ambiguity about the burning of the train a lot of it must be conspiracy theorizing
1029770 the fact that you can use my template to voice your own thoughts only reinforces all that is common in our experience of being indian denial of rights and alienation from our fellow countrymen but along with that a belief that change will come and the need to strive towards that change if anything that should make it easier for us to understand each others plight
1029771 really 60 hindu women and children burnt alive by a 10 islamic minority ambiguity and conspiracy theory then muslims causing 30 of the total casualty in the ensuing riots inspite of forming just 10 of the population well planned pogrom by the 90 hindus
1029772 i have lost brothers fellow humans and i lose them everyday
1029773 at this point of time the biggest ideology of pure hate is expressed in the koran
1029774 i have lost brothers fellow humans and i lose them everyday
1029775 at this point of time the biggest ideology of pure hate is expressed in the koran
1029776 i have so far not seen a single response disproving either their existence or their interpretation
1029777 the indian govt identifies more with the majority community and vice versa thus it can take over hindu religious trusts
1029778 isnt it better that the govt manages these trusts than the corruption associated with clerics and priests
1029779 you are far from an expert in the stance you purport to represent
1029780 as as hindus i believe i owe it to humanity to bring them back to hinduism and do my bit to destroy islam
1029781 love is better than hatred peace is better than war
1029782 ah our m brothers are not satisfied with reservations and article 370 amp sharia and mass breeding campaigns let us impose jizzya on ourselves and pledge our firstborn daughters to their pleasures just as gandhi would have wanted
1029783 have you found a single response approving their existense and interpretation
1029784 all religions have fundamnetally the same laws of good and bad
1029785 it all boils down to what you want to believe
1029786 im just trying to say that love is better than hatred peace is better than war
1029787 isnt it better that the govt manages these trusts than the corruption associated with clerics and priests
1029788 i wish i can be like you when i grow up
1029789 do you give out incense sticks with it too and marigold flowers
1029790 an indian govt elected by an electroate which is 85 hindu does all this right
1029791 be sad about the fact that we arent as secular as a lot of other countries
1029792 i am with you give firmness to the believers i will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger tips of them
1029793 it will be said take him and fetter him and expose him to hell fire and then insert him in a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits lo he used not to believe in god the tremendous and urged not on the feeding of the wretched therefore hath he no lover hear this day nor any food save filth which none but sinners eat
1029794 the atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word dus
1029795 i am a management consultant blah blah thus i am far more informed than you blah blah that is why in any sincere debate that focuses on facts we win hands down blah blah
1029796 the petition by chandmal chopra also led to many riots in india and bangladesh
1029797 at least 12 people were killed and 100 wounded all are poor hindus
1029798 one more thing i have my reservations with sincerity and accuracy of media politically motivated as well as wikipedia anyone can edit it so lets not get into this whose the victim game
1029799 regarding context of verses of quran let me clarify that i am not a islamic scholar so i will have to search for the right context of each and every verses you have quoted hence i request you to short list 4 5 of the verses which you find most offensive and i will try to explain with my limited knowledge them to you
1029800 the amarnath issue lead to riots in indore when over enthusiastic bjp and other saffronwallahs tried to force down shutters for bharath bandh
1029801 but what i know for certain is that cases reported w
1029802 i am quite certain that you just copied text from wikipedia and pasted it on this site without even reading them
1029803 fight not with them at the inviolable place of worship until they first attack you there
1029804 the quran is in its original pristine arabic as it was revealed from allah the word for god in arabic someone new to these verses may not fully understand the verses and may take them out of context
1029805 bt no one in hinduism has gone on to become an osama or alike ppl havnt become suicide bombers
1029806 hhbb kannan sunil bhopale dodo anonymous coward vibhash and rishi khujur keep up the good work mates
1029807 no one is doubting the sincerity but hate begets more hate
1029808 we feel thats the basic difference between partitioned india and india at the root of all of this is unemployment and poverty
1029809 what if in some saarc forum leaders of pakistan and bangladesh declare that they want to re merge with india
1029810 farooq shiekh defended us by saying that it was hindus who protested the most loudly there is an amazing story on how a sikh guru prevented aurangzeb from forcibly converting pandits to islam
1029811 and then his son guru gobind singh broke that might tyrant with a defiant poem
1029812 you fucks who want a hindu state have no idea about the zeitgeist of indian secularism and no what is happening in india is not secularism
1029813 you have got to ask yourself whether this is a constructive way of engaging muslims
1029814 fyi the prophet repeatedly mentions throughout the koran that one should draw their own conclusions by following an imam blindly a muslim has failed his spiritual quest
1029815 to blame the koran and to regard it as a mind control device is meaningless inflammatory and downright stupid
1029816 a conspiracy is abound to take away what is rightly ours
1029817 but how much can you do living the good life in the us
1029818 hara by his own admission is already a legend in his own lifetime
1029819 half a million people climbing up the glaciers does cause a lot of ecological damage
1029820 there is a general feeling in the valley that it is discriminated against by the powers that be in new delhi this feeling started some 60 years back and has only deepened with the passage of events
1029821 talk to an average kashmiri and you can feel the mistrust under the surface of course a lot of it is true as can be seen by the recent issue of the discovery of mass graves
1029822 human rights violations committed by the armed forces of india continue in an atmosphere of impunity thats what a kashmiri means when he says that he feels like a second class citizen in india
1029823 a convert from christianity to islam pickthall was a novelist esteemed by d h lawrence h g wells and e m forster as well as a journalist headmaster and political and religious leader he declared his islam in dramatic fashion after delivering a talk on islam and progress on november 29 1917 to the muslim literary society in notting hill west london
1029824 a strong advocate of the ottoman empire even prior to declaring his faith as a muslim
1029825 when a propaganda campaign was launched in the uk in 1915 over the massacres of armenians pickthall rose to challenge it and argued that all the blame could not be placed on the turkish government
1029826 pickthall said he was ready to be a combatant for his country so long as he did not have to fight the turks
1029827 but for the man on the ground it seems like the first in a series of steps designed to further alienate him to him many promises have been broken in the past and he is very wary of any new thing
1029828 yes i do agree that islam is a monotheistic religion and severe punishment has been promised for wrong doers and those who worship anyone but the almighty
1029829 mleccha nivaha nidhane kalayasi karavalam dhumaketum iva kim api karalam kesava dhrita kalki sarira jaya jagadisa hare
1029830 kill kufr rape kufr wimmen and men three ways enslave kufr children impale babu bajrangi
1029831 and as far as a licking of hhbbs success goes he sure has achieved a quite a lot in the first 29 years of his life but just for your information by the grace of almighty i am a mba from the topmost b school in france no need to mention what its name is and i am just 26
1029832 we had dharshan of the icelingum in the holy cave on june 29 and returned to baltal on june 30 morning but were not allowed to proceed to srinagar by the jammu and kashmir police
1029833 unfortunately it looks like the curse on kashmir is not yet over
1029834 any particle will be in an agitated state until it returns to its undisturbed natural state of harmony which is the core of every being the ultraviolence seen in kashmir indonesia pakistan afghanistan bangladesh malaysia and other converted lands today is a result of the agitation produced in peoples minds due to conversion to a foreign way of life when all its peoples return to their true intrinsic state of dharma they will find their peace that is at the core of their hearts until then the violence will continue just like a ship battered by a storm that is brought about by foreign winds churning up the water into gigantic waves when the foreign winds subside and go away then the storm ceases and the water becomes still and attains a calm state of being that is its harmonic state
1029835 for over 1 300 years with no recrimination or retaliation
1029836 they massacred their minorites so well and look at us gutless indians we couldnt carry out a proper genocide also damn
1029837 the courts have banned bandhs and hartals in the country on the basis that it disrupts public life why not apply the same logic to the pujas
1029838 he will in most likelihood analyze conclude how a bunch individuals who still have humanity left in them fought off hordes of murderous and genocidal religious fanatics
1029839 merging not linking all these rivers as a solution to the floods in some of them
1029840 as reports of violence started coming in by noon of 28th february 2002 the state government after assessing the situation decided to call in the army and initiated a verbal request to army authorities at 14 30 hours and the decision was announced by the hon cm in the press conference of 1630 hours on the same day on the request of the state government the central government issued orders for shifting necessary army personnel to ahmedabad on the same days evening thus the state government made quick assessment of the situation and the army was called in from distant places in less than 16 hours after the arrival of army at ahmedabad after discussions with the state government and the goc of the army it was decided to deploy the first arrival of army in the disturbed areas of ahmedabad city the district administration arranged for executive magistrates to accompany the army and the deployment began from 1100 hours on 1st march to disturbed areas of vejapur meghaninagar asarva bapunagar shaherkotda khadia dariapur rakhial paldi etc the next brigade of the army was also deployed in rajkot and vadodra on 01 03 2002 itself three columns allotted to godhra reached in godhra lunavada and halol on the early morning of 02 03 2002 thereafter the army has been shifted in surat and bhavnagar as and when the situation warranted such a shift
1029841 so the benefit for the pujas also accrue only to hindus how difficult is this for you to comprehend
1029842 you babble mercilessly when i give you proof you babble mercilessly when i dont
1029843 nooooooooo girls are baaaaaad and my parents wont do something yucky like this they are nice people
1029844 isnt that what you guys have been doing even after
1029845 yes i do agree that islam is a monotheistic religion and severe punishment has been promised for wrong doers and those who worship anyone but the almighty
1029846 correct me if i am wrong which i am quite certain i am not doesnt other religions hinduism included promise severe punishment to people not conforming to their respective believes
1029847 what will happen to a person his soul or aatma actually who has done everything prohibited in hinduism in his lifetime when he dies
1029848 you see in hindu dharma depending on the what darshana you delve into the soul aatman and the absolute brahmann not to be confused with brahmin or brahma very much follow the law of conservation of energy
1029849 really to go into the history of india since the 12th century might be a bit tedious but then maybe its necessary for misguided soul
1029850 you must understand that the history of india isnt yr avg hindi film with a hero and a villain its a lot grayer than that let me give you some example to show you that indias history is not a hindu vs muslim monologue
1029851 and this one i think clinches it you say that for 1300 years indian history is a long story of muslim rulers oppressing their hindu subjects right
1029852 for over 1 300 years with no recrimination or retaliation
1029853 if i am a pro h bigot then by distorting history beyond belief and offering facile and banal arguments that hold no water to counter volumes of irrefutable fact you are an anti h bigot and an ignorant one at that too
1029854 so basically you are regretful of the fact that india isnt as fundamentalist as pakistan right
1029855 they massacred their minorites so well and look at us gutless indians we couldnt carry out a proper genocide also damn
1029856 if you call not conducting genocides and mass murder campaigns
1029857 after all theres no better way to show that yr not a coward than by murdering a few hundred women and children in cold blood right
1029858 anyway i dont take myself so seriously ya know i am just the piano player sideshow freakshow in this carnivale on that note wheres shan
1029859 hhbb im sorry my comment did not feckin help you i would rather not be your mate for anything its not you its me
1029860 balalsangh parivar is very similar in writing style to the wanderer the prose is so good
1029861 in general there is a certain assumption that you make i e im is and has been good for nothing so mark my words this is your hubris and why your cause and efforts are doomed to be a failure
1029862 ha ha you think deducting a few crores to fly people to arabia is the
1029863 if i am a pro h bigot then by distorting history beyond belief and offering facile and banal arguments that hold no water to counter volumes of irrefutable fact you are an anti h bigot and an ignorant one at that too
1029864 we should have been as secular as pakistan and bangladesh where a 35 pre partition population has plummeted to 0 6 in pak
1029865 then and then alone you are a hindu when every man who bears the name from any country speaking our language or any other language becomes at once the nearest and the dearest to you then and then alone you are a hindu when the distress of anyone bearing that name comes to your heart and makes you feel as if your own son were in distress then and then alone you are a hindu when you will be ready to bear everything for them like the great example i have quoted at the beginning of this lecture of your great guru govind singh
1029866 how do you know that the sepoys who had requested bsz to be king were hu
1029867 most of the bengal army consisted of hindus do read up more before making an embarrassing statement like that
1029868 the sepoys and the company tradition and transition in northern india 1770 1830 by seema alavi
1029869 i am not anybodys naukar to go and help anybody
1029870 communal hatred led to ugly communal riots in many parts of up the green flag was hoisted and bloody wars were fought between hs and ms in bareilly bijnor moradabad and other places where the ms shouted for revival of the mm kingdom
1029871 ms spat over hs and openly defiled their houses by sprinkling them with cows blood and placing cows bones within the compounds the hs oppressed by ms were depressed at the success of the mutiny and daily offered prayers to god for the return of the english
1029872 if scindia joins the rebels i will pack off tomorrow
1029873 these princes acted as the breakwaters to the storm which otherwise would have swept us in one great wave
1029874 tipus reign isnt what im looking for as of now
1029875 could anything suggest muslim pluralism to you without any proof of what constitutes mm pluralism in the present world to you
1029876 its no fun having a debate without turning your opponents own words against him now is there
1029877 the mix of sepoys in bengal bombay amp madras were 3 hu to 1 mm
1029878 after rebelling the leaderless sepoys needed a figurehead to grant them legitimacy and bsz fit the bill as the most pliable and least ambitious leader the others marathas or awadhis would be bound to have vested interests
1029879 brutalised them hindus for over 1 300 years with no recrimination or retaliation
1029880 couldnt agree more but the very fact that zafar was asked to lead albeit only as a figurehead the revolt puts paid to your notions of constant warfare between the two religions
1029881 bakht khan denied help to the nimach brigade when it was led by sidhara singh and hira singh
1029882 i am not anybodys naukar to go and help anybody
1029883 the rebellion could not assume a pan indian form precisely because of bsz
1029884 tipus reign isnt what im looking for as of now
1029885 could anything suggest muslim pluralism to you without any proof of what constitutes mm pluralism in the present world to you
1029886 so much about the theory that it was a golden period of unblemished hu mm amity with all previous grievances forgotten
1029887 i assure you the di chrome scenario is not reality it is not even your imagination it is your manufacture without it you have no point at all so your insistence to cling to this
1029888 which country in the world tolerates people who have brutalised them for over 1 300 years with no recrimination or retaliation
1029889 we should have been as secular as pakistan and bangladesh where a 35 pre partition population has plumetted to 0 6 in pak
1029890 at no level do i see any urge of solidarity or promotion of nation building on their the muslims part at best i see stark apathy to india not even a trace of gratitude for wresting a nation massacring hs amp ss from there and then obstinately refusing to leave as any decent human being would at worst i see seething discontent dangerous indoctrination in the sprawling madrasahs and a contrived population explosion
1029891 im is about blutlust sic about nihilism while there are hs they will create justifications for destroying hs then when the last h is murdered they will immediately invent reasons for wiping out buddhists then jews then xtians ultimately when the non m world reverberates in the silence of the dead the ms will then start slaughtering each other
1029892 you amp i amp yourfan2 amp hujur et all may desperately try to stem the rot at considerable personal risk expense and investment of time and resource
1029893 im really sorry to prick you balloon and bring you down to earth but all you are doing is having a small little debate on the comments section of a weblog with a 22 year old whose just cleared his engineering course
1029894 sikhs did not join in the conflict as they hated the purbeas and not because of antipathy to the mughals as i had mentioned as proof there were skhs and ms in punjab regiments
1029895 im sorry to prick you balloon but all you are doing is having a small little debate with a 22 year old
1029896 how do you know most of the sepoys who had requested this i e requested bsz to accept leadership were hu
1029897 acceptance of bszs overlordship by the sepoys is proof of hu mm amity and thus proof that mms did not treat hs with relentless brutality
1029898 sikhs not joining the rebellion because they hated the purbeas
1029899 im really sorry to prick you balloon and bring you down to earth but all you are doing is having a small little debate on the comments section of a weblog with a 22 year old whose just cleared his engineering course
1029900 if you are looking for 100 of the muslim kings practising 100 hu slaughter 100 of the time over 100 of their kingdoms you will never find it even the ensatzgruppen could not sustain such a tempo
1029901 an exclusive financial corporation will fund and arrange the christians visit to the holy shrines its on the lines of the arrangements made for muslims going on the haj pilgrimage to mecca

1029912 for a limited time lenovo is providing windows xp recovery cd media as a way to downgrade from windows vista
1029913 the issue here is not getting the right person in office its making it less crucial to have the right person in office
1029914 what we used to call garage cinema we now call social media
1029915 my first starting job was as a running back against umass on homecoming and we did a double reverse i went 65 yards outran a kid grady fuller who ran a sub 4 4 40 yard dash and i outran him i went around this kid like he was standing still the coaches kept rewinding it because this kid was an all american and stuff so i had the reverse for the touchdown i had two touchdowns that day and i had 85 yards on the ground and 65 in receptions for 150 and we won 42 16 or something like that
1029916 you look at our schedule yeah weve got some tough contests but theyre going to be at home for the most part
1029917 were going to be at the friendly confines of bridgeforth
1029918 obviously kentucky would be his dream job and you could make the argument that if he and gillispie switched places they might both be more comfortable
1029919 a forecast for relatively cooler weather this week will be beneficial for
1029920 even the heat that has occurred recently was accompanied by humidity so desiccation was not a major concern
1029921 in any case the corn futures market has bearish momentum

1029925 an informative humorous and most importantly well written site on the twin cities real estate market
1029926 if this is all you can come up with for an article then you are a disgrace to the human race you bleep face
1029927 thanks for making me feel like a real estate geek again
1029928 the strict implementation of cellphone ban will strengthen the bureaus drive against human trafficking and most importantly it effectively prevents corruption
1029929 a lot of times people will come in and get the kind of customer service only a place like this can give they get expertise on what camera to buy and then they leave and go on the internet and buy a camera for the cheapest price possible
1029930 there will be games that will be enhanced by the wii motionplus as well as games that can only be played with it
1029931 users will need four if they have four controllers but were going to try to offer it for as little as possible we havent announced the price yet but the cost of making the wii motionplus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable
1029932 most of the ideas for accessories that we had initially come up with are out now we might think up some more and we might make them if we do but we dont have any plans to release a whole lot more
1029933 the hardware team started work on the next thing as soon as they were done with their previous project but what they think up doesnt necessarily become a product
1029934 we only turn something into a product after its been thoroughly vetted inside the company were not at a point where we can give specifics but of course were working on it
1029935 it becomes easy to get caught up in the salacious details and drop the restraint that has marked the n amp os responsible approach to the john edwards alleged mistress
1029936 edwards is now after all a private figure and theres a point where examining his sex life doesnt serve a public interest and risks turning a respectable newspaper into the news and enquirer
1029937 i had done two years of my three year contract and they let me off the last year they still paid me the money to go i had got a 300 000 a year contract i went for a footballers contract i was totally taking the piss i didnt spend much time on them and they were such arrant crap i also never left any forwarding numbers or anything and just went off for the weekend it was then that i realised i had lost my mojo

1029940 if i am going to be honest it didnt take me very long because i recycled a lot of stuff
1029941 my publishers hate it when i say things like that but my only green instinct is to recycle a load of my material people know i am going to do it anyway
1029942 you should have seen it before it was damned good it was so rude
1029943 tony thinks were having this feud but i see it as a camp knockabout thing something amusing
1029944 im not cross with him he cant see that he is a ridiculous person when i think of being married to him i wonder what i was playing at i know i was on drugs but nobody is on that many drugs
1029945 i count myself as a fairly ridiculous person id like to add i certainly dont let myself off the hook things like my voice and going to church drunk other people want to hide from themselves i sometimes just look at myself in the mirror and just make myself laugh so much
1029946 well i suppose my defence would be that i wanted to see what it felt like for once in my life to be hypocritical
1029947 also we only got 2 000 for the serialisation which i think is rubbish money its hardly enough for martinis for a frigging weekend so it doesnt feel so bad
1029948 everybody knows that hacks are the biggest bunch of adulterers the most misbehaving profession in the world and you have people writing for the daily mail writing as though they are vicars moralising on single mothers and whatnot
1029949 it was one of those things that suffered with a change of personnel at itv
1029950 i think my problem was sugar rush it was taken out of my hands by someone who knew totally what he was doing and so it took under a year to get on screen
1029951 its hard for me because everything works so much more quickly in journalism i dont like sitting around and waiting for things to happen
1029952 doesnt have an interest in television writing any more i cant be arsed
1029953 its what i would call a cushy billet i am a lazy person these days and i measure things in terms of how much of a skive they are and that would have been one fuck of a skive i love the sun and i watch all those programmes they review anyway but its ally rosss job so i cant very well say well get out can i i would have been annoyed if somebody else had got it
1029954 i started working when i was 17 and its a long time to write day in day out most people dont start until they are 21 or 22 and i suppose i have been living my life backwards when i was a teenager i was working hard now i am lolling around and having fun
1029955 why do i say these things its not that im brave its that i lack certain sensible genes a coward dies a thousand deaths they say and i have to die once i suppose i dont feel regret or shame and people may say its foolhardy but im not dead yet and i thought i would be but i am going to be 50 soon
1029956 with my gout its like the blind leading the blind
1029957 and they have army in their title i told them not to get all meek on me
1029958 thats what i get excited about these days not writing a stupid little column
1029959 its not that i turned against journalism overnight its a gradual wearing away over time i dont want to keep saying things until i drop down dead i want to have 10 years where i keep my own counsel perhaps i have always been miss rentagob since i was a kid and i dont want to be that person any more
1029960 with games like ours you get much more controversy when you add motion controls like you saw with manhunt 2
1029961 we have weapons like chainsaws satchel charges stuff like that i can definitely see people having a problem and outcry towards that because it does actually feel like youre using weapons that way
1029962 at volition were really about pushing really good graphics and with the wii you just feel like youre playing on an older console

1029967 die vielen studien die zur wolkenbeeinflussung gemacht wurden zeigen keinen signifikanten effekt
1029968 i noticed a sign on the mural that has decorated the eastern end wall of the restaurant for years now it said that the mural is for sale when i asked the waiter why they were selling it he said that they were expanding the space so the mural had to go
1029969 the whole block is moving down a notch were moving into their space and theyre moving into the next space
1029970 effective on even date herewith the parties hereto hereby agree to
1029971 i think my overall reaction is that its really sad that in 2008 i have people watching every single move i make
1029972 when theres a big game between the cubs and brewers going on its sad that thats what their focus is on and the last thing i had heard is that when you want to do a story on someone you contact them
1029973 with that said i still think reporters should hold themselves to the highest professional standard i found her dress to be inappropriate for the workplace even some brewers players said that although shes great to look at the dress wasnt appropriate for the ballpark
1029974 and i know what all the guys out there are going to say trenni is just being catty because shes jealous
1029975 theres no excuse for being out the weekend before camp
1029976 site wide global tagging scheme started back in february of 2006 tags came along in september 2007
1029977 o advogado da atriz rejeitou repetidamente as tentativas dos agentes federais de interrog la
1029978 a um grande j ri uma intima o para obrig la a contar tudo o que sabe
1029979 todo o mundo colaborou ressaltando a grande pessoa que era heath ledger todos menos mary kate que se recusou a falar
1029980 a testemunha necess ria para encerrar a investiga o sobre quem forneceu as drogas e os rem dios
1029981 os federais entraram em contato v rias vezes com o advogado da atriz michael miller buscando sua coopera o mas ele disse que mary kate n o ser interrogada a menos que obtenha a imunidade perante a possibilidade de ser acusada no caso exercendo assim seus direitos constitucionais
1029982 os agentes da dea tamb m foram agressivos com o departamento de pol cia de nova york
1029983 tiveram que amea ar pedir uma intima o antes de poder obter o arquivo de ledger
1029984 this situation in our tribal areas is similar to that of pre 9 11 afghanistan state authority in those regions has nearly ended militants fighting in both pakistan and afghanistan now control this area which threatens the whole region
1029985 we have repeatedly demanded a solution to this situation because we do not want these regions to turn into the battleground of a global conflict as global powers respond to the threats emanating from these regions might be tempted to intervene militarily
1029986 the people of fata are hostages in the hands of the militants and the federal government has allowed that because they have not really tried to clear these regions from armed bands
1029987 so on the one hand people in fata have been threatened by the militants on the other the government still wants to perpetuate discriminatory laws in that region
1029988 now when the foreigners u s and nato forces intervene in these regions they only rely on military means long range artillery and aerial bombing
1029989 the arab militants are fighting their war against the united states on pashtun soil pakistan and india too want to fight their conflict on pashtun soil and the pashtuns are dying as a result
1029990 a whole generation of pashtun youth in swat dir and other war ravaged regions are deprived of education as their schools are closed
1029991 what i see is deeply disturbing the destruction that we have seen so far is nothing and six months from now people will remember the current state as being a lot better
1029992 but some fighting will go on while there is parallel economic development and education also has to go on to move the whole situation towards normalcy but now we have not even started to move that way and the whole situation is going towards further destruction and bloodshed
1029993 to go to work on the most important issue of the day and thats the rising gas prices
1029994 juande ramos has been there and done it and i have great respect for him
1029995 i have seen what he has done with the other players i talked to the lads before i came here and they said hes great its hard work but thats what i want i want to work hard and enjoy myself and juande can develop my game and push me on to the next level
1029996 it is right that many clubs in england were interested in taking me but my favorite from the first meeting was tottenham because i am a big fan of coach ramos
1029997 i want to play for tottenham in international football champions league or uefa cup games
1029998 i want to achieve big things with the club and be in the top group of teams in the premier league
1029999 aceasta situatie nu va face decat sa mareasca confuzia si ingrijorarea printre cetateni in legatura cu situatia imigrantilor din italia
