3440000 walking all over it and kicking that felt polar bear
3440001 no one on the staff knows what we really do
3440002 the relevance of corporate citizenship is accelerating thats why the centers thought leadership is so essential

3440007 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3440008 it was more than loved it looked like it had been to world war three and back again
3440009 we thought thats cool it doesnt matter what its made of or what it looks like hes skating we like the dedication
3440010 hes good enough but those africans are mean runners so getting to the final could be the hardest part they will either sit around and sprint or go crazy from the start and either way he will need to respond
3440011 willis has been there before which is to his advantage and youve got to remember he is the commonwealth games champion
3440012 the council own the section and the guides own the hall
3440013 it was one way to remind people of the history of studholme and the nukuroa settlement
3440014 she draws a great crowd the last concert was a sell out because of her with more than 350 people in the basilica
3440015 people still talk about that concert so we think this one will be a sell out too
3440016 last time dame malvina was here she commented on how great the acoustics were and said before the project was completed she would love to sing here again and we said we might have to hold her to that
3440017 there are 10 000 needy families on the waiting list that need housing if they do it more than once they deserve to be out on the street and the home given to more needy families
3440018 as a result of this review the corporation is taking a more assertive consistent and targeted approach to managing this issue
3440019 housing new zealand made almost 13 000 applications to the tenancy tribunal in the 2007 2008 year
3440020 it is pretty disturbing when you see civilian buildings destroyed
3440021 there was a very loud bang and then you start thinking that must have been a bomb because we are actually at war
3440022 first you feel shock then disbelief you cant really believe that a bomb has just been dropped close to where you are living and then you wait and see if theres a second bomb
3440023 i feel safe here in tbilisi but if it gets worse we will think about evacuating pretty smartly
3440024 the plan is to stay here until we consider the situation dangerous enough that we should really get out
3440025 i wasnt very happy that we came last it wasnt ever going to happen again
3440026 everyone tried really hard we got the best out of everyone
3440027 the danger of beating the system is that it puts you on death row
3440028 she nearly lost her own life and that of her baby through delay and perhaps even the transfusion
3440029 although the patients previous record indicated that he had undergone previous surgery there were no scars to prove it
3440030 the blood group of the sample taken from the patient did not match the group in the records from previous admissions this was identified before any incorrect group blood was given
3440031 the result was a delay in transfusion and the patients life was placed at a significant and unnecessary risk
3440032 whats happening is that they are non residents trying to capitalise on the system here because there is no facility for non residents and they have to pay
3440033 it is dangerous and we would like people to stop doing it
3440034 very vigilant about who is eligible and who is not
3440035 we had to use force and began using a blowtorch but once one hinge had been blasted off they decided to open the door
3440036 you will have to pay your fines even if you are a gang hiding behind fortified doors it has caught up with them items have been seized which they treasure
3440037 we must cater for diversity we know it exists by this i mean the range of relationships from single couples triples blended de facto and so on thats where were going with social policy
3440038 its entirely my responsibility what goes out under my name so its my fault that i didnt know that a speech that i hadnt given had been put on the website
3440039 i get speeches a lot that i dont give i dont want to be too critical of people who draft my speeches but i get a lot of speeches in draft that i never use they have no relationship with what i say
3440040 i havent bothered asking because im not interested in it
3440041 the social security legislation is very clear about what a relationship is youre either single or a couple a couple is in the nature of marriage which includes civil union and de facto
3440042 its been the same for years its been tested in court theres no interest in changing it
3440043 i get draft speeches from the department all the time sometimes its msd sometimes its dol department of labour sometimes its health sometimes its education it depends what the speech is
3440044 ive got no idea im sort of not interested because i didnt say it and its not our policy
3440045 there would be nobody in msd who is under any illusion that that is government policy
3440046 it sounds like a secret agenda to me i dont think that speeches miraculously appear on the governments website without anyone knowing who put them there
3440047 i know what she would be saying if it was us
3440048 now includes something called triples and my mind just boggles
3440049 failure to implement new zealands cancer control strategy according to agreed timelines will cost new zealand many deaths from preventable cancer
3440050 what is the point of detecting cancer if we dont have the people equipment and medicines to treat it
3440051 it is clear from the way new zealanders consume alcohol and the harms that result that we need to make real and enduring changes
3440052 it is expected that consideration of alcohol limits and possible solutions will be a key part
3440053 in order to strengthen and restore nevada countys economic freedom and prosperity and to maintain its healthy environment cabpro works for lower fees and taxes less government regulation and preservation of property rights for all residents and business property and resource owners
3440054 our property is protected by a conservation easement held by the nevada county land trust the conservation easement precludes granting of an access easement in fact it makes it illegal to grant such easements
3440055 the question of how you handle mps remuneration can be quite controversial
3440056 we decided since quiescence had arrived in that area it was probably not good for us to reopen it
3440057 this still does not mean that we have a healthy viable population with anywhere near historic population numbers
3440058 while the improvement for humpback and southern right whales is positive there is still a need to foster population recovery and an international effort is needed
3440059 we must remember that although the international population is making a comeback some pacific groups of whales remain in a perilous state
3440060 i think its time to call for a moratorium on the aerial spread of 1080
3440061 at the end of the day if word of aerial 1080 distribution becomes common talk amongst our clients in north america and europe i think my concession would be worth next to nothing if i dont get any visitors
3440062 if were going to protect 100 per cent pure new zealand then eco tourism is the only apparent option for each and every tourism operator
3440063 we just want to retain the small area on waikanae beach where we take our kids and know theyll be safe
3440064 we just want to retain the small area on waikanae beach where we take our kids and know theyll be safe from the risk of being approached and chased by unleashed dogs
3440065 kids are brought up to have fun on the beach run around throw their arms in the air dig in the sand splash in the water kick a ball fly a kite which dogs may misinterpret and find threatening
3440066 what about fish and chips on the beach for dinner
3440067 the council has a duty to consider childrens safety people have the right to access kapitis main public places without intimidation fear or nuisance from dogs which can cause great distress to children and other beach users
3440068 luckily the sharp eyed people at the airport spotted it and saved us a long long search
3440069 fortunately the car park boss who should be made an honorary member of the club after this waived every single penny and let us take the car for free
3440070 a blunt instrument in trying to solve deep seated and underlying issues within families
3440071 i thought the police would have got us both in and told us to straighten it out between us instead of charging me
3440072 the police love nothing better than a high profile target
3440073 its fair to say the pictures are not high definition for this reason i will not be spending any more time on them
3440074 i think fair minded kiwis will see this for the dirty trick it is
3440075 nobody locally can remember there being the sort of circumstances we have got right now the snow is exceptionally deep with snowdrifts of two to three metres and the potential for further avalanches is very high right now
3440076 in 30 years climbing in these ranges i have never seen conditions like it we were climbing in blizzard conditions and it was reminiscent of the high southern alps in winter
3440077 the biggest issue as freshmen coming in is can they mentally handle the schemes and the pace those two have shown they can so far theyve done enough to convince us they can contribute as freshmen and i think as much mentally as physically
3440078 theyre both fast explosive players that i think are good with the spread system so were excited about it as much as anything i like the way they practice coming here in the summer helped theyre practicing like theyve been here longer than a couple weeks
3440079 i thought coming in there would be 9 or 10 true freshmen that have an opportunity to play and thats probably going to be the case
3440080 nobodys a voice leader you lead by example by playing the game right thats how you lead
3440081 you feel like a caged tiger what are you talking about
3440082 you say po tay to i say po tah to
3440083 gary sheffield hasnt been platooned here platooning is when you have a left handed hitter and a right handed hitter one plays against a right handed pitcher the other plays against a left handed pitcher that is a platoon to make it perfectly clear
3440084 thats platooning to me if im not playing every day im platooning if youre an everyday player you play 59 out of 59 unless you cant play call it what you want i call it what i want
3440085 he might think its different we might disagree on that its not a big deal its a matter of thats the way i see it
3440086 to get a deal done detroit will probably have to pick up a chunk of that contract and maybe that will prevent anything from ultimately happening
3440087 the rays in the meantime were contacted by the t ian casselberry
3440088 if sheffield is indeed back to normal the tigers lineup all of a sudde ian casselberry
3440089 yeah we took our pigs out to the airport so they could do a flyover
3440090 while the kindle buzz has stimulated interest in the legal academy the development model will not follow along the lines of kindle
3440091 es que yo no quiero ser solamente tu amigo a
3440092 i heard the dude who owns the place i think his name is jonathon kwanza or something rarely takes a bath
3440093 sammys smoke amp snacks made a great lunch sandwich for me today
3440094 oh yeah ive seen it its got martin luther king jfk and al gore right
3440095 i had a wonderful experience here with a customized massage to focus on my areas of tension
3440096 how do i tell her i like it deeper tissue
3440097 in my opinion this is the perfect spot for brunch lunch
3440098 online purchasing continues to grow much faster than the overall economy
3440099 and the desire for greater selection and choice by consumers will not slow we offer over 2 000 different items including the companys own all day gourmet brand and other leading national brands such as bunn starbucks crystal light and gatorade we are also extremely pleased to have found a team with as much experience and commitment to customer service quality and low prices as those at coffee wholesale usa
3440100 coffee wholesale usa has seen tremendous growth over the past ten years and i am confident that boxwood can successfully build upon what we have started
3440101 it is not often you find a business so well positioned to adopt and capitalize on both mainstream and leading edge technologies
3440102 we are excited to have identified and closed an acquisition that so well exemplifies our goal and mission at boxwood capital partners
3440103 coffee wholesale usa has grown 10 15 annually is profitable competes in a large growing and fragmented market and has a broad base of satisfied customers this is exactly the type of investment we look for
3440104 the construction industry remains soft and a drag on the economy
3440105 but this is not a positive outlook and consequently a net negative 4 percent of all firms seasonally adjusted plan to add to stocks a point better than june but weak
3440106 if the fed is truly through cutting rates this statistic will migrate towards zero or a positive number over the coming months
3440107 apparently owners do not expect the feds easing of interest rates to help
3440108 nei suoi primi 100 giorni berlusconi ha fatto limpossibile mettere ordine in questa nazione apparentemente ingovernabile
3440109 prova di risolutezza soprattutto nella crisi dei rifiuti a napoli e contro la criminalit
3440110 che questa legge potesse rappresentare un conflitto di interessi non passato inosservato sottolinea newsweek ma gli italiani si sentono troppo poveri per prestarvi maggiore attenzione
3440111 gli italiani prosegue larticolo chiedono sicurezza economica e non solo e berlusconi gliela sta fornendo con il suo pugno di ferro in un guanto di velluto emblematica stata la sua abilit nel ripulire napoli per mesi sepolta dalla spazzatura
3440112 were trying to build a project that is good for the community
3440113 whats happening with the permitting process right now whats next and how much longer will all of this take
3440114 so youre closed is there anyway we can get some bread
3440115 we can just take a loaf of that bread on the shelf as i reach for it i swear thats what he said i seriously couldnt understand his accent
3440116 no theres a pillow in the street someone has no pillow to sleep on ha ha ha ill be right back
3440117 campbells select clam chowder microwavable soup bowl and a french roll from their bakery thanks a lot boudins

3440120 smoked salmon scramble with cr me fraiche and tobiko caviar
3440121 well since were at the embarcadero we have 2 choices for food
3440122 we have the food is okay but you totally pay for the view restaurants and we have the food is great but this place is a hole and questionably hygienic restaurant which do you prefer tonight
3440123 i think tonight we could go for a great view and good food
3440124 surreal funny and full to the bite with strong writing and strong acting this production was hands down the best of the bunch
3440125 namina ni juan ang maraming akda ni rene nakababagabag ngunit di nawawalan ng pag asa ang dula ay isang natatanging pagpugay sa minamahal nating guro na ng huling hiling ay pangalagaan ang batang pilipino sinimulan na ni anton juan dagdagan pa natin mga kapatid
3440126 perhaps the staging did not focus enough on basic storytelling compelling and emotive stories suspend ones disbelief by immersing audiences in emotion and involving them in the protagonists travails instead this play relies on technology lavish spectacle and precise artistry to induce hypnosis
3440127 best pie ive had since lombardis in little italy nyc

3440130 stephanie takes over the ferry building one bourgeois boutique at a time
3440131 they have other pastries and baked goods too but their cupcakes are the best
3440132 these empanadas are the best thing here and they taste like theyve been frozen
3440133 those stuffed medjool dates were too soggy for my tastes
3440134 the grilled chicken spanish chorizo was too dry for my liking
3440135 the iaaf is sending a clear message that we will not tolerate doping
3440136 the injury luke suffered is not all that uncommon for golfers and baseball players and im confident he will make a full recovery with the proper rehabilitation and training
3440137 las mujeres normalmente tienen dificultad en realizar los ejercicios adecuados para la zona p lvica y el uso de tacones altos puede ser la soluci n
3440138 como a muchas mujeres a m me gustan los zapatos de tac n alto
3440139 es bueno saber que tienen potenciales beneficios para la salud
3440140 pero para aquellas mujeres que gustan de un tac n ligeramente alto esta investigaci n resulta positiva aunque no se deben descartar la necesidad de realizar ejercicios constantes para mantener saludable esta parte tan importante del cuerpo femenino
3440141 measure n would have turned the unincorporated countys 1 percent growth limit into a voter approved initiative essentially taking decisions on major residential development proposals out of the hands of the napa county board of supervisors and placing them in the hands of voters
3440142 a county consultants report said measure n was so poorly written that it would invite lawsuits from developers and affordable housing advocates essentially costing taxpayers thousands of dollars because the county would be forced to defend any measure approved by voters
3440143 in order to strengthen and restore nevada countys economic freedom and prosperity and to maintain its healthy environment cabpro works for lower fees and taxes less government regulation and preservation of property rights for all residents and business property and resource owners
3440144 giving only scotland a say on independence negates the existence of britain
3440145 worth a look it is however recommended by matthew dancona
3440146 on the internet i keep in touch with opendemocracy a website on global current affairs and its useful offshoot ourkingdom
3440147 at this time i dont know to what capacity i will be used but i know that i will be working with the characters of roman and abe the chief and commissioner of spd and will be shaking things up
3440148 im thrilled to be a part of a giant show like over the years no matter how many other mediums ive worked in ive had a desire to return to daytime tv in that special role i think the mayor of salem is that role
3440149 if taxpayers want more dialog on growth in napa county its going to cost them 250 000
3440150 although a debate over growth is a great idea its not clear that napa county voters need to spend 250 000 to get one
3440151 we support both the normal process of government and the occasional use of referenda to ensure citizens wishes are followed especially on the questions of growth
3440152 rather than spend money to delay the process we recommend voters keep a close eye on their elected supervisors who should heed the voters often expressed opposition to irresponsible growth
3440153 ht has been a godsend for our extremely hyper but lovable portuguese water dog miya

3440418 it should be good its interesting times for english cricket and who knows
3440419 theres a bit of a new era so maybe a score here or a few wickets for tred might do our causes no harm
3440420 i wonder if anyone would notice if i just slipped out the back
3440421 if i can get to the roof maybe i can cut power to the building
3440422 i wonder if a human being is capable of punching himself in the face so hard he looses consciousness
3440423 a leader is best when people barely know he exists when his work is done his aim fulfilled they will say we did it ourselves
3440424 you are misunderstanding this its a side bet and has nothing to do with this game
3440425 contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the injury
3440426 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3440427 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3440428 its international pressure in these last few days from many countries that has now brought this immediate ceasefire thats now shared by georgia and russia
3440429 what we must do now is ensure that its a lasting ceasefire and that there is humanitarian aid which we are prepared to provide for those who are casualties of what has been a terrible set of events
3440430 there must now be talks that will resolve this once and for all
3440431 we cannot continue with the situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to this problem
3440432 what passengers wont tolerate is train companies using the flexibility allowed them by the system to put up some fares by nearly 11
3440433 nor will they tolerate unregulated fares going up by more than this at a time when high fuel prices mean that more people are travelling by train
3440434 que las tetas de ninel conde que su servidor llorar a cuando la pel cula se estrenara y el pudiera evidenciarme frente a todos por postear una foto

3440436 i feel like we have made a lot of improvements on our cars since the last race at michigan
3440437 everything that we are racing now is totally different from where we were with bump stops chassis and all the different things that are on our cars now performance wise we have made big gains
3440438 michigan is one of those places that you need the entire package to compete for the win being successful has a lot do with the horsepower that is under the hood and i think our engine department has stepped up over the past several months as well i look forward to a strong finish this weekend
3440439 i think the maturity of my team has gotten us in the top 12
3440440 we have had a lot of stuff go wrong this year and we are still in the hunt my guys dont sit back and count points and they dont worry about who we are racing as you get closer to the chase you kind of go about your business and do the best you can do add comment
3440441 its too late that wont do you any good here
3440442 it is impossible to tear in here how did you get here
3440443 hurry and throw him into the pit before its to late
3440444 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
3440445 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous
3440446 in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
3440447 this is probably the greatest thing i will ever see in my life
3440448 the conduct was in the defendants scope of employment regardless of whether it was unlawful or contrary to the national security of the united states
3440449 armitage was the original source for a 2003 newspaper column identifying plame as a cia officer at the time her husband was criticizing the bush administrations prewar intelligence on iraq and had become a thorn in the side of the white house rove also discussed plames employment with reporters

3440452 he can bring freshness and a different view as he is someone who had a long and successful playing career
3440453 to be more of a supervisor as many national teams do nowadays
3440454 the players come into this important tie focused on victory
3440455 we have struggled to get here but now we are ready to rewrite the clubs history our goal is to win and give the supporters another reason to celebrate
3440456 they are a technically very strong and while they caused an upset last season in portugal it was well deserved
3440457 we should be warned they are a strong outfit it will be important to be fully focused right from the first minute we have to be compact as i am sure that it will be a tremendously intense match
3440458 all the players want to impress and everybody want to take part in this tremendous task
3440459 i am convinced we are going to qualify for the next stage and the players are ready for it they must enjoy the moment i said the team would be stronger and we have improved since last season
3440460 my ambition has always been to play in my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise said when i told rangers on sunday that i wanted to leave i did so with sadness
3440461 his surprising farewell is a great loss to us and for the bundesliga he was our skipper and has done a lot for the club aside from playing football without marcelinho we would not have reached the uefa cup he has played an outstanding season and played a decisive part in us avoiding relegation the season before
3440462 now that im running for president my lifes just as good as an abba song
3440463 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3440464 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times
3440465 the toilet had been leaking raw sewage into the basement for over a year and id been complaining all year about that
3440466 i would get the promises that they would fix it but they never did
3440467 what were opening up is a huge can of worms and we know it
3440468 were going to a very wealthy industry an industry thats never been regulated before and were saying guess what
3440469 if adopted in the final constitution by the people ecuador would become the first country in the world to codify a new system of environmental protection based on rights
3440470 datadoors for arcgis will give arcgis users the ability to acquire and store on a local machine useful data that will greatly aid them with their gis projects and analysis we are excited about offering this capability to our customers
3440471 i had that same incredible feeling reading this script that i had on capote and here again is an extremely dramatic story about how a torn and twisted life led williams to write such great successes
3440472 la demanda ha sido grande ahorita 12 horas ya no hay entradas de preferencia
3440473 the actions announced today are part of long term global geographic expansion strategy
3440474 investing in the asia pacific region and especially china represents another step in our journey to transform schering plough into a global high performance healthcare company with a long term presence in china schering plough now takes a significant step forward in its strategic development to further build growth and strength in this important market
3440475 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
3440476 theres a real problem that the bigger retailers will be able to spread the risk but at this point independent retailers could be at a disadvantage and it could deliver even less competition over the longer term
3440477 fuelwatch is dead just forget about it its all over
3440478 since petrol prices are driven mainly by global oil prices which will keep trending upwards as we hit peak oil fuelwatch is at best a political distraction from the main game of helping australians reduce our reliance on petrol driven cars
3440479 a very rare survival of a scottish medieval royal tomb
3440480 i was very disappointed in houston because we were ready to help
3440481 it wasnt until two weeks later that the attorneys got a notice the bond fund was available we only had one person who was still being detained and whose family couldnt raise the bail money
3440482 within 24 hours ice decided to take them to the detention centers in texas just to facilitate removing them as fast as possible i thought that was unfair
3440483 if they stayed in massachusetts close to where we could have bonded them out they could have gotten due process
3440484 one of his big themes was that the immigration story in the united states is vital to the health and growth of our country
3440485 i know many many many latin americans including many many mexicans so i have a personal friendship a personal affinity
3440486 these contributors better be prepared to lose a lot of money
3440487 theres one more reason besides humanitarian that this bond fund was created and its just as important its political
3440488 we hope that if we get a lot of history helping people in raids plus a lot of contributions even if its only a buck then we can really have a voice next year in the immigration debate
3440489 we were able to find a family a pro bono lawyer and convince a judge to let us post a 4 000 bond to get him out of jail and into a permanent situation
3440490 when the 4 000 comes back were going to offer that as a scholarship fund for him
3440491 there are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world
3440492 im thinking of buying a smart car and am wondering exactly what the parking rules are
3440493 no pueden personarse como acusaci n popular en el caso del profesor en coma al tratar de evitar una agresi n por violencia de g nero ya que
3440494 parece un juego electoralista y con ello hacen un flaco favor a la familia del agredido y a la credibilidad en las administraciones
3440495 normalizar y legalizar una situaci n que no era correcta en relaci n a las emisiones de tv3 en la comunitat valenciana
3440496 conseguimos que el ministerio de industria diera a la comunitat valenciana un nuevo multiplex de televisi n es decir cuatro canales nuevos de televisi n que se suman a los cuatro que ya tenemos antes
3440497 hemos conseguido que se puedan ofrecer a todo el conjunto de comunidades aut nomas para que se puedan ofertar a canales de comunidades lim trofes
3440498 ped al conseller de catalu a que hicieran un esfuerzo para poder emitir ya canal 9 en este territorio
3440499 podremos normalizar la situaci n y as se podr ver tambi n por la v a de la legalidad que otorga ese nuevo multiplex
3440500 que canal 9 pueda verse en catalu a y en segundo lugar normalizar y legalizar una situaci n que no era la correcta en relaci n a las emisiones de tv3 en la comunitat valenciana
3440501 los juzgados territorializados de violencia sobre la mujer no sean todav a una realidad por la irresponsabilidad ejercida por el psoe en el congreso de los diputados donde los paraliz en el mes de marzo
3440502 cinismo del pspv en materia de violencia sobre la mujer porque lo que deber an hacer sus dirigentes es instar a zapatero a que de una vez por todas cree los juzgados comarcalizados de violencia de g nero
3440503 el gobierno de francisco camps ha insistido en diversas ocasiones que la comunitat necesita una veintena de juzgados especializados en esta materia para prestar a las mujeres v ctimas de violencia de g nero el servicio y la atenci n que necesitan
3440504 sin embargo el ministerio de justicia s lo ha dado su aprobaci n para que la generalitat pusiera en marcha los doce rganos actuales juzgados que sin duda son insuficientes para dar una cobertura especializada a toda la comunitat valenciana
3440505 el gobierno socialista deber a llevar a cabo con premura la modificaci n de la ley de planta y demarcaci n judicial para que al fin se puedan constituir los juzgados comarcalizados
3440506 con ellos adem s de impartir justicia de calidad en materia de violencia de g nero se lograr a agilizar el trabajo de aquellos juzgados de todos los partidos judiciales a excepci n de valencia castell n alicante y elche que compatibilizan este tipo de asuntos con otros ordinarios y que por la racaner a del psoe la mayor a se encuentran saturados
3440507 el pspv en vez de enga ar a los ciudadanos de la comunitat valenciana deber a ser honesto y contar cu nto ha invertido el gobierno socialista en la justicia que lucha contra la violencia sobre la mujer
3440508 es obvio que se callan porque la inversi n ha sido absolutamente nada porque el gobierno de zapatero no acompa la ley integral contra la violencia de g nero con una memoria econ mica en lo referente a la administraci n de justicia
3440509 o es una ignorante o quiere confundir interesadamente a los ciudadanos porque las mujeres que disponen de este tipo de protecci n no han de ingresar en casas de acogida
3440510 if i did have that magic wand in australia i would definitely focus on energy diversity
3440511 i would ask myself do i need to be importing any petroleum at all into this country why would you want to not import petroleum with all the money that flows out of your economy why wouldnt you want to control your own destiny
3440512 our immediate focus is to get this car developed and get it in the market in the united states
3440513 i am envious of australia because i think you are one of the nations that can truly come up with an energy independence strategy and find a way to reduce the automobiles dependence on petroleum
3440514 i would look at lpg as a starting point thats an exciting opportunity because you already have the distribution and the natural gas is relatively inexpensive and relatively clean
3440515 id anticipate compressed natural gas down the road and longer term i would look to hydrogen
3440516 saya sendiri tidak tahu di mana dia zulkifli berada jadi bagaimana pula ada pihak boleh mendakwa kami pkr mengarahkan dia untuk bersembunyi
3440517 mengapa pula kita nak arah beliau berbuat demikian saya sendiri risau dengan kehilangan dia
3440518 rusland is een soeverein buurland binnengevallen en bedreigt een democratisch door het volk gekozen regering
3440519 we zijn vandaag hoger gesloten door beter dan verwachte cijfers over het amerikaans handelstekort en de gestegen dollar
3440520 if we expect private employers to use e verify the federal government should lead by example and not merely by exhortation
3440521 this is just not an effective solution to our immigration problem
3440522 its just another attempt to slap a band aid on a larger problem mandatory verification cannot work without comprehensive immigration reform
3440523 a simple check of are they qualified to work in the united states is not getting you much
3440524 if you really want to be a responsible employer and you want to create a safe work environment then you want to do an employment screening background check which is more comprehensive than simply doing a social security number or i 9 employment eligibility verification
3440525 it is resolving honest mistakes in a way that protects the worker it is also identifying those who are not permitted to work because they are not here legally and thats what it should do
3440526 sen mccain why havent we heard from you on immigration are you avoiding this american issue we are all ears
3440527 will secure the borders first as president but he also believes that we need a comprehensive solution to the issue of illegal immigration
3440528 the u s senates job is to protect and serve the citizens of this country at times it seems as though they have forgotten whence they came
3440529 make no mistake about the fact that the immigration system is beyond broken
3440530 this senate bill was mostly about big money and lobbyists trying to force the issue on elected officials throughout this great country
3440531 just in this county alone the cost to the taxpayers is 1 million
3440532 add to that the cost to the citizens throughout the united states and that taxpayer burden is in the hundreds of millions of dollars
3440533 it motivates me to go back to arizona train harder on my start and turns and then i can come back next time and grab a medal
3440534 they want a place where we can eat somali food and just to be
3440535 after a couple of weeks we get together to eat and talk
3440536 they are nice and they teach me how to do my work
3440537 they need to get more serious sentences than a few months in prison and time served
3440538 to promote respect for the law and as a deterrent
3440539 these prosecutions send a strong message that there is a significant price to pay for those who show no regard for our nations laws or our borders
3440540 this tool is enabling us to take dangerous criminal aliens off the street and out of our communities
3440541 having said that ice prioritizes our resources to focus on those who pose a threat to national security and to our communities at large
3440542 we want to ensure we get the worst of the worst off the streets of our communities
3440543 we are talking about people who are not threats to the american way of life
3440544 theres never been a prosecution or arrest of someone who has crossed our southern border to commit a terrorist act
3440545 whats going on is a change in strategy theres not a change in demography driving it
3440546 they want to create some doubt in defendants minds about coming again and for them to spread the word to friends and neighbors that they might get arrested if they come to the united states illegally
3440547 heres to alcohol the cause of and solution to all of lifes problems
3440548 i dont want to publicize it now and get all the politicians involved with all of their friends who are demonstrators
3440549 i believe the public would rather have officers going after felons than somebody pushing a cart across the street and didnt stop at the crosswalk
3440550 a crime suppression raid where youre targeting individuals by announcing youre coming i dont understand the logic of that
3440551 maybe they will leave town go back to the country they came from and get out of town because they know the sheriff is coming
3440552 i dont think anybody should draw a conclusion on a verbal press release without the actual statistic
3440553 when you look at the jail i run 10 000 inmates 2 000 out of the 10 are illegals thats 20 percent in my jail
3440554 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3440555 a cog in the wheel on an ordinary mission but on this one they get to go ashore and take part in the mission its important to give them ownership of what were doing in this mission by sending them ashore they will benefit from helping others an being involved in the greater mission
3440556 is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3440557 adding fry to the micros portfolio enhances our ability to provide customers with advanced e commerce solutions and technology necessary to operate retail web sites
3440558 while fry has historically targeted the retail segment its broad array of e commerce services are applicable to all of the industries we serve
3440559 the apartment market remains strong and we have the platform to deliver a quality product to meet the growing demand
3440560 we realize consumers these days arent going to have a pocket full of cash we want to move to a cashless cabin
3440561 enter into immediate talks about resolving the investigation as that would be in the best interests of both consumers nationwide as well as wachovia customers
3440562 das mit dem kiosk tut mir aber auch leider aber wie w re es mit einer weiblichen bedienung wenn

3440567 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
3440568 to laugh often and love much to win the respect of intelligent persons and the affection of children to earn the approbation of honest citizens and endure the betrayal of false friends to appreciate beauty to find the best in others to give of ones self to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child a garden patch or a redeemed social condition to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exultation to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded
3440569 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
3440570 a bento lunch is a compact balanced visually appealing meal packed in a box historically its a japanese box lunch similar in concept to the indian tiffin the korean dosirak or the filipino baon lunch in japanese bento or obento refers to the packed meal and bento bako refers to the bento box itself
3440571 my own mother spent countless hours preparing my sister and my lunch boxes when we were in middle school since we were living far away from school she had to get up at the crack of dawn to prepare our lunches and she went all out too our lives were a little bit complicated then and to make up for any time she missed with us she put her heart and soul into those boxes every day to make sure we knew how much we were loved every bite was full of commitment and affection ive never had food with so much spirit as that time period in my life
3440572 when other moms ask me for advice on what to put in the lunch box i was all stoked to create lunch box recipes i tried this whole concept of cooking yet more in a week on top of dinners what i figured out is that the same dinner leftovers i eat for lunch work just great for the kiddo too adding extra cooking work to the workload is kind of setting myself up for failure over the course of the week it does mean making a few extra dishes to make sure we all have lunch and dinner food but its a lot easier to just cook more of something than to cook more somethings
3440573 my six year old goes back to school at the end of this month already school in august is wrong year round preschool on the other hand is a beautiful beautiful thing can i get a witness parents of three year olds so school and all that goes with it like school supplies clothes and ugh lunches ill spend the month of august highlighting simple ways you can green your back to school routine lets start with lunches

3440575 alle die ich in england kenne sind davon berzeugt dass arsenal weiterkommt deshalb liegt auf unseren spielern kein druck
3440576 wir m ssen entspannt in das spiel gehen und an unsere siegchance glauben wir m ssen es aber auch genie en immerhin kommt arsenal es ist die erste teilnahme an der uefa champions league in der geschichte des vereins deshalb ist es eine einmalige gelegenheit f r den klub
3440577 eine gute leistung das ist es was ich sehen will
3440578 man wei nie was passiert wir wollen sicherstellen dass wir in zwei wochen in london noch alle chancen haben
3440579 arsenal will immer in der uefa champions league spielen ich denke dass arsenal sogar in der uefa champions league spielen muss
3440580 wenn man gute spieler und ein gro es stadion hat dann geht man davon aus dass man in europa auf dem h chsten niveau spielen muss
3440581 sie hatten letzte saison ein fantastisches jahr aber sie haben ihre zwei besten spieler verloren karim el ahmadi ist zu feyenoord gegangen und orlando engelaar zu fc schalke 04 das waren ihre spielmacher aber sie haben auch einen guten spieler bekommen n mlich theo janssen von bv vitesse sie werden also in guter form sein und eine gute mannschaft haben
3440582 he must just have wanted to do his own thing for some reason unknown to others
3440583 now she said to kiss her ass shes got more important people to blow off than just you you little nothing
3440584 do i really know how they are doing emotionally today do they need a break a trip are they ready for the next procedure
3440585 the whole web 2 0 explosion has moved from the consumer and college student world to professionals in the business world
3440586 employees are seeing this as a way of enlarging their sphere and interacting with colleagues
3440587 people dont just chat they connect with people and end up talking about things that have an impact on the business
3440588 we knew we had challenges to win the talent war
3440589 we had classes with three students who were on convalescent leave and it was incredibly successful
3440590 it means so much to be able to help so many soldiers and not allow them to fall through the cracks
3440591 now the xbox 360 has triple the space to house all your entertainment needs at no extra cost
3440592 we know consumers need increasingly more and more space to store the amazing digital entertainment content we provide
3440593 its a great honor to be inducted into the ustfccca hall of fame and to be recognized by your peers for your efforts i have been fortunate enough to be around some great athletes
3440594 the potential beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters and the parents but the parents may be disqualified by a conviction or a civil finding of abandonment
3440595 i think its an obscenity i cannot imagine that people in that situation who did what they did to their own daughter are attempting to profit from it
3440596 ne respect m adversarul dar nu ne este team de el vom ncerca s ob inem victoria nu ne va fi u or dar vom ncerca ansele de calificare sunt egale avem un avantaj c ei nu au nc meciuri oficiale n picioare
3440597 meciul va fi la fel de greu chiar dac vor lipsi kewell i karan
3440598 nu ne mul ume te cu nimic faptul c nu vom mai fi arbitra i de bogaciu vina nu este a arbitrilor presiunea este prea mare pentru ei nu trebuia s fie delegat un arbitru din bucure ti la el subcon tientul i a spus cuv ntul la fel a fi procedat i eu dac a arbitra cfr ul este singura echip cu care in de i n tinere e am simpatizat i cu steaua dar m am lecuit
3440599 it is time to start looking after myself and my family
3440600 my departure and seclusion in najaf is my response to all the mistakes we have made in the mahdi army
3440601 we fought for 50 days and in the end iraqi soldiers came and violated the sanctity of our homes
3440602 i will not join those cells even if i am personally asked to do so
3440603 but najaf can wait to fight the occupier with the imam mahdi army is holy work too
3440604 i will have to make do with very little in najaf but thats ok
3440605 but i must find a way to provide for my family
3440606 most americans do not know much about the character of sen barack obama d ill despite nonstop glowing coverage from an adoring media
3440607 barack obama is getting more negative coverage than john mccain on tv network evening news shows
3440608 knowing he had a sure success for the united states the premise of the question he would have instead chosen defeat and humiliation for the united states by surrendering iraq to the terrorists having to choose between what is best for the united states or admitting that he was wrong obama chose his own interests over his countrys best interests a big warning sign
3440609 secondly obama told a group of a sic democrats that
3440610 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to its best traditions
3440611 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3440612 for the ordinary americans who obama thinks just cling to our guns and religion these are some things to consider before we vote
3440613 they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
3440614 as expected inflation continues to move higher however the market will be more interested in tomorrows inflation report which will include the mpcs view on the likely path of inflation over the next couple of years
3440615 there is no question tennessee is a great market for mixed martial arts
3440616 the economic impact will be great we are talking 2 to 3 million gates per major event in nashville and memphis

3440619 i think its time to call for a moratorium on the aerial spread of 1080
3440620 at the end of the day if word of aerial 1080 distribution becomes common talk amongst our clients in north america and europe i think my concession would be worth next to nothing if i dont get any visitors

3440755 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3440756 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3440757 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3440767 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3440768 preliminary results for the month of july and current forecasts for august and september

3440835 we are one party we share one vision and we believe as democrats as independents and repentant republicans in the progress we can make together
3440836 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3440837 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3440838 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3440845 make no mistake statewide and city sales tax increases should all be labeled public employee pension payments tax proponents will never admit this but after the shuffling of funds between spending pots thats what the money is really for
3440846 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3440847 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3440848 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3440849 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3440850 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3440851 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3440852 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3440853 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3440854 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3440855 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3440856 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3440857 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3440858 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3440863 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3440864 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3440865 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3440866 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3440867 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3440868 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3440869 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3440870 who are open to doing something on the production side
3440871 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3440872 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3440873 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3440874 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3440875 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3440876 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3440877 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3440878 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3440879 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3440880 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3440881 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3440882 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3440883 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3440884 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3440885 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3440886 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3440887 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3440888 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3440889 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3440890 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3440891 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3440892 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3440893 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3440894 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3440895 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3440896 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3440897 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3440898 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3440899 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3440900 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3440901 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3440902 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3440903 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3440904 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3440905 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3440906 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3440907 the new diabetic chicago 1994 pg 320 the original receipt called for 8 1 gram packets of aspartame but i found this had too much of an aftertaste also added extra instructions for making good corn starch mixture
3440908 we came back into the market a few weeks ago we are having a look to see how the market reacts to our products and we will see if we will distribute them via a wider network it has been received well so far we think there is a big gap in the unlimited adverse sector at the moment and that is whats slowing the secured market down
3440909 we are delighted to welcome 1st euro to our preferred panel of lenders as we believe them to significantly complement our market leading support service to
3440910 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3440911 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3440912 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3440913 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3440914 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3440915 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3440916 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3440917 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3440918 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3440919 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3440920 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3440921 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3440922 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power

3440928 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3440929 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3440930 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3440931 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3440940 rise up this matter is in your hands we will support you so take courage and do it
3440941 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3440942 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3440943 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3440944 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3440945 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3440946 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3440947 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3440948 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3440954 many experts in foreign policy say that one reason russia responded so forcefully to georgias attempt to take back south ossetia is that the united states and europe had been asserting themselves in russias backyard alienating moscow by supporting kosovos bid for independence
3440955 these expert say that the bush administrations efforts to promote democracy including backing georgian president mikheil saakashvili as a beacon of democracy on russias borders may have emboldened the georgian president to take provocative actions that brought a fierce russian response
3440956 beyond that russia has also been angry about american plans to put a missile defense system in poland and by american moves to encourage georgia and ukraine to join nato
3440957 the combination is that the overall means with which weve dealt with the russians over the last two years have painted them into a corner so that its difficult for them not to see us as hostile said michael greig conflict management specialist at the university of north texas
3440958 is partly to blame for encouraging georgias pro western government to overreach analysts said
3440959 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3440960 simes said u s encouragement of georgian president mikheil saakashvili one of washingtons staunchest allies may have led him to believe he could get away with military action to take back control of south ossetia
3440961 the bush administration has pushed hard for georgia to join nato against european misgivings and russian fury at the idea
3440962 saakashvili was discouraged from attacking russian troops in south ossetia but he clearly never was told point blank

3441030 i happen to disagree with them in regards to our film
3441031 everyone has the right to protest it s a free country anytime that anyone feels that they are justified in their heart more power to them
3441032 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscar
3441033 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards

3441045 there is a suspicion that the former board members put the existence of the bank at risk through expanding business for which the bank was ultimately jointly liable with only limited equity

3441069 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees

3441080 whether youre from malibu or manhattan tacoma or tallahassee no one is immune to identity theft the important thing is that people learn how to deter identity thieves detect suspicious activity on their financial records and defend against the crime should it happen
3441081 we are keen to see the new filmed support material be developed by each nominee as this is the sort of initiative that helps the wider world understand that the creation and development of video games is an art form often with teams of hundreds of people and budgets on a par with feature films
3441082 procedural texturing offers many potential technological and artistic benefits yet the process of translating a precise texture from an artists mind into a procedure is difficult to formulate
3441083 the greatest strength of the allegorithmic technology is that it has made fully procedural texturing a viable alternative to hand painting by means of a visual language appealing to artists as well as engineers
3441084 what is most important to me in my life what are my deepest values and beliefs

3441086 engineers have told us that they need greater performance capability and versatility from a signal source to keep pace with the latest technology

3441088 whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple
3441089 if youre living under your own stress most days chances are there may not be a cross on your shoulder because your shoulders are already weighed down with your own burdens
3441090 if youre living a comfortable life most days chances are there may not be a cross on your shoulder
3441091 the most important is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one 30 and you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength 31 the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these
3441092 its a lot nicer you just throw it all in there baby
3441093 the only thing they got to do is put bottles on the sink thats all they got to remember ya know
3441094 ill always take them outside but sometimes they dont think and just throw it in the trash
3441095 tipping fees for trash in landfills down here are 25 30 per ton while in new york city its like 72 per ton
3441096 the more tonnage you can divert from trash to a recycling program the longer life of your landfills people who dont recycle don t think about that but it will affect their kids and grandkids because instead of a 20 garbage fee they ll be paying 50 because of landfills
3441097 those of us who lived in a war time had to learn to do a lot of things with very little
3441098 we learn about recycling in school and stuff but we just dont think about it
3441099 its just not involved in our everyday life just not a part of everyday places
3441100 this is very important to our economy but against the logic of living on a finite planet
3441101 i try not to be fanatical with recycling it can go overboard
3441102 we do have to use natural resources but i think its not important to waste
3441103 i respect everyone whos for the cause but as far as to judge someone for the amount of energy or paper we recycle i dont want that
3441104 cajuns came down here from canada with nothing so they were very frugal people
3441105 i find im very frugal compared to some of my friends from the city
3441106 if you think about the planet in the matrix people were completely reliant on machines because the planet had been destroyed philosopher henry david thoreau said the true cost of things is measured on how much life we exchange for it
3441107 it causes students to reflect to think that this decision to buy this thing or save that thing comes down to life versus not life and at what point do we start to value whats left of the life of the planet versus economic and technological growth
3441108 as they become more and more aggressive at procuring raw material from the u s itll keep boosting price on these markets
3441109 in terms of what it does for a persons consciousness the longest journey begins with a single step
3441110 recycling is very important as that first step in thinking of what our buying and disposing of impacts the planet

3441138 il presidente del senato renato schifani si legge nel comunicato di palazzo madama in merito alla giovane extracomunitaria fermata nei giorni scorsi dalla polizia municipale di parma e fotografata allinterno di una cella in condizioni di estremo abbandono ha chiesto chiarimenti sullepisodio al prefetto della citt emiliana
3441139 la drammatica foto pubblicata prosegue la nota rischia infatti di trasmettere unimmagine del nostro paese diversa da quella che in realt e di quanto si sta facendo a tutela dellordine pubblico ma nel rispetto dei diritti inviolabili della persona chi intende adottare il criterio della tolleranza zero tenuto a farlo non sottraendosi mai alla tutela della dignit della persona e della sua privacy pertanto il presidente del senato auspica che venga fatta al pi presto opportuna e doverosa chiarezza sullintero accaduto
3441140 parma non ha un sindaco sceriffo e non una citt insensibile nei confronti dei pi deboli
3441141 con quella foto si cercato di attaccare maroni la carta di parma e i sindaci che hanno aderito

3441149 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3441150 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3441151 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3441152 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3441153 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3441154 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3441155 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
3441156 although its more like a one two three four punch
3441157 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
3441158 its going to take the car market by storm at least for the first six months or so
3441159 inflation is likely to touch the 13 14 per cent mark by october but it may soften after that
3441160 we are in constant touch with the rbi on the rebranding issue
3441161 women should not be denied the right to become partners but the billable hour system is not allowing them to advance in their careers and raise a family the 100 hour work week model is just not effective
3441162 today with nearly half of law school graduates women law firms will have to make a fundamental shift in their policies regarding partnership in order to remain competitive we hope that by recognizing the pioneering firms that have already moved the needle a paradigm shift will follow
3441163 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
3441164 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal

3441173 the notes show tojo kept his died in the wool militarist mentality until the very end
3441174 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120 per cent

3441191 from my perspective i dont care whether its a provincial job or a city job
3441192 we have to make sure the citys safe and this incident has made it very clear that we need a review of both the zoning and the provincial regulations
3441193 from my perspective its not adequate to inspect a facility like this every three years
3441194 suppose the operator doesnt operate to the highest standards how are you going to find that out i think that issue needs to be reviewed and our understanding from the province is that is one of the issues they will be reviewing

3441299 about 70 per cent of people coming to the festival come from outside the region with 15 16 per cent being international

3441302 i want to make sure they dont go that way
3441303 the real blow of sureslim closing down was losing the one on one support from the staff you build up a good relationship with them and that is really important when you are trying to lose weight when i lost that it was really difficult
3441304 the golf course theme is there to use international golf course names would be a first for new zealand and that would be a point of difference for taranaki
3441305 the golf names might meet the councils criteria for street names but that doesnt make it right
3441306 the puketapu hapu was asked to suggest some names and they did that with dignity this shouldnt be about people with money it should be about new plymouth district being our place
3441307 the public of taranaki should be very concerned about where we move from here
3441308 i think the reaction will come from the public of taranaki because its taking away the expertise from these committees
3441309 our belief is if we can attract them to taranaki where they generally have a good time a reasonable percentage will return

3441319 it is with great sadness that we must begin this wind down of our business irish consumers are the real losers as the market will be restored to a virtual monopoly while we brought competition to the market and fought hard to keep it alive the current risk equalisation scheme makes it impossible for us to have a viable health insurance business
3441320 it is a failure by the government to strike a balance between the issues of community rating risk equalisation and competition in a way which delivers to the irish people
3441321 but you need to operate at a loss and subsidise the state agency who is your main competitor
3441322 you need to operate at a loss and subsidise the state agency who is your main competitor
3441323 ireland is part of the eu and that we have a right to competition in the market ye have decided that a competitor must pay the dominant player in the market for the right to exist in the market this eminds of the gerrymandering whcih took place in northern ireland from the 1920s to the late 1960s and we all know what has happened there over the last 30 years i wabt choice not a monopoly if i want that i can buy the board game

3441328 la uia no tiene un n mero no somos medidores de inflaci n lo que se trat en el comit ejecutivo es precisamente la elaboraci n de un documento si 24 personas se ponen de acuerdo con una determinada forma de conducirse esa forma hay que respetarla nada m s

3441364 as millions of americans dig deeper into their pockets to make ends meet i cannot in good conscience take more money out of their pockets for my own healthcare until an affordable healthcare plan that covers everyone is created
3441365 members of congress need to start living like the rest of us and pay their own way
3441366 with an affordable system of coverage we can give health care to the 25 million underinsured and 47 million uninsured americans and reduce the burden placed on property taxpayers seniors and our families if we want to change washington we need to start by changing the type of people we send there

3441421 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3441422 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3441423 market conditions have become more challenging particularly in the u s
3441424 the american economy is slowing other hoteliers like the marriott international hotels have been downgraded for the rest of the year because of that so the warning has had no negative effect on the shares
3441425 but the shares are up because the hotels continue to grow intercontinental is managing to sign new rooms which is the companys main driver of growth as it operates with a franchised model
3441426 the firms earnings have come as a relief from recent bad news in the hotel industry

3441433 well never get reform in albany if we dont send reformers there and daniel squadrons independent voice is exactly what new york city needs in our state capitol
3441434 as mayor i have made turning around the citys schools and investing in our infrastructure among my top priorities because its hopeless to build for our future without either by helping move hundreds of millions of dollars out of our school bureaucracies and into city classrooms and by helping us raise nearly three billion dollars for transit infrastructure daniel squadrons record getting things done for new yorkers is already more impressive than many lifelong legislators daniel squadron is independent hard working and smart three things i always look for when i go into the voting booth i am proud to endorse daniel squadron for state senate and strongly encourage democrats in lower manhattan and brooklyn to vote for him in september
3441435 mayor bloomberg and i share a belief in taking on big challenges and fighting for what we believe is right and we both know that there is no bigger challenge than reforming albany nor any fight that could be more right
3441436 i am honored that the mayor is supporting this race for reform and results i continue to believe that with hard work independence and a progressive vision our state legislature has incredible potential to deliver real results for our neighborhoods our city and our state

3441462 what derby is experiencing is not out of kilter with what is happening nationally
3441463 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3441464 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3441465 i think due to the weather conditions as well the hot and humid weather and the rains as for the previous olympic games the first couple of days there were not many spectators that show up
3441466 as from today we will get more spectators into the stadium
3441467 there are too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers to sit in them but if people will come over for these empty seats then they will stand up and go and let the ticket holders have their seats

3441472 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
3441473 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
3441474 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
3441475 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
3441476 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
3441477 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
3441478 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
3441479 this translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes perhaps due to stronger than normal connections says saenz who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes

3441491 ele vai tentar por assim dizer colocar a administra o do governo sob a tutela do parlamento

3441493 uma vez que o descontentamento t o grande no que diz respeito economia que ali larijani pode contar com o apoio dos deputados conservadores cr ticos com a sustenta o t tica dos partid rios do antigo presidente rafsandjani e com a neutralidade ben vola ao menos por enquanto dos reformadores

3441501 failure to implement new zealands cancer control strategy according to agreed timelines will cost new zealand many deaths from preventable cancer
3441502 what is the point of detecting cancer if we dont have the people equipment and medicines to treat it
3441503 this is going to stick and it has another us10c fall in it by late 2009
3441504 it is strange times when you are celebrating the currency back to us70c and oil under us115 a barrel
3441505 some financial assistance from the nzru wouldnt go astray given we are in the situation where we may need some assistance
3441506 we will do everything we can to make sure of this
3441507 from our point of view as the crusaders it would be completely unacceptable to be hamstrung by just having one province
3441508 thats exactly the problem if we dont have something clarified soon that is the risk
3441509 people do not understand and if we cant get understanding we are going to have to try to sort things out
3441510 we are a significant lobby group and if we take a position on something that we feel strongly about they will have to listen and if they dont listen there will be trouble
3441511 we are concerned these transactions have all the hallmarks of a kneejerk response
3441512 it is pretty disturbing when you see civilian buildings destroyed
3441513 there was a very loud bang and then you start thinking that must have been a bomb because we are actually at war
3441514 first you feel shock then disbelief you cant really believe that a bomb has just been dropped close to where you are living and then you wait and see if theres a second bomb
3441515 i feel safe here in tbilisi but if it gets worse we will think about evacuating pretty smartly
3441516 the plan is to stay here until we consider the situation dangerous enough that we should really get out
3441517 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3441518 i dont want to leave i do consider georgia my home
3441519 this was last minute a choice we had to make we had been through several inspections they were all very strict
3441520 when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
3441521 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless in each member of our teams view
3441522 its a lot faster but there are times when you can control the pace of the game without just tapping the ball when its not really on from free kicks
3441523 when the new rules came in everyone was nuts over getting the ball and tapping it halfbacks were digging in getting it out and running even though the defensive line was set and then they were just turning it over
3441524 you are actually just putting yourself under the hammer there are times during the game where you have to stop and say hey we do have to slow it down a bit and thats when you just have to kick it out
3441525 we definitely should have kicked it out instead of running in the end we ran out of steam
3441526 from a fullbacks perspective its changed immensely not being able to kick out from the 22 you have to really make sure you are on the job there as to whether you return the kick or run it
3441527 right across the board you have to be more aware of it kicking when you are playing the kicking game its a lot easier from set piece but its when its returned that things get a bit complicated
3441528 there is a lot more emphasis at training on learning to kick into space under the old laws wings just chased or ran

3441535 does long island s overtime loss to hudson valley in the final game after you had clinched the gold medal tarnish the gold
3441536 i don t think so no not at all we had 19 minutes of penalties and i m kind of wondering how that happened the goal was gold and we won the gold i m happy and the kids are happy
3441537 those li coaches were going bonkers on the sideline li kids were crying laying on the ground afterwards
3441538 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3441539 all the things they listed in that judgment have not changed
3441540 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

3441558 we were down myles against greeley and were down shane when we played suffern when we are all together and we are all healthy its a good scenario for us i am not saying those games would have been different but its always good to best to have your top scorers
3441559 ok they are not nearly as good as us lets blow em out and coast

3441563 john jays big win marks new era in rivalry against yorktown
3441564 i have been working really hard with the titans and i did not give the mll much thought because i was so involved with the indoor league
3441565 two teammates from delaware jordan hall and dan deckelbaum mentioned my name to the chicago program because they were looking for defensemen so they called me last week and told me they wanted to take me with the first pick i always wanted to play in the mll and am very excited to start this spring

3441569 b schools is minimal and just becaue a kid played in
3441570 ultimately the answers were unclear as to how good john jay is right now
3441571 the score was even at 1 1 after the first quarter thanks to nyack goalie sebastien fontanges who made six excellent saves in the opening quarter nyack took over in the second quarter scoring four times including twice in a seven second span drew lydecker and kevin mccabe scored seven seconds apart at 2 41 and 2 48 followed by lydecker at 4 30 and mccabe at 5 18 devin delucia opened the third with a goal for nyack after souths john buechli and lydecker traded goals souths james devine scored twice and assisted on sean days goal closing the vikings to within 7 5 brennan slattery and lydecker halted the south run on a goal with 50 seconds remaining in the third quarter drew lydecker finished with a hat trick and two assists and mccabe added two goals and an assist the story of the game was fontanges who finished with 24 saves
3441572 it was good this time playing with danny as our goalie instead of trying to score against him
3441573 we were in the exact same locker room as we were against south side and i was even in the same spot
3441574 its the only time you get on the field but you know how important it is so you try to get the other guys fired up
3441575 when he decided to transfer from denison there was a different coach john danowski who is now at duke
3441576 so when the coaching change happened he didnt know what his role would be but hes been unbelievable
3441577 a little of both i dont think even michael was happy with the way he was playing
3441578 well rememember that loss for the rest of our lives
3441579 they were choosing between me and another empire state games goalie
3441580 they didnt tell me who it was or what region he was from but they said if i didnt not commit theyd go with the other goalie
3441581 they were looking for a goalie who could start for four years
3441582 they basically told me theres a real good chance i could be starting for four years

3441589 dorsey is a hero and a legend i traveled from savannah to be here for this event and to lend the support of our brothers and sisters to the condemnation of texas whites
3441590 yes though you have given us the very sun to use against them today on the cusp of this murder we ask you for more now too give us the air and the water give us the grass and the shade increase the weight in the color of our skin so that the devil can not bare to be in our very presence yeah let our very words hold the breathe of their lives

3441597 he has to just sit there with his stick out like he doesnt have a ball so hes kind of hiding it kind of nonchalant just walks it right in and dumps it with 4 40 left

3441675 its full of blackberry currant and cedar flavors and has very firm tannins its great now but will drink even better after its been cellared for a couple of years
3441676 we have access to tremendous cabernet fruit and we looked at this as a real opportunity to make a single varietal marketing statement
3441677 i wanted the strong graphic shape of the tape to contrast the reserved classic typography on the label much like b side releases often contrasted the mainstream a side songs though it originally was intended to be a cassette tape i like to think of it more as the image of recording tape in a studio where the musicians actually laid down their b side tracks

3441710 no one would even have thought of rye as a state championship contender prior to yesterday
3441711 lacrosse is growing very quickly here and players coaches and parents cant get enough information
3441712 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3441713 i was certainly encouraged to hear the speaker last night suggest a willingness to allow the house to have an up or down vote on the merits of unlocking the potential of americas abundant energy resources but the proof will be in the proverbial pudding
3441714 republicans have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3441715 we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3441716 ive had my eye on a number of retail stocks for some time now looking for signs of a potential turnaround and starbucks is now high on my list
3441717 one of the main reasons for the slide in sbux shares from its high of 40 in november 2006 was the overly aggressive expansion plan
3441718 and as food and dairy prices have soared this has led to higher operating costs in turn this forced starbucks to raise prices just as consumers were struggling from the housing slump and soaring inflation
3441719 and as competition from the likes of mcdonalds and dunkin donuts has turned up the heat starbucks has suffered charges related to closing out unprofitable stores but starbucks is tackling the problems
3441720 declining sales along with its falling stock price have hit starbucks like a double shot of espresso at 7 00 am so the firm has gone back to basics launching its revival from the top
3441721 starbucks has re hired the man responsible for the companys success ceo howard schultz having served as ceo from 1987 to 2000 schultz helped starbucks grow from 100 coffee shops to 15 756 stores today
3441722 his knowledge and experience should help greatly in turning starbucks around he wants to return to the companys roots the coffee the consumer and the starbucks experience more specifically schultz plans to reform starbucks in the following ways
3441723 i like what i hear about starbucks transformation but in the current environment the key to boosting business is pricing people are willing to pay for the starbucks experience as long as the price is within reason
3441724 schultzs strategy of soft pedaling growth in mature markets while investing more heavily overseas reminds me of the mcdonalds plan in the early 2000s it worked too its share price has more than quadrupled since 2003
3441725 and schultzs return has attracted some much bigger customers too
3441726 typically he pressures companies to focus on their core businesses and dump less profitable ventures he will reinforce starbucks raison detre a coffee house do coffee and do it well and people will return
3441727 the return of schultz and his rebuilding plan along with investments by peltz and ainslie has had a positive effect on sbux shares over the last month
3441728 down from its november 2006 all time high of 40 a definitive close above 18 52 would now indicate a positive change in trend
3441729 i saw cecere on the sidelines during the pr game
3441730 pac say 8 6 also btw both teams recently played byram mahopac won by a goal and pv lost by three goals
3441731 it does not matter how you pour the coffee the cream always rises to the top
3441732 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
3441733 were disappointed anytime that someone is unable to worship freely
3441734 so lance when are you going to quit making excuses and work on that lapsed license
3441735 i had to follow that road right into leonard wow that was scary actually
3441736 but yeah i really miss flying i was at valley fair and on those high rides and it was like flying yeah i definitely gotta get back to it i just need you to keep needling me
3441737 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
3441738 this ones a reference for the colour palette but dont look at the models theyre not right for the models you need to look at this other piece of reference but dont look at the lighting on that one for the lighting we have this other shot
3441739 con la salida de ruud creemos que es el momento justo para hacer m s cambios radicales dentro de la organizaci n

3441741 esta decisi n fue la correcta para la organizaci n la m s adecuada para los jugadores y para nuestros seguidores
3441742 agradecemos a alexi por el tremendo trabajo y dedicaci n que realiz en su trabajo diariamente
3441743 francamente se ha vuelto m s dif cil de lo que hab a anticipado para mi familia el acomodarse a la zona y el club ha mostrado un gran apoyo y comprensi n con mi decisi n
3441744 oh this team beat this team who beat that team
3441745 to submerge our culture and religious heritage under a flood of cannibalism voodooism and beastly jungle sex orgies
3441746 who slipped in among the jewish people in jerusalem and claim to be gods chosen people when in fact they are of lucifer
3441747 in 1967 jerusalem fell to the kenites during the 6 day war
3441748 the kenites who are responsible for the slaying of christ
3441749 this is certainly identity theology inasmuch as he presents a two seedline argument identifies the present inhabitants of israel with the descendants of cain and calls the mating of the serpent with eve the primal sin
3441750 what about teaching serpent seed i make no apology for teaching the word of god
3441751 bless your heart if you have ever been deceived by the kenite and i am speaking now on the spiritual level if you have ever really believed that group was the chosen of god you were deceived by satan
3441752 repent of that even more so than your personal sins in the personal sense
3441753 anyone saying that i use the word kenites to describe judah is not telling the truth
3441754 why do you think their own talmud is the filthiest piece of literature ever written because theyre at home with it they love it its their cup of tea its satans cup of tea
3441755 murray is a bit distinctive in one respect and that is the emphasis on kenites
3441756 none of the central figures in the formation of christian identity speak of the kenites
3441757 hell say he loves the jews its the kenites he doesnt like
3441758 by 1996 i owned and had studied every single subject cassette available at the time
3441759 lets get one thing straight coming out the gate are you saying we should hate judah that would be stupid indeed
3441760 the angels will take care of the tares the tares are taken together in the fire thats the end of the world thats how its going to be
3441761 to say i teach racism or practice racism is another outright lie we have people of all races that attend and study with the shepherds chapel
3441762 yep murray is lukewarm he is half right which makes him all dangerous
3441763 ive been studying with the chapel for about 15 years
3441764 murray believes that blacks are exactly the same as whites in the eyes of god
3441765 god created different races and thats the way he wanted us to stay
3441766 was to destroy those of different races who had intermixed
3441767 id like to see them crawling around the floor picking up their blood money
3441768 if i had a health problem like asthma and i were looking for things to prevent aggravating my respiratory problems candles and incense are two things i would seriously consider getting rid of
3441769 hice mi mejor esfuerzo desgraciadamente no alcanz para ganar hablar con mi padre para ver qu planes tenemos si existen las condiciones para seguir otro ciclo ol mpico o si tengo que debutar como profesional

3441772 oscar es un jovencito que tiene solamente tres peleas internacionales es un gran prospecto hoy lo hizo bien y esperamos que m s adelante tenga la oportunidad de mostrarle a la gente lo buen boxeador que es as como lo hizo ahora
3441773 el boxeo es as un d a tienes la oportunidad de ganar al otro no pero vamos a hacer siempre nuestro mejor esfuerzo por triunfar

3441779 esperaba un apoyo incondicional de occidente y occidente le hab a dado motivos para pensarlo
3441780 lo que ocurri en la noche del 7 de agosto est m s all de la comprensi n
3441781 los militares georgianos atacaron la capital de osetia del sur de tskhinvali con lanzacohetes destinados a devastar grandes zonas y rusia tuvo que responder
3441782 por eso le acusan a rusia de agresi n a los pobres e indefensos georgianos pero eso no solo es hip crita sino que muestra una falta de humanidad
3441783 con el apoyo de una fuerza mucho m s poderosa
3441784 han sido entrenadas por instructores estadounidenses y su sofisticado equipo militar fue comprado en otros pa ses
3441785 esto junto con la promesa de ingreso en la otan envalenton a los dirigentes georgianos en su idea de que puedan vencer en una guerra rel mpago en osetia del sur
3441786 es de sentido com n reconocer que rusia est arraigada all por la geograf a com n y siglos de historia
3441787 rusia no busca la expansi n territorial pero tiene intereses leg timos en esta regi n
3441788 result ser una bomba de relojer a para la integridad territorial de georgia
3441789 cada vez que los sucesivos dirigentes georgianos han tratado de imponer su voluntad por la fuerza tanto en osetia del sur y en abjasia donde las cuestiones de autonom a son similares solo han hecho que la situaci n empeore
3441790 es un proceso largo que requiere paciencia y di logo
3441791 algunas naciones occidentales han tomado posiciones sobre todo en el consejo de seguridad de la onu que han estado lejos de ser equilibrada
3441792 el consejo de seguridad no fue capaz de actuar con eficacia desde el comienzo del conflicto
3441793 las naciones de fuera de la regi n quiz s podr an ayudar pero solo si toman un juicio justo y una postura objetiva
3441794 wave of misgovernment has been brought to you by an ideology not incompetence
3441795 is there such a thing as good and bad clients or is that just a myth
3441796 sorry about that i spent about 11 years with ddb vancouver and tribal ddb san francisco in mid 06 i went client side to run marketing for an online retailer and since last december ive been doing freelance work and trying to find a new agency gig to no avail so far vancouver is a bit of a secondary market unfortunately
3441797 new and not particularly useful but it blows me away
3441798 this showed how well online work could really be done
3441799 im a north american child of the 80s this is the reason why i got into advertising in the first place this is where i learned about the emotional impact that advertising could have and this is where i learned that the business didnt just sell stuff it creates culture and has an impact on society
3441800 trying to work out my top 3 ads ever is a tricky one and i reckon if you asked me again next week id say something different
3441801 a guy in a wheelchair waits at a set of traffic lights if a driver pulled up and wasnt wearing a seatbelt then the wheelchair guy went over and tapped on their window hed then hand them a leaflet saying something like i didnt wear a seatbelt either kind of effective
3441802 good for staying down with the kids and new stuff
3441803 a useful and informative place for the disenfranchised man city supporter
3441804 sounds a bit full on but its a fantastic book of lino cuts and prints
3441805 this is the nation of georgia and you all europeans see that we dont surrender if you want to learn something about freedom come to georgia long live georgia
3441806 all the seedings and brackets will be determined next thursday
3441807 i want to say that you are allowed to move up for regular season play but not for sectionals
3441808 the defense also held niskuyuna this year to 9 same as yorktown
3441809 im still a yorktown fan every other day of the year
3441810 average daily rate growth is going to slow though it wont be cut drastically and thats where the buyer can come in and negotiate
3441811 its going to be more competitive so there may be more bargaining power on the corporate side
3441812 hotels have been doing extremely well but when there are more offerings hotels have to start negotiating rates and going after markets that they didnt before
3441813 given the deterioration of the dollar against the euro america is pretty much on sale
3441814 san francisco used to rely on the technology industry and when there was the crash hotel business suffered in new york finance advertising media and tourism all are big components so its a market that does not suffer as much when there is a recession it turns around much faster than any others
3441815 construction costs are on the rise and financing rates are much higher and thats if you are lucky to get it
3441816 some of these planned hotels will find the financing to make the project happen but some will not so we may have less supply then whats originally indicated
3441817 were talking about occupancy decreasing thats at very high levels
3441818 it probably will bottom out at about 80 percent which is still very strong
3441819 this is good for gdp but it makes our economy more reliant than ever on growth of sales overseas had it not been for exports our economy would have been negative
3441820 other power league teams which is that im sure the great coaches of town and jj will not be taking the other power league teams for granted
3441821 while most americans were struggling the good times were rolling among the top 10 percent
3441822 charest le qu teux qui doit continuellement qu ter sa pitance dottawa
3441823 we used to say that osteoarthritis came from wear and tear thats now revised to say that is can result from tear but not wear

3441825 during overtime i couldnt help but get reminded of the huntington john jay state semifinal game last year won by huntington 11 10 in double overtime the overtimes of this game and that one were remarkably similar
3441826 in the fight against cancer were all on the same team
3441827 we are delighted to have laura join our marketing team

3441831 we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3441832 every epoch suffers from the disability of being contemporaneous with itself and of having no idea where it might lead
3441833 of form and content become entirely one because the poems language somehow incarnates its meaning whereas language points to things poetic language actually embodies them there is a theology lurking behind this poetics just as the word of god is the father made flesh so the poem does not simply talk about things but in some mysterious way becomes them
3441834 only when words cease to be themselves and merge into their referents can they be truly expressive
3441835 it is as if in the midst of a lively conversation between two friends a maid suddenly appeared to tell the host that a salesman was at the door in the second place i refuse the positions i have taken in the main narrative believing likewise that it is improper of me to dispute things with my visitor in this case the reader in the sala i have thought it best to argue in the backroom in the notes at the end of this book
3441836 what appears in a psychological explanation as fictive threats from within the self turn out to have social and material form the ilustrado ideal of domestic comfort and ease which agoncillo tries to realize in and as scholarly write is potentially disrupted by rude concerns of commerce and petty enterprises represented by the intrusive salesman the narrative which secures the ilustrado subjecthood is conceived as a civilized sala conversation between two friends which mundane economic concerns as well as politically tendentious arguments must be excluded and relegated to the backroom the notes at the end of the book
3441837 psychology is the logic of attachments and sympathetic action which serves as the very methodology of agoncillos history it is not just that agoncillo is prejudiced by prior regional gender and class identification
3441838 the only explanation i have for this conclusion is that the author being based in the university of adelaide had to make his bow in the direction of global capitalism as he also benefits from it the university after all is famous for its ties with corporations and the australian defense industry
3441839 should be analyzed of its process and conditions out of the available discourses ideology masquerading as coherence and plenitude is in reality inconsistent
3441840 limited contradictory and the realist text as a crystallization of ideology participates in this incompleteness even while it diverts attention from the fact in the apparent plenitude of narrative closure it is the mode of production the materials and then the arrangement is the work
3441841 becomes plural open to re reading no longer an object for passive consumption but an object of work by the reader to produce meaning
3441842 belgian writer and journalist who has written extensively on the geo political aims of natos war against yugoslavia and author of two books on the balkans liars poker and monopoly the question should be
3441843 it is political and violates international law it involves a dangerous precedent for all that bush and company are preparing
3441844 tribunal that has no legal basis largely funded from not disinterested private finance soros rockefeller time warner that refuses to try the crimes committed in ex yugoslavia by washington prot g s not to mention natos own crimes
3441845 supreme court of belgrade had declared the extradition of milosevic illegal but the flemish government or that of brussels carried out the extradition nonetheless everyone knows that the djnidjic government carried out their transfer in exchange for a reward that the united states didnt even pay him
3441846 in 1980 the international court of justice condemned president reagan for having mined the ports of nicaragua with the goal of destabilizing the leftist sandinista government there the us stopped recognizing the court
3441847 it is out of the question that any us citizen can be charged for crimes he may have committed and the us marines would go and rescue him by force no matter where in the world the trial would be taking place
3441848 the masters of the world claim that they are judging milosevic but refuse to judge chiles general augusto pinochet or israels ariel sharon the latter can illegally occupy palestine practice apartheid ethnic cleansing by steps and terror yet he continues to receive billions and billions of dollars and euros and europe doesnt raise its little finger
3441849 milosevic has been attacked not for crimes he might have committed but because he resisted the imf and the multinationals that wanted to control his country the most important dimension of this trial is bush is threatening more and more countries that are rebellious north korea iraq even iran guerillas in colombia philippines underscoring mine and tomorrow still others the goal of this trial is to intimidate all the other third world leaders who follow a course of resistance to multinationals it is a trial of intimidation
3441850 1989 when he tended to introduc e capitalism to yugoslavia all the while hoping to control it
3441851 the colossal price hikes homes deprived of electricity massive loss of jobs
3441852 having utilized islamic terrorists from bin ladens movement to break up yugoslavia and to divide the peoples in bosnia in kosovo and in macedonia even
3441853 clinton blair german chancellor helmut kohl and the us and german secret services for their clandestine work in yugoslavia
3441854 it is as if sharon is judging palestinian premier yassir arafat
3441855 to grant muslims significant governing autonomy and the right to live under shariah law in an expanded area of the archipelagos southern island
3441856 removing muslims from the rest of philippine society and enabling them to shape an entirely separatist mentality that dreams of carving out a pan islamic state from other existing countries in the region such as malaysia indonesia and singapore
3441857 john jay is still better than rye so shut up
3441858 they will beat any team in section one at any sport
3441859 scoreboard scoreboard scoreboard scoreboard scoreboard thats all i got to say 9 8 9 8 9 8 rye is number one and yorktown do what rye did and then we will talk
3441860 the score of the iona hackley game was 23 2 at half the starters only played half of the game
3441861 it is time to start looking after myself and my family
3441862 my departure and seclusion in najaf is my response to all the mistakes we have made in the mahdi army
3441863 we fought for 50 days and in the end iraqi soldiers came and violated the sanctity of our homes
3441864 i will not join those cells even if i am personally asked to do so
3441865 but najaf can wait to fight the occupier with the imam mahdi army is holy work too
3441866 i will have to make do with very little in najaf but thats ok
3441867 but i must find a way to provide for my family
3441868 the high export number is the standout and its one that if it continues implies a higher rate of gdp growth for the u s economy in q2 but lets not jump the gun economists sense theres a global economic slowing going on exports may have peaked as a result so this large increase in june may prove to be transitory
3441869 exports are the only engine of growth right now but we still have tremendous contraction forces in housing and in declining disposable income i expect upward negative revision in those categories so the total q2 gdp revision will be modest in my interpretation
3441870 vi m ste bli b ttre p att kanalisera diskussioner internt
3441871 mas estes s o assuntos mundanos desinteressantes volto a perguntar como est passando meu amigo
3441872 um sax bar tono entrando dentro dos ouvidos e dos sentimentos como l ndea invis vel gerando coceiras as quais n o h rem dio ou creolina capaz de aplacar o inc modo mas qual o qu bobagem cheia besteira de mais para tanta conversa que poderia ser coment rios rss
3441873 no regrets no regrets at all yeah disney offered me the role but its not really what i see for myself
3441874 im relieved and happy to win but really bothered by all the breakdowns we had in the fourth
3441875 yorktown and john jay cheap title to get lots of blog hits
3441876 boys lacrosse in the lower hudson valley with joe lombardi
3441877 well we didnt beat you 20 1 because our fifth string goalie got to play
3441878 could i help it if when i fired you were holding that pistol in front of your heart
3441879 dont matter to me the only thing that matters is jesus christ
3441880 he set his seal of ownership on us and put his spirit in our hearts as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come
3441881 first brendan kurpis one goal three assists took a feed from john froats and converted a sharp angle goal from just outside the crease to tie the score at 9 9 with 1 16 left then after a faceoff win yorktown held for a final shot ranagan a lefthanded midfielder took a long pass from kurpis and began sprinting to his right and took an off handed bounce shot that went in with 16 seconds lefts
3441882 a lot would have to go right for rye to pull off what would be one of the biggest upsets in section 1 in the last few years do the garnets have a chance absolutely but i am predicting john jay to win 10 5
3441883 jay is on another level and we will see for sure tomorrow or i will swallow my sword
3441884 but to even have a remote chance in that type of game brewster would need to play significantly better than it did against greeley to have any chance
3441885 he said hey your rookie year is tough its the toughest year you have you have to make an adjustment to everything not only the game but the playbook and the whole deal the only thing you can do is take it one day at a time that
3441886 thats what im trying to focus on doing just one play at a time earn the peoples respect and make plays when you get a chance
3441887 jacob did a lot of things wed seen him do in college things we expected him to do and things hed been doing in practice
3441888 he got an opportunity to catch the ball and he felt comfortable out there for the first time
3441889 he showed what hes capable of doing in the passing game
3441890 it was fun it was a blast getting a chance to make some plays out there thats all you can hope for to get down near the end zone all you can hope for is the ball coming your way
3441891 jared obviously threw some great balls right on the money so that was part of it
3441892 jared and i both played at kentucky but we never really played together so it wasnt like we had a big time chemistry
3441893 maybe we do now after that game no matter who the quarterback is you have to be ready to get open thats all im trying to do
3441894 we use the tight end a lot of different ways in this offense in all sorts of different positions
3441895 im just trying to do my best to show i can fill one of those roles and step in
3441896 theres still little stuff i have to keep working on i have to keep getting into the playbook but for the most part im feeling good about knowing whats going on out there its a process
3441897 i have to finish up these five days and keep getting better with that
3441898 we tight ends do so many different spots in this offense
3441899 you have to know the technique at each spot so its getting better and better
3441900 this is a little more complex than college as a tight end the complexity of it comes from all the different positions on the field i keep saying it but its a huge difference at kentucky youre lining up at tight end 90 percent of the time and slot a few times
3441901 here you line up at tight end some of the time in the slot some of the time and youre in the backfield some too you put yourself in the backfield the whole game changes you have to know everything
3441902 all of those parts make it a little more complex but its coming along pretty good
3441903 she belongs to one of hollywoods most powerful television dynasties but during a trip to shops and a playground with her infant son liam over the weekend actress tori spellings appearance left observers worried for her health
3441904 all division a teams qualify for sectionals regardless of record
3441905 internal culture war and self hatred in the west allow islamic inroads
3441906 islams victims deserve better than false preaching islam is a religion of peace
3441907 sunni muslim 70 in north christian 5 mostly in south and khartoum indigenous beliefs 25
3441908 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
3441909 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
3441910 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
3441911 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
3441912 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
3441913 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
3441914 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
3441915 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
3441916 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
3441917 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
3441918 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
3441919 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
3441920 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun
3441921 twitter has a surprising profile its very strong within the states where it has any presence but is basically dead outside of it
3441922 they have a bunch of seniors that ive been playing against my whole life that play well together and they definitely wanted to win but im pretty happy they didnt
3441923 we talked about it being a game of runs and im so proud they didnt get discouraged and let it become an insurmountable lead
3441924 the goal in this section is to be up there with the yorktowns and the john jays and i feel like were up at that level
3441925 they won it last year so we want that back bad real bad
3441926 were going to do everything we can to get that back
3441927 the sound of helms precise yet bluesy steel guitar on williams recordings helped usher in a honky tonk sound that would define country music for years to come
3441928 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3441929 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3441930 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3441931 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3441932 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3441933 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3441934 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3441935 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3441936 hey we wont ride your clear just stand still for 20 seconds while we get our 4th pole and d middies on and you can run your o middies on and then we will get the game started again
3441937 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
3441938 you must be the change you wish to see in this world
3441939 kita perlu melahirkan pengetahuan yang hilang itu kembali dan menanamkannya ke dalam tubuh pribadi dan tubuh masyarakat kita untuk menjadi

3441941 the worlds first netlabel devoted to children we are making history together the netlabel features music for kids by kids and by cool grownups as well as audio stories videos printable books and
3441942 hes an absolute beast hes a little unorthodox the way he plays but hes a great player
3441943 i really thought faceoffs were key in this game considering the way they controlled them at the end of the last game a 10 9 yorktown win in the murphy cup
3441944 we got outhustled out groundballed and outplayed we didnt get off the bus we started panicking as they kept scoring
3441945 elite nationally recognized team during the season you must except the a high burden of
3441946 the kentucky what who cares this is the murphy cup
3441947 well since the yankees are out ill root for the american league
3441948 please jay fans do not wax poetic about this being a huge win duxbury beat brewster only 13 9 and lost to nisky 12 7 for crying out loud they have not one good win this season how they are ranked 15th in the country or were ranked 15th is a crime total joke
3441949 oh i respect all the teams and its great that they win because i live 20 miles away from there and were part of the same team
3441950 this case is not about who is right and who is wrong in terms of the property dispute it comes down to that one issue
3441951 he wanted the use the next door property as his own and that motivated him to lie fabricate and mislead
3441952 we left both cats here and while milly was inside when we left we didnt manage to get maddy inside
3441953 milly keeps meowing at the door for her and she has lost a lot of weight since maddy left its just awful
3441954 they dont normally talk much but thats all shes done since thursday
3441955 and the kids just love her to pieces its very sad
3441956 the whole neighbourhood knows her and i have asked all around as to where she may have gone
3441957 its probably a bit early for me to predict a date for work to start but we would be hoping for it to start in the first part of 2009
3441958 the ambience of the residential area could change forever and that is such a shame
3441959 apparently town came out flat and let in a few real bad goals tonite
3441960 i think it probably would have made more sense last year when john jay was clearly far and above everyone else in the section this year though i dont know if thats the case
3441961 rye is a very good team league c team but remember the jj and yorktowns of the world are in a different league
3441962 security commitments are serious things dont make them unless you have the support desire and means to follow through
3441963 weve been the best in the county for 25 years so its good we have better competition for us because it makes us better im glad the other teams are getting better
3441964 there is no fee to take part in these unique programs which afford individuals a weekly opportunity to interact with others in a supportive setting
3441965 in todays turbulent economy where more office space has been vacated nationally then leased for the second consecutive quarter tenant retention will be vital to sustaining and strengthening new jerseys office market
3441966 to be successful going forward landlords must accommodate the changing needs of tenants which according to our research includes things like environmental sustainability enhanced work environments and capital improvement programs which are growing trends in this quarter
3441967 unlike in the first quarter of 2008 where the northern central office market was driven by the influx of emerging small to mid size pharmaceutical companies there was little activity in this sector in the second quarter due to consolidations in the industry
3441968 while we have seen some lease activity among larger pharmaceutical companies this quarter such as johnson amp johnson and imclone the slowdown in deal flow in this sector will likely affect the health of the states market
3441969 prospective homebuyers whove had a hard time saving or have been waiting for the perfect time to buy should wait no longer
3441970 pulte is offering a rare chance to jump start home ownership or the purchase of a new home by providing a deal that when paired with current government incentives creates unheard of savings
3441971 i had only ever been to one strip club before i went to new orleans to do that movie
3441972 yeah heck yes but then i thought well this is real research ive got to do this for the role man ive got to do this but yeah it was terrifying especially when i get there this guy was a doctor apparently he was an older man and they whip out the cocaine and they start doing cocaine on the desk and im like am i incriminating myself i mean i didnt do any of the cocaine okay i just went there to observe so that was scary it was in a nice hotel the guy who took us over had a key to the room so he just opened up and the doctor is just lying in the bed and he wasnt completely naked when we got in there but he certainly got naked
3441973 later franco would tell cage about all this and it would become the inspiration for when cages character in the movie a pimp called acid yellow snorts a line and then declares
3441974 to the place where the actual bones of the apostle st james are enshrined in that silver reliquary
3441975 may they blush for shame therefore those envious people beyond the mountains who claim to have some part of it or possess relics of it
3441976 laxer11 april 29th 2008 at 7 38 pm my rankings are 1 rye 2 put valley 3 pleasentville 4 byram 5 briarcliff 6 bronxville 7 ardsley north salem 9 edgemont 10 pelham 11 nanuet 12 this one im not sure about thoughts
3441977 its very early in the season so were trying to keep them grounded but theyre happy
3441978 well phormed campaigns are not evil and neither are cookies
3441979 what happens when geeks get to make up their own job titles
3441980 the family resources fair offers a one stop location for residents to get information and advice on a variety of topics including job training programs health care information mortgage assistance and services for women children and seniors

3441983 this annual fair focuses on helping individuals and families find quality resources while showcasing each county department and program in a manner that is easily accessible
3441984 zappos really does go above and beyond and im just as comfortable there shoe shopping as i am in the store
3441985 because if youre willing to take the company up on the offer you obviously dont have the sense of commitment they are looking for and its willing to pay to learn sooner rather than later
3441986 companies dont engage emotionally with their customers people do if you want to create a memorable company you have to fill your company with memorable people
3441987 our business is based on repeat customers and word of mouth we view the money that we spend on customer service as marketing money that improves our brand
3441988 to think of all the great players weve had in this program for him to break both records in the middle of his senior year is pretty amazing
3441989 someone mentioned to me that i could do it this year
3441990 since then it was sort of in the back of my mind
3441991 it makes me think about all the guys ive played with since ive been here theyre really the reason for it
3441992 the biggest thing about him beyond his skill even is the character he has and the sportsmanship he displays
3441993 today it was nice to see everyone get to play and whenever any of those kids did something well chris was the first one to congratulate them
3441994 having your little brother hold the leaf blower so that your
3441995 the one time leaders in the nl central the brew crew are in full on crisis mode
3441996 when i first got here what our fans wanted was a competitive team more than anything else
3441997 now when theyve got guys that compete they get upset when things like the fielder parra incident happen i just dont want cookie cutter players i want guys that compete guys that play with fire and passion
3441998 in a contest against my team one year one of my players was called for a penalty coach cavaluzzi came up to him in the box and explained what he should do next time in order to not get the same call
3441999 its not automatically a slash if a kid falls down
3442000 that was a huge stone that fell from my heart
3442001 i feel happy very happy im thankful to possess such a wonderful magic horse
3442002 its always amazing to come home from your first games with some kind of bling so any color will do
3442003 i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
3442004 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things
3442005 i dont know anything about angola but angolas in trouble
3442006 so i told the coach i wanted to play football but it was really just so i could take my pads and helmet to school
3442007 money was tight we didnt have the things a lot of people had
3442008 i grew up in the city and all of a sudden i was in the country
3442009 i drove by a bunch of cows and horses and said what am i doing out
3442010 going to class it was all these different people the way they talked the way they acted i was already bigger than most of the offensive linemen id go to class and they were like who is
3442011 you learn that youre only given a certain number of chances
3442012 if you keep going back to the same things you were doing it shows that you dont learn from anything youre not a person that people can count on its all about respect and you can lose that respect people wont look up to you
3442013 you sure you want me rey maualuga not taylor mays not brian cushing
3442014 you know people expect me to be this ferocious hitter this ferocious guy who goes out and gets drunk and beats people up its just something im trying to change i dont go out as much i just go out with friends come home early and go to sleep im trying to change that perception of me
3442015 i didnt know him his freshman year when some things happened
3442016 rey has done a marvelous job of putting his world in order
3442017 hes a very good student he works out like crazy hes diligent hes a wonderful kid in the program
3442018 we struggled with him through the illness and passing of his father he took it so seriously he just needed us there was a necessity to have a close relationship
3442019 i mean its life stuff happened he needed some support he was away from his family and all that but now hes just found a real good rhythm im really excited to see his growth and maturity
3442020 because he gave me a bloody lip last year i dropped back and former usc defensive end lawrence jackson got a hold of me i kind of got away from him but as soon as i turned around rey was right there and hit me good right up under the chin
3442021 hes probably the most feared guy in the pac 10
3442022 i want to be a person the offense game plans around
3442023 i want to see that quarterback stare into my eyes with both him and me knowing i might take him out i want people to fear me but at the same time i want to just do my job and not go outside of what im supposed to be doing
3442024 if i can come out this year and do exactly what i did in the rose bowl each game i can do some great things i have to have that mind set every practice every down if im tired i have to keep competing keep playing
3442025 is it possible yes why cant i do that every game
3442026 esa noche la del 24 de marzo de 1976 analizaron con su hermano la posibilidad de que huyera pero l se neg porque no pertenec a a ning n grupo subversivo y porque no quer a abandonar a nuestra familia se qued sabiendo que lo iban a buscar
3442027 in modified lacrosse when i was a seventh grader our goalie got hurt during practice and ended up spraining his ankle pretty badly
3442028 my coach at the time asked if anyone wanted to hop in the cage and try it out
3442029 i had been playing defense at the time and wasnt exactly the best at it so i figured id give goalie a shot i ended up playing that whole year as goalie then the next i was captain of my team we went undefeated and ive been a goalie ever since
3442030 i think you definitely have to be weird in some sort of way to play
3442031 i heard today that jojo had french toast for breakfast so id say hes a lock for at least three goals
3442032 we were aggressive we believed in ourselves we played as a team we moved the ball and were unselfish
3442033 i heard one person say there was somers blood on the field from the lose
3442034 pac comes out pumped takes an early lead and holds it
3442035 they refs were favoring the home team and it was a disgrace for anyone to take part in a game that was completely one sided
3442036 town fan claimed that town beat sa and cham who are both better then wm
3442037 ground balls were 4 1 in favor of wm and
3442038 i will cry as my minipreps did not work today
3442039 let me explain the reasons why i chose to work with advisor x instead of y
3442040 its got all the bug fixes and performance enhancements that youd expect in a service pack but there are just so many new features in the net framework that were bringing to visual studio that we think sp1 is going to drive significant net adoption

3442043 the first tour was about just supporting each others music
3442044 as we got into it we realized that it became its own sound a new aesthetic
3442045 weve come to a lot of our sounds just because of the necessity of being two people and trying to make the biggest rock band we can with two people
3442046 we just played ireland last summer and the feeling was totally different
3442047 we had a standing ovation at one of the shows and i thought
3442048 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3442049 she senate majority leader harry reid and also the democrat sic presidential presumptive nominee barack obama are all committed to no new energy whether it comes from natural gas oil or coal or nuclear power
3442050 theres no reason jj cant lay it on even more
3442051 they continually earn their respect however jj recent wins over yorktown has not in my opinion earn them all the rankings and the praise
3442052 if they truly are an elite team then they should be beating other elite teams on a consistant basis and the last few years they have not
3442053 without yorktown there would be no lacrosse in the hudson valley
3442054 newer relative to town jj strong teams like rye keep developing junior programs and have good coaching at all levels youll see more teams consistently at the top
3442055 in the fight against cancer were all on the same team
3442056 blowhards on cable tv and the bloviators of the blogosphere
3442057 my daughter who has my two young grandkids mentioned him to me last night
3442058 i had heard about him but she mentioned him again and how proud she was and what kind of work he was doing
3442059 i think thats definitely something that has always been in the back of his mind
3442060 i tried to tell him to get into the water awhile ago and he was like no
3442061 or if i have enough money after i finish paying my bills maybe even twice a day
3442062 i think its more of a socio economic factor where there are some kids that just dont get the exposure to swimming and others that do
3442063 screening for past history of psychiatric and substance abuse diagnoses as a part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes
3442064 too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
3442065 i thought it would be great if we could organize these people
3442066 its amazing to pull up in the parking lot and see all these people on scooters
3442067 at first its intimidating and i keep using the david lee roth kind of scenario im not the guy doing scissor kicks and getting the crowd hyped up and twirling in a mosh pit
3442068 i could sit here and try to be more overly confident about it
3442069 i think im just not the greatest improviser in the world for me to sit in a room and kind of jam out with people is not my greatest strength
3442070 on the album theres maybe more space and things are carved out live things are kind of more bombastic and a little heavier
3442071 they kind of ditched some of us artists that had good careers
3442072 the main consideration was the national interest the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression
3442073 anytime anybody uses the r word lightly and in a joking way that is very insulting to our families
3442074 one family member described it as being hit in the stomach its absolutely not acceptable for the families and people with down syndrome
3442075 the general public probably has no clue about how hurtful this type of movie can be
3442076 in the sense that im responsible for the archdiocese i have to accept the blame
3442077 i think the decisions as i made them were based upon what was in front of me at any one time but i regret with all my heart that i didnt feel i was able to take mccormack out immediately
3442078 i think its time to call for a moratorium on the aerial spread of 1080
3442079 at the end of the day if word of aerial 1080 distribution becomes common talk amongst our clients in north america and europe i think my concession would be worth next to nothing if i dont get any visitors
3442080 if were going to protect 100 per cent pure new zealand then eco tourism is the only apparent option for each and every tourism operator
3442081 its impacted our business with quite a lot of changes to the servicing criteria i think the whole financial industry has done the same where lending is much stricter
3442082 much more detail is required checks and double checks on clients where company records might be searched and checks on shareholdings and directorships
3442083 thats a heck of a lot of kids who have received the 1000 kick start grant between 80 million and 100 million of recycled taxpayers funds and yet i see no evidence anywhere that suggests children in new zealand have a savings problem
3442084 on face value this looks like an area where national could fund their modest tax cuts whose kids are these i dont expect too many of the kids with the kick start are from underprivileged families
3442085 the crown saying its done so well is a warping of the truth kiwisaver has cost them one shed load of cash
3442086 do taxpayers realise theyre paying themselves back in kiwisaver except of course theres the additional cost of all that money going back through the inland revenue system

3442091 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3442092 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3442093 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3442094 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3442095 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3442096 i hope this exposure from the race today a kid can see this and say wow a black swimmer and hes got a gold medal
3442097 the stigma of black people dont swim is coming to an end
3442098 we had to use force and began using a blowtorch but once one hinge had been blasted off they decided to open the door
3442099 you will have to pay your fines even if you are a gang hiding behind fortified doors it has caught up with them items have been seized which they treasure
3442100 there are 10 000 needy families on the waiting list that need housing if they do it more than once they deserve to be out on the street and the home given to more needy families
3442101 as a result of this review the corporation is taking a more assertive consistent and targeted approach to managing this issue
3442102 housing new zealand made almost 13 000 applications to the tenancy tribunal in the 2007 2008 year

3442112 dashas natural endowments and beauty stunned hugh dasha has upset the pecking order by pushing her way into hughs heart

3442114 if we all wanted the same thing it wouldnt have worked because thats where all the drama would have started but were like the spice girls im the sporty one
3442115 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3442116 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3442144 i cant think of anyone i know whos less like morgan freeman than you
3442145 ive been reading his stuff for a while and the truth of the matter is that
3442146 this anthology is a huge achievement it is critically important to recognise that the aids epidemic is primarily a crisis of human lives we are in it together
3442147 india has always understood androgyny the man in the womans body the woman in the mans yet the third gender of india still need our understanding and our help
3442148 what i had seen really seen were lives lived with the intensity of art rife with metaphor raw distilled
3442149 the emotions of love and friendship youd assume would be missing or rotten in these communities existing even more so for their being sought amidst illegality fragmentation and betrayal
3442150 these were lives lived beyond ordinariness insisting on a personal story not exchangeable with any other
3442151 i was completely unaware of the scale of the aids epidemic in india before i took part in this project
3442152 i was both intellectually challenged and emotionally moved by what i saw and learned when an epidemic gains a human face and you actually meet people who are dying of this disease everything changes
3442153 we simply dont like to talk about it even to impart or receive essential life saving information
3442154 none of the doctors i met had initially been trained to face the disease what they were now was shaped by it and hiv had confronted each in a slightly different incarnation a rumour a makeshift pedagogy a death
3442155 whether it is violence addiction poverty or aids these miseries seem to take place in the state an invisible corner of india that seems to have received nothing from modernity except drugs guns and draconian laws
3442156 at the ritz carlton is a celebration that you do not want to miss
3442157 that guys been to so many pro bowls once you do that nothing really worries you any more
3442158 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3442159 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3442160 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3442161 i first met sean payton when he was an assistant with the giants
3442162 over the years weve become good friends because theres a mutual respect for what the other one does hes told me he loves how driven and focused i am about what i do he loves the intensity i have when im onstage and how passionate i am about what he does too
3442163 im not 100 per cent as far as having everything in the repertoire but its getting there
3442164 its getting there every day that i go out im able to get a little more explosion a little more speed another move that i hadnt been able to perform
3442165 im just having fun with these girls and being around them every day
3442166 we all get along and im just loving the atmosphere right now
3442167 peyton manning he was a starter split time i mean so half the time he was a starter so when he went onto he field he was not the starter there isnt a question that you would love to redshirt your freshman class todays football doesnt allow you to do that the ability to put your best team on the field may now involve a guy that comes in from high school you have to get him ready be smart cant give him too much cant overload him but lets see what they got
3442168 i am delighted that these two companies have committed to retain and create hundreds of good jobs in
3442169 this unique facility has the potential to create hundreds if not thousands of additional jobs in the future these investments represent a strong step toward accomplishing that larger goal
3442170 the states edap awards are part of a larger expansion plan to support aeroframes and northrop grummans business at chennault
3442171 our goal is to help these tenants use chennault facilities to become more efficient and competitive and drive further investment in jobs and economic impact in our region
3442172 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3442173 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3442174 it is scandalous that hundreds of thousands of older people may be denied treatment because depression is wrongly seen as a natural part of getting older
3442175 older people deserve better treatment there should be no excuse for inaction
3442176 general practitioners have a key role to play in more effectively pinpointing possible depression as patients present themselves
3442177 care home staff and managers must also ensure their own knowledge of symptoms associated with depression is improved
3442178 coffee shouldnt be about sitting in a cafe for 12 hours beckham said
3442179 coffee gets us through our workday its what we drink before we make steel for the rest of the country or head out into the fields
3442180 his disdain for the coffee chains coincided with his fear of an erosion in national pride so beckham made plans to build an old fashioned java joint near the crown point town square
3442181 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
3442182 the rwandan genocide was very dramatic and in the asian tsunami people died acutely and dramatically but in congo people are dying day in and day out from undramatic causes
3442183 my cupboard is bare we will have to wait for a family member to come here with cash before we treat him
3442184 i need 61 000 congolese francs about 120 60 for the surgery
3442185 i have all these people poor people and they are waiting for treatment some of them will die for lack of an operation that is the reality
3442186 what would be the point of doing that for five or 10 years if after that you could not look people in the eye
3442187 i am watching a lot of people dying and it hurts me these are innocent people and the government is there with its big villas and cars i cannot accept that
3442188 the president has made it clear that health is a priority
3442189 if we had people who were really patriotic it would be different
3442190 but until now we have just had people scrabbling for positions to make money
3442191 this is a toughening up of the regulations around infection control
3442192 where there are problems nhs trusts would hope that the commission would work with them to resolve the difficulties fines should be a last resort
3442193 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3442194 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3442195 people know how to ring up and make an appointment at their health clinic but they dont really know what to do about toxins in the air and global warming right
3442196 the program only represents a fraction of a percent of our toll revenue
3442197 it is a commitment that was made mostly through collective bargaining
3442198 if i get my nipples pierced will i still be able to breast feed
3442199 so which side is the gay side and which side is the straight side
3442200 is the day of the triffids a realistic representation of the future of man kind
3442201 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3442202 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
3442203 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3442204 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3442205 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
3442206 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extends our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
3442207 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute their readings
3442208 manhunt is a symptom it does well because we dont know how to relate to each other and we dont know how to take care of ourselves
3442209 manhunt is a tool big bad manhunt doesnt make guys drag themselves to the webcam and take all those pictures of their dicks
3442210 im truly excited to have an opportunity to continue and enhance the ipt presence in georgia with many great courses in the area and a very active golfer population i believe georgia can become a flagship district for the ipt and we want our share at the tour championship in november

3442217 the most important things for us is people repaying their obligations on the time they said they would absolutely key to any lending is loan serviceability as long as people adhere to their repayment then values will come and go
3442218 so long as a customer has continued to meet their agreed repayments through the term of a mortgage we would have no reason or basis to change our relationship with them when it comes to refixing
3442219 those markets are really booming so while that demand is there we would like to be able to start the waitara valley plant next year provided we can reach commercial terms for gas
3442220 our new zealand businesses have been affected throughout the period by the economic slowdown with a number of major advertisers cutting back advertising plans
3442221 its impacted our business with quite a lot of changes to the servicing criteria i think the whole financial industry has done the same where lending is much stricter
3442222 much more detail is required checks and double checks on clients where company records might be searched and checks on shareholdings and directorships
3442223 this is going to stick and it has another us10c fall in it by late 2009
3442224 it is strange times when you are celebrating the currency back to us70c and oil under us 115 a barrel
3442225 thats a heck of a lot of kids who have received the 1000 kick start grant between 80 million and 100 million of recycled taxpayers funds and yet i see no evidence anywhere that suggests children in new zealand have a savings problem

3442252 contrary to popular belief vultures are sensitive creatures and barry is particularly highly strung
3442253 in the last couple of years he has matured and started displaying 24 7 it was a nightmare
3442254 he would almost exhaust himself following everyone around desperate to mate
3442255 now they sunbathe together and sometimes the female pulls barrys tail feathers provoking a chase around the aviary
3442256 this story has a happy ending but it could get even better if they have chicks
3442257 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3442259 why are there no adult choose your own adventure books
3442260 there is an ocean at puri i feel that my ship will come and take me back to the land of my origin
3442261 my ship has come my son sing our lords names to create the wind that will carry me to my eternal home
3442262 there is something you have not told us the villagers have sent us to discover how you can be so happy in the face of so much traumatic loss
3442263 gurudeva noticed quite early in our relationship that i was a slow learner
3442264 but he became ill in puri he was preparing for his ship journey home not long before he died he gave me an envelope and said open this only after i have boarded my ship
3442265 after his death i opened the envelope and found a pencil and a handwritten message
3442266 the pencil teaches you to stop from time to time to sharpen your tools meaning your mind body and spirit just as a pencil needs to be sharpened so we need to sharpen ourselves by spiritual practice only then can we become one pointed enough to give full attention to the lord
3442267 third the pencil teaches you that what is inside is more important than what is outside in other words that the soul is more important than the body
3442268 fifth you may do big things in life but never forget the hand that guides you just as the pencil is never proud thinking how it has written a book so we should always give credit to god and strive to become humble and willing instruments by surrendering to his plan
3442269 my dear disciple think daily about my gift to you the five lessons of the pencil
3442270 i am practicing gurudevas teachings and am making new discoveries every day if the villagers have questions they are welcome to ask me
3442271 you should be a good disciple a good teacher a servant who helps others in their spiritual development and you should be autonomous in your spiritual life fully dependent on krsna
3442272 everyday ecstasy see the divine in everything when you practice bhakti the yoga of devotion
3442273 we welcome the criticism and praise we receive from readers it helps us to refine our alignment and explore beyond our normal boundaries
3442274 for me bhakti means whatever strikes your heart with beauty whatever hits the mark of your heart and inspires you to feel the love
3442275 some western yogis dabble in bhakti yoga through an occasional prayer or kirtan but if youre a serious practitioner looking to find union with the divine a more rigorous practice is in order
3442276 that in itself wont be sufficient to have a transformative effect that will penetrate into the deepest and darkest parts of your being
3442277 i dont think most people in the yoga community have a concept of the degree of emotional depth and intensity and texture that is necessary for bhakti yoga really to flower
3442278 have a transformative effect that will penetrate into the deepest and darkest parts of your being
3442279 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment please leave me alone please im asking you i cant live like this please give me a little bit of respect im just trying to fucking fill up my car

3442301 we dont take this action lightly we love this airline and we need it to succeed
3442302 the three major constituencies customers employees and stakeholders have all suffered due to his leadership
3442303 this is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from alpas illegal activity cited in our lawsuit which details the organised and concerted effort to harm our customers our employees and our performance
3442304 everyone is concerned that if airlines are not making money we could be moving towards another round of job losses and budget cuts

3442309 wave of misgovernment has been brought to you by an ideology not incompetence
3442310 numbers racket why the economy is worse than we know
3442311 wall street after two terms of a business friendly republican president self immolated on a pyre of greed incompetence and excessive optimism
3442312 life is a series of problems do we want to moan about them or solve them
3442313 bubbles are primarily social phenomena until we understand and address the psychology that fuels them theyre going to keep forming
3442314 few people seem immune to boom thinking the recent bubble grew so large partly because the very people responsible for the financial systems oversight came to share the general publics rosy expectations
3442315 we recently lived through two epidemics of excessive financial optimism i believe we are close to a third episode only this one will spread irrational pessimism and distrust not exuberance our economic problems will become much worse than they need to be and our social problems will multiply
3442316 through history outrageous financial behavior has been met with outrage but today wall streets damaging recklessness has been met with near silence from a too tolerant populace

3442324 there are striking similarities between americas current situation and that of another great power from the past rome
3442325 worth remembering declining moral values and political civility at home an overconfident and overextended military in foreign lands and fiscal irresponsibility by the central government
3442326 civilizations share a sharp curve of decline indeed a societys demise may begin only a decade or two after it reaches its peak population wealth and power
3442327 rich and powerful must be deliberately causing catastrophes so that they can exploit them
3442328 an economic system that requires constant growth while bucking almost all serious attempts at environmental regulation generates a steady stream of disasters all on its own whether military economical or financial the appetite for easy short profits offered by purely speculative investment has turned the stock currency and real estate markets into crisis creation machines
3442329 a very common question that women who are five year breast cancer survivors ask us as oncologists is what is my risk of recurrence of breast cancer now and thats a number that weve had a hard time coming up with

3442371 whether stevens knew he received more than 250 in benefits from a source that he did not repay

3442424 because we believe in the privacy and equality of women we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
3442425 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3442426 there are millions of evangelicals and catholics who rightly expect their own moral convictions on abortion to be included and respected in the party
3442427 the new democratic party platform takes a significant step forward in affirming women whose moral convictions lead them to make a different decision than abortion when facing this difficult choice
3442428 you should see dicks face light up when we tour a chinese prison

3442433 eraserheads members should not allow themselves to be deceived by philip morris and should protect their fans from this devious marketing ploy considered one of the most influential bands in the philippines eraserheads has become a role model for our youth i hope they will rise to the challenge and help young filipinos lead healthy tobacco free lives by finding other sponsorship for the concert
3442434 once again philip morris international has been caught engaging in cigarette marketing that appeals to children in a developing country and that would not be tolerated in the united states and other wealthier nations
3442435 the issue isnt just whether philip morris international has violated philippine law but whether tobacco companies should be engaged in such youth oriented marketing anywhere philip morris international should immediately cease all such sponsorships and promotions in all countries

3442457 i feel like we have made a lot of improvements on our cars since the last race at michigan
3442458 everything that we are racing now is totally different from where we were with bump stops chassis and all the different things that are on our cars now performance wise we have made big gains
3442459 michigan is one of those places that you need the entire package to compete for the win being successful has a lot do with the horsepower that is under the hood and i think our engine department has stepped up over the past several months as well i look forward to a strong finish this weekend
3442460 i think the maturity of my team has gotten us in the top 12
3442461 we have had a lot of stuff go wrong this year and we are still in the hunt my guys dont sit back and count points and they dont worry about who we are racing as you get closer to the chase you kind of go about your business and do the best you can do
3442462 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in

3442471 the good lord is praying that were able to keep our car up front every week weve just been fortunate to run as well as we have at places and yet weve struggled at a couple others weve got some work to do
3442472 i heard earlier today that the 48 of jimmie johnson has been testing like 18 times this year and stuff and weve tested a couple places but nothing like that
3442473 weve got some tests lined up and were going to try to learn something and keep our mojo going and keep it going through and into the chase
3442474 it feels good to clinch a spot in the chase to begin with after three years
3442475 the 18 car has been through a lot since ive been there but you know like i say the 48 of johnson and the 9 of kasey kahne and those guys have picked up their game and i think weve got to get on top of it and weve got some stuff coming that were going to try at testing it feels good to go in on top but its a lot of work to stay there this team will dig down deep and i think that well be just fine but weve got to work hard to get there
3442476 theres still more opportunities for us to be able to win another one just to increase our point total for the start of the chase
3442477 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in

3442515 if a girl wants to be a cam girl theres a voting process that they have to go through with the senior models moderators and staff within the members forums in order to be considered
3442516 we use this system because we like to know who our members want to see and theres no better way than having them vote additionally we dont use any studios because we have yet to find a good studio with the quality of girls that we like to maintain if we ever find one that does work out with our site we would consider it nevertheless we endeavor to offer only the hottest top quality models on our site and our process caters to that

3442521 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3442522 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3442524 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

3442528 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3442529 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3442530 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3442531 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3442532 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3442533 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3442534 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

3442558 va medical center in st louis helps all veterans and it is designated as a polytrauma center for treating veterans wounded in iraq and afghanistan they hope to break ground in september and open a year later
3442559 will donate the site and staff it but government funds cant be used for construction half of the 5 million cost of construction must be raised by the fisher house of st louis group and the remainder will be provided by the national fisher house foundation
3442560 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3442561 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3442562 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3442563 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3442564 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3442565 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3442566 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3442567 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3442568 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3442569 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3442570 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3442571 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3442572 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3442573 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3442574 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3442575 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3442576 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3442581 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3442582 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3442583 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3442584 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3442585 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3442586 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic
3442587 lets just make some versions of that with photoshop magic and re create them almost exactly
3442588 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3442589 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3442590 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3442594 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3442595 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3442596 this is something major for the streets a lot of people who didnt or who dont normally get love from other outlets can count on ozone to shed some light on them
3442597 after all these years the only award ive ever received was a ozone award
3442598 so i love the show its the third year it keeps getting better
3442599 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3442600 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3442601 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3442602 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3442603 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3442604 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3442605 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3442606 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3442607 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3442608 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3442612 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3442613 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right
3442614 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3442615 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3442616 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3442617 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3442618 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3442619 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3442620 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3442621 it details all city expenditures and revenues over the year

3442633 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3442634 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3442635 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3442636 their guarantees amounted to nothing more than statements and some futile discussions at the un security council

3442647 a very common question that women who are five year breast cancer survivors ask us as oncologists is what is my risk of recurrence of breast cancer now and thats a number that weve had a hard time coming up with
3442648 therefore we would also expect a rise in the number of elderly patients with stroke in the future
3442649 unfortunately limited information is available on stroke care in patients over age 80
3442650 the main significance is that on average patients who lose weight following diagnosis have better glycemic and blood pressure control than patients who dont even if they subsequently regain the lost weight
3442651 this is encouraging because people who lose weight often have trouble keeping the weight off were saying thats ok its still worthwhile to lose it
3442652 the weight gain and weight loss groups began and ended at similar average weights
3442653 like the physical and emotional harm caused by medical errors the financial consequences dont stop at the hospital door

3442674 we have shown that with the use of current advanced high strength steels a vehicles body structure mass can be reduced by at least 25 percent
3442675 however with the new third generation steels now under development we expect to achieve more than 35 percent in structural mass reduction which will significantly help automakers improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
3442676 during the production stage of a vehicle a low density material such as aluminum will emit significantly more greenhouse gas emissions to the environment than steel

3442724 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected

3442726 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
3442727 we had a hard fought campaign and it was exciting it was a bit like the proverbial roller coaster but we are now unified and ready to go forward together
3442728 and it is imperative that each and every one of us think about how were going to help in this election

3442732 in germany we always said the biggest thing to win is the league title because it is a competition for the whole season so we are looking for this title and also the champions league
3442733 we have a big target to win not just one title but go for all four so we need a big squad
3442734 the last few seasons we have done very well and we were very close but we want to win these titles and this season we will try again
3442735 if you dont know whats wrong after about five or six months and you have no improvement it is difficult in your mind to motivate yourself
3442736 to walk in the gym to walk with the physio and feel a little bit of an improvement then you get the motivation and you can keep going
3442737 but if you have no improvement then thats difficult and so i was very happy after i came back in december to play and come so close to a title
3442738 the confidence among the players is as high as i have known
3442739 every player has looked back at last season and seen how close we were despite the injuries and everything that happened
3442740 this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well they play very good football and had a fantastic season
3442741 so i am very happy to come here with the opportunity to play in the premier league we are also playing in europe this season so that will be good
3442742 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here
3442743 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3442744 well still have some players coming in to give us a chance and if were lucky enough to qualify for the group stages of the uefa cup that would take us right up to christmas and well most definitely need the squad
3442745 last season we were exceptionally lucky with injuries eight or nine players played over 30 games and we didnt have big runs in the fa or league cup therefore we were able to concentrate on the league
3442746 all that could change this season and the fact is that we need the squad to be bigger to cope with that thats what were trying to do
3442747 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed

3442752 why dont you just let it be why dont you be classy
3442753 i think your able to see what it look like out there and the guys running around a little bit and kind of get that vibe from the crowd
3442754 itll take some adjusting but i think well be ready guys have been around here long enough who can kind of guide us and make sure were doing the right things
3442755 theres always something to work on no matter how good it is out there
3442756 whether we put up 400 yards or 100 theres always something we can improve on and thats what we plan on doing
3442757 im always looking forward to getting out there running some routes and getting to compete a little bit
3442758 a loss to them today would have meant almost elimination
3442759 today we moved the ball better everybody was involved everybody scored
3442760 and when you play like that its easier because everybody feels important
3442761 i think the difference was that we started playing defense from the beginning
3442762 we could control the game when we have a lead of 15 or 16 points with these really physical teams we need to take control on defense first

3442768 i am excited that we will continue our relationship with fort wayne and am proud that the padres will be the organization that opens the wizards new downtown ballpark
3442769 none of this would have been possible without the efforts of mike nutter and his staff and i hope to bring a midwest league championship to fort wayne soon

3442815 es sabido que los puertos est n contaminados lo que nosotros investigamos es hasta qu punto los contaminantes est n al alcance de los organismos acu ticos
3442816 tomamos mejillones de aguas limpias y los situamos en los lugares que queremos analizar para comprobar cu nta contaminaci n acumulan y de qu tipo
3442817 de estudiar las consecuencias de los contaminantes sobre los mejillones se encargan los bi logos gallegos nosotros medimos la concentraci n de contaminantes que reciben los mejillones
3442818 hoy en d a el tbt est prohibido pero es muy duradero y a n puede encontrarse en el agua
3442819 estos ltimos son similares a las dioxinas y antes se utilizaban en transformadores muy potentes tambi n est n prohibidos pero a n permanecen en el agua
3442820 colocamos 20 30 mejillones en unos soportes de pl stico dentro de gasas y los sumergimos a dos metros de profundidad
3442821 al cabo de un tiempo determinado los recogemos y analizamos el nivel y el tipo de contaminaci n que han acumulado
3442822 en algunos lugares la contaminaci n es demasiado elevada y los mejillones pueden morir
3442823 a trav s de unos soportes polim ricos simulamos qu micamente lo que hacen los mejillones es decir la acumulaci n de contaminantes
3442824 la situaci n en el puerto de bilbao es bastante homog nea hemos tomado muestras de la zona de getxo santurce y el puerto exterior y hemos obtenido resultados similares en todas ellas en cambio en vigo hemos detectado grandes diferencias de una zona a otra por ejemplo entre las aguas cercanas a un astillero al mar abierto
3442825 queremos saber si nuestra metodolog a y las herramientas de muestreo que hemos desarrollado sirven para ese fin
3442826 por un lado hemos visto que las zonas supuestamente limpias no lo est n tanto como cre amos es necesario afinar la selecci n de esas zonas limpias por el otro tambi n estamos perfeccionando la herramienta que simula qu micamente el papel de los mejillones para realizar muestreos a n m s precisos

3442847 its a little bit bigger than pluto and the main difference of course is its much much farther away than pluto right now so its going to be a much colder place to be not a very pleasant place to live definitely and life as we know it would certainly not be doing much out there
3442848 if you were standing on the surface and you held a pin at arms length you could cover the sun with the head of the pin as i said its not a place youd want to go for a summer vacation now in 280 years itll be a lot closer but it still wont be much of a vacation spot then either
3442849 even if it reflected 100 percent of the light reaching it it would still be as big as pluto
3442850 id say its probably one and a half times the size of pluto but were not sure yet of the final size
3442851 i dont want to say what it is yet because we really want this name to get accepted and we want to make sure we go through all the proper channels
3442852 even i have promoted the idea that we should consider pluto not to be a planet and a kuiper belt object instead
3442853 but historically its been called a planet for such a long time that i think were never going to not call pluto a planet and thats fine i think historically we can call it a planet
3442854 then anything larger than pluto i think we should draw the line there anything larger than pluto is a planet things that are smaller i think we just call them typical members of the kuiper belt and they dont join this very special class of things that are planets

3442930 constant abuse threats and a lack of gratitude for the job they do
3442931 even if we have a couple of the subs running the lines the on field stuff will have to be sorted out by the players themselves i would like to think the gentlemanly spirit of competition would lead the boys to treat it properly and fairly but something tells me every club will now be investing in a very forceful centre midfielder to argue with the opposition players over free kicks im trying to get keano to come out of retirement

3442970 its the same physics for soccer balls as for all other curving balls
3442971 bottom line a spinning ball deflects the air rushing by it and the air responds by deflecting the ball this effect shows up in volleyball it shows up in golf you can really curve a beach ball without too much trouble
3442972 when the ball is spinning the air tends to follow a longer path around one side than the other because its dragged along by the balls turning surface
3442973 for a ball lift can be in any direction depending on the direction the ball is spinning
3442974 as it spins a ball draws the air with it and deflects the wake to one side

3443069 the judge could not dismiss the husbands claim that the monies invested in the egyptian hotels came from external sources simply on the absence of a positive case
3443070 it has been hard fought over six weeks including judicial reading and judgment writing time
3443071 the case has been run as if it were a complex piece of commercial litigation
3443072 the scope of this enquiry has been enormous in fact i have been asked to deal with a range of issues some going back twenty five years i have to make detailed findings about these matters because they all form part of a large jigsaw puzzle which has required each piece to be in place before the overall story could unfold with clarity
3443073 accordingly it is easy to see that the amount expended on fighting the case in the context of the value of the potential claim has been wholly disproportionate in fact on one view the money spent on costs amount to over 70 of the maximum claim this defies commercial sense but it is a pointer to the ferocity with which the husband has chosen to defend his position from a family perspective all this a tragedy
3443074 it does not seem to me that it is proper for this court to sanction an underpayment because of potential difficulties with enforcement

3443090 at the time of his indictment mr atack expressed confidence in his acquittal and steadfastly maintained his innocence
3443091 the government dismissed the indictment after atacks counsel requested that the charges be reviewed by the united states attorneys office in light of exculpatory evidence brought to their attention by counsel

3443098 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3443099 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3443100 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community

3443103 many supposed beneficiaries of the 300 billion in fha loans will be unable to qualify for these products many used no doc loans to qualify the first time and in truth did not have the means to satisfy their debt obligations in the current economy it is unlikely things have changed
3443104 i believe allowing the free market economy to resolve this problem would have been the best and fastest solution in parts of the greater phoenix market we are already seeing stability this legislation is likely to provide more confusion than solution
3443105 however such a solution does not provide politicians with sound bites and votes
3443106 the message i took away was the social networks blogs are the door we still have to be face to face with people to make it happen that will never change in my opinion its what we do and how we treat the consumer when they walk in the door from all the sites available
3443107 going through the trash yes even at the landfill is one of the primary ways that identities are stolen if you have paper records it would seem reasonable that if the information got out in any manner you could indeed be liable
3443108 i think green is the way to go but before those papers get tossed shred them with a cross cut shredder available from an office supply store alternatively you can hire a company to come on site and shred your paper documents and certify in writing that the documents were destroyed
3443109 cross cut shredding is the only way outside of burning to securely destroy documents

3443112 most washington politicians think rural america is a place you fly over on your way from new york to california
3443113 senator obama understands the challenges facing families in rural iowa because he is from the heartland and has held more than 100 town hall meetings across the state senator obama is the only candidate who will truly fight to strengthen our family farms and rural communities and bring real change to washington

3443122 when the research firm realtytrac inc releases its latest foreclosure report thursday dont be surprised if the number of filings declines again last month realtytrac reported that foreclosure filings totaled 252 363 in june down 3 from the previous month some analysts are expecting the july data to show another decline or very little change if that happens could the improvement be a sign that the foreclosure problem is ebbing probably not the data may reflect several developments aimed at reducing foreclosures including new state and municipal laws that put a temporary moratorium on foreclosures such laws are designed to give homeowners more time to work with their lenders and modify troubled loans some cynics say the laws are designed to give the appearance that the housing crisis is easing ahead of the november elections

3443124 we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3443125 our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3443126 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese us adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities

3443133 the bush administration has consistently supported the unborn however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
3443134 still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
3443135 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
3443136 we remain concerned by the regulations potential to create barriers for women seeking health care to jeopardize federal programs that provide family planning services and to disrupt state laws securing womens access to birth control
3443137 unconscionable that the administration would even consider putting womens health and prevention in jeopardy
3443138 secretary leavitts vague comments on the draft hhs rule do nothing to reassure americans that the administration is not considering redefining abortion to include forms of contraception thereby jeopardizing womens access to basic health care
3443139 the administration needs to stop playing word games with womens health and state clearly they will reject any regulations that will undermine womens access to basic health care
3443140 bush and his political appointees have a long long record of attacks on contraception so secretary leavitts claim that the department never intended to target birth control isnt believable
3443141 will continue to engage our activists and work with leaders in congress to stop this administration from pushing a last ditch attack on birth control as bush prepares to leave the white house in the face of growing public outrage over this attack on birth control the bush administration is trying to backtrack
3443142 center for reproductive rights said that in addition to objections over the definition of abortion her group is concerned that the proposal
3443143 it allows everybody whether you are a receptionist or a maintenance person
3443144 these laws mandate the availability of emergency contraception in emergency rooms bar pharmacies from flatly refusing to fill prescriptions and mandate coverage of contraception when other prescriptions are covered
3443145 given that at least 17 5 million women in america are in need of publicly funded contraceptive services we believe the department should be working to increase access to these crucial health care services rather than working to limit them
3443146 there is no reason to doubt an intent within the administration to cater to fundamentalist and anti women agendas during president bushs final months in power
3443147 clearly impinge on states laws on emergency contraception and potentially on whether employers insurance companies are required to cover contraceptive services
3443148 only sustained public and political pressure can stop the repeal of a half century of progress in family planning

3443234 universities and tertiary educational institutions accounted for 1 29 percent of taiwans energy consumption which cost the schools about nt 2 billion u 64 1 million in electricity bills

3443236 and if it goes into hibernation after 20 minutes 97 5 percent of its running power can be saved
3443237 1 700 units can be saved each year that could cut annual electricity bills by nt 5 040

3443313 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3443314 being famous means being notorious and the price you pay is high but to achieve my goal i had to sacrifice my privacy it wasnt easy it was a fierce struggle for me
3443315 no matter whether you are a man or a woman you were born at a bad time on a bad day in a bad month in a bad year under a very bad star
3443316 if there is the so called next life i beg god to let me be an ordinary man or an ordinary woman whatever gender it may be but to be as normal as other people it seems a very simple dream but for me and my friends being normal is impossible
3443317 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3443318 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3443319 theyre the no 1 team in the world you dont win two matches and all of the sudden claim the mantle of best team
3443320 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3443321 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3443322 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3443323 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3443324 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3443325 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3443326 williamson expressed his support for the mission and concern over the fact deployment is so slow
3443327 china has reached the point where it no longer seeks to mollify or accommodate the international communitys expressions of concern about human rights
3443328 no one expects the games to lead to regime collapse in china especially not immediately but change yes by denying the communist party its moment of glory the dissonance created by the olympic year will accelerate the values transformation in china needed to erode the regimes popular support
3443329 i love the little metallic filigree that runs along the underside of the wing
3443330 it just wrenches my stomach to see whats happening there
3443331 if we dont do something soon these things are going to be lost
3443332 we have a lot of money off the tax rolls in this town
3443333 nowhere near what wed get if the land were taxed at full rate
3443334 being the second smallest town in connecticut we dont have a big industrial base
3443335 so any revenue we get from that kind of operation helps the town a lot
3443336 we met on site and walked the top of the hill
3443337 he said they had no plans to expand substantially over the next year and that they would coordinate with us
3443338 i was i guess shocked is not too strong a word to see how quickly it had progressed
3443339 and this is the most rapid expansion of the quarry ive ever seen in those 30 years
3443340 the dorsal side is muted browns and oranges they have pretty green eyes but the flashy colors are all on the underside
3443341 if someone said hey youve got to do something about century aggregates then wed move on it
3443342 but theres been no public outcry and i dont think people are likely to cry out about a butterfly
3443343 have been since day 1 but i think were sort of crossing cultures in that they dont know exactly what mining entails and i dont know exactly what butterfly counting entails
3443344 hi weve never met but i know someone who has a vague idea of who you are and he thinks you should give me a job
3443345 nevertheless this malaysian tree shrew is never drunk this suggests a beneficial effect and sheds a whole new light on the evolution of human alcoholism
3443346 the pen tailed tree shrew is considered a living model for extinct mammals representing the stock from which all extinct and living tree shrews and primates radiated
3443347 therefore we hypothesize that moderate to high alcohol intake was present early on in the evolution of these closely related lineages
3443348 alcohol use and abuse can no longer be blamed on the inventors of brewing of about 9 000 years ago
3443349 so far the current theories on alcoholism have stated that mankind and its ancestors were either used to taking no alcohol at all or maybe only low doses via fruits before the onset of beer brewing
3443350 whether he was a thief or a good faith purchaser we couldnt come to a conclusion on that all we know is he ended up with this stuff
3443351 we decided the best and most expeditious course of action was to publicize the artwork to the general public
3443352 whether he was a thief or a good faith purchaser we couldnt come to a conclusion on that
3443353 all we know is he ended up with this stuff
3443354 the victim in the present case was a foreigner lady who was totally dependent on the hospitality provided to her by our people
3443355 without fully employing its abilities even at the final moment the imperial nation is surrendering before the enemies propaganda
3443356 i never imagined the torpor of the nations leaders and people
3443357 will come off as a complete loser by accepting unconditional surrender even if it makes a few demands
3443358 the wave of violence includes men women children and all professions and social levels
3443359 bold action to address what may be the defining issue of our era
3443360 it also has the benefit of reducing our air pollution and reducing our energy consumption
3443361 if we thought we were finished we would have lost
3443362 thats what the chinese do so well against us they fight when theyre down then come back
3443363 they never give us anythng so it was fantastic to turn that on them for a change and come back from five points down in the third set
3443364 its clear the momentum is only just starting to pick up
3443365 there is no silver bullet and there never will be
3443366 users on shared systems can easily set up a simple pin code to protect any card from use by other users
3443367 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3443368 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3443369 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3443370 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3443371 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3443372 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3443373 we will advise on the issues as we move forward
3443374 auspicious development that has paved the way for full scale negotiations raising the prospect for an all inclusive government
3443375 it is regrettable that our detractors continue to impose more sanctions
3443376 we therefore call on britain and its allies to remove sanctions to enable us to freely chart our destinies
3443377 in order to fetch all families that wish to come back
3443378 convinced of the falsehood of the allegations spread by malicious scaremongers in the west
3443379 need seven times the resources of japan almost six times the resources of the us and almost three times the resources used by india
3443380 will end soon because the environment can no longer keep pace
3443381 through collaboration with our us neighbors we will maximize both scientific and financial resources while collecting important data as part of canadas submission to the un by 2013
3443382 we will call the governors and the sectors unions and rural workers groups to dialogue
3443383 to seize this opportunity to begin a frank dialogue to resolve outstanding issues and define a way forward that unites all bolivians
3443384 to be a good partner in bolivias journey to a more democratic prosperous future
3443385 if required the spanish government reiterates its availability to support any effort in this direction
3443386 we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalization
3443387 we thought it could be a very easy game for us obviously that was a misunderstanding
3443388 i could never get the feel of my release point i tried to do my best but instead was consistently off
3443389 even though i kept making adjustments i still wasnt accurate i was even surprised by how poorly i performed
3443390 my coach told me to be more aggressive and more active in attacking and so i did it and the rest of the bout went smoothly
3443391 i feel as though i am dreaming and now im more confident about the team event
3443392 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
3443393 ive been watching the scoring here the first four days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it
3443394 you expect a slight bias for the home team but you come to the olympic games and expect a level playing field joe didnt box the best ive seen him but the scoring makes a difference and the tactics had to be changed because of the scoring everything the chinese guy touched they pressed the button for him
3443395 its most satisfying to get back what they took from us
3443396 what happened in athens gave us wings for this achievement
3443397 its always amazing to come home from your first games with some kind of bling so any color will do
3443398 it was really good work by birgit to get by two defenders
3443399 its typical birgit to go like that and win it but as a forward i have to expect and anticipate that the goalkeeper will not be able to hold that shot
3443400 it was a tough day out there i think the trick to the day was just trying to keep it simple
3443401 it was good sailing shifty the current was changing throughout the race tough conditions for sure but fun
3443402 recently the congress passed with my support important legislation that expands the education benefits for our returning service members
3443403 while i support expanding the current g i bill attaching tax increases on small business owners many of whom are veterans themselves or create jobs for veterans is the wrong way to go
3443404 i just wanted to be out at the 50m point and thats where i was
3443405 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3443406 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3443407 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3443408 the gold medal is the best birthday present i have ever had
3443409 i hope the luck can be with me all the time
3443410 i hope to be diving with her for a long time
3443411 we have a whole program planned for us which includes what time we get up and when we train
3443412 this is all decided by our coaches we were told we shouldnt give too much focus on the olympics just treat it like any other competition and be relaxed
3443413 this is a big competition and its being held in china so there was a lot of pressure to perform at our best
3443414 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3443415 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3443416 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3443417 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3443418 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3443419 the sdga staff works hard to take our students golf skills to the next level and to prepare them for the golf job of their choice
3443420 we are extremely proud of aaron in his success as it validates what we do here everyday prepare our students to be the best they can be in our industry
3443421 we must certainly agree that for the most part doctrinal development has not been brought about by logical deduction and that even afterwards the logic sometimes is not clear
3443422 follows a logic which often goes beyond the purely rational expression which we instinctively try to give it
3443423 i was actually glad to have made the final for the first time after missing out at sydney and athens so to win the gold is amazing
3443424 the big guns were out there you try not to look but i knew they were not missing many
3443425 were not trying to put on a show were trying to play the game the way we know how to play
3443426 usa softball plays the game hard plays the game aggressively playing it smart and thats my concern
3443427 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3443428 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3443429 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3443430 in washington d c all calls were dropped after a second or two
3443431 this deployment was especially challenging because we needed to integrate different kinds of wireless networks as well as av compression with wimax
3443432 proxims end to end wireless product portfolio is ideal for such a deployment since the equipment provides end to end qos which is critical for voice and video and enables us to customize a network to meet the precise wireless needs of our customers
3443433 cryptography is easy to get wrong developers can often choose the wrong cipher mode use obsolete algorithms compose primitives in an unsafe manner or fail to anticipate the need for key rotation keyczar abstracts some of these details by choosing safe defaults automatically tagging outputs with key version information and providing a simple interface
3443434 i dont think the conflict will have big consequences at least if it doesnt escalate
3443435 the main problem for russia is that investor perception which was already low will deteriorate even further
3443436 the very fact of the conflict is not putting investors in the mood to invest in russia
3443437 the events themselves of course have an influence on the outflow of capital but they cant significantly change the fundamentals
3443438 russia is a very strong country in terms of economic development
3443439 the country is trying to enter the world trade organization and this armed conflict with georgia will make that process even more difficult
3443440 the conflict with georgia empowers the hardliners in russia economic reform in russia will be delayed
3443441 russia is an immediate neighbor you cant wish it doesnt exist
3443442 i dont think europeans will say we dont want to have to do anything with this country but europeans will think we trusted too much that russia would become more like a western country
3443443 theres no doubt that whats happening has increased the investment risk within georgia and the region
3443444 this is one more step by the russians trying to increase their power among their former satellites that raises questions over further foreign investment in georgia as well as countries like azerbaijan and ukraine
3443445 el financiamiento se viene evaluando con el rea de planeamiento y presupuesto del concejo de huaral que servir para que alrededor de 50 j venes se beneficien de dicho proyecto siendo cubierto el gasto general que requiere una formaci n profesional o acad mica
3443446 of course if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it
3443447 we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature it is quite a complex matter and we cant just make a judgment on the spot but clearly we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offense
3443448 we are not experts in law in every country so it is wise to speak with the people who are
3443449 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3443450 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3443451 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3443452 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts on thursday against chivas usa
3443453 the one guys loyalty and passion over there i dont question is his i think we have eliminated any and all excuses now no one can point any fingers
3443454 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful
3443455 playing arsenal will be a great experience for the players and if they dont become better players after playing against arsenal they shouldnt be in football
3443456 bobby said go go to holland its a great place to work and he said i had two great years at psv and he said go on your own you will love it the people are good good people good coaches good players and he is right so far
3443457 there was advice that we received from the security consultants that it might be better not to start the competition from the 11th and move to the 12th
3443458 it is a strong possibility that we will reduce the champions trophy to two venues but the event will be played in pakistan
3443459 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3443460 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
3443461 the overwhelming majority of studies that have been published in scientific journals around the globe show that wireless phones do not pose a health risk
3443462 carroll will star in tv adverts and travel the world to meet lara croft fans
3443463 this is a fantastic opportunity and i am really looking forward to embracing laras world
3443464 i still cant believe they chose me to take on the role of lara and i cant wait to get stuck in this is my dream job i have always wanted to be an action hero and hope to be able to use my gymnastic ability to perform all of laras stunts
3443465 if you solve that problem you are enabling them to enter the economy
3443466 but weve all been on a college campus and have seen a person who looks too young to be in college
3443467 when we saw it we said jim youve got a product here
3443468 theres lots of cities just like us that need this technology
3443469 when the iphone came out we were excited about the big screen the graphics chip and the good components
3443470 we thought it was an opportunity too big to pass up
3443471 there was a long protracted series of text messages that culminated in the offense
3443472 it is a series of messages followed by a series of threats
3443473 the main reason for my comeback is to help the club but i also want to play again
3443474 our operating margin is improving in the second quarter helped by better cost control and operation efficiency we expect the margin to trend up further in the second half of the year
3443475 the operation of our subsidiaries and core businesses are trending up this quarter
3443476 samsung seems to have hit a sweet spot with the anycall series and we can reasonably expect to reach 20 percent market share in the third quarter and 25 percent by fourth quarter
3443477 users ages 24 to 34 who are keen on design audio and visual capabilities
3443478 edible oil prices are expected to go up further which will in turn help boost company revenue however whether the price increases will offset rising costs will require further observation
3443479 more coverage is the key issue because we are offering more channels than normal tv
3443480 to help strengthen national unity and provide momentum for business leaders and all the people to make joint efforts to reinvigorate the economy and create new jobs
3443481 however i made the bold decision considering that business leaders face difficulties traveling abroad and they are being deterred from making new investment
3443482 this amnesty will only strengthen the public belief that the rich always get away with any wrongdoing
3443483 by tolerating corporate crimes the government has damaged the spirit of law observance which threatens the long term growth of the korean economy
3443484 cute amp spicy latina consuelo goes camping for the first time part 12
3443485 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3443486 as robots enter our everyday life they need to have sensors everywhere on their bodies like humans
3443487 imagine they bump into babies robots need to feel temperatures heat and pressure like we do to coexist otherwise it would be dangerous
3443488 it could be completely integrated into the normal driving system making users unaware of using it
3443489 objects that come into contact with humans are often not square or flat we believe interfaces between humans and electronics should be soft
3443490 we cant rule out the possibility of using this in living bodies but were sticking to using it in electronics
3443491 investors may take profit in technology shares in near term if the taiwan dollar continues strengthening given no other catalyst
3443492 the sole purpose of this buyback is to remove partially the dilution from employee profit sharing
3443493 this weak sentiment indicates japans revival will need to come from global demand not consumer spending
3443494 were just seeing the beginning of a recession and conditions could deteriorate even further
3443495 the producer price data provide some very modest relief on the inflation front with the rise in output prices being modestly below expectations and input prices falling
3443496 the bank of england will probably be modestly relieved overall with the july producer price inflation data but it is very far from out of the inflation woods yet
3443497 while pipeline price pressures in the uk economy remain very strong there is some tentative evidence that they may be close to a peak
3443498 for the first time in 10 months producers raw material costs fell in july
3443499 the mpc will remain on guard for signs that the sharp rises in pipeline price pressures seen over the last year are feeding through into inflation on the high street for some months yet but there does at last seem to be some light emerging at the end of the inflation tunnel
3443500 the bank of england will probably be modestly relieved overall with the july producer price inflation data but it is very far from out of the inflation woods yet with consumer price inflation still likely to near 5 0 percent later this year
3443501 he was a fierce competitor but he always found humor in situations

3443507 mobileme members were intermittently unable to access mobileme mail using a desktop e mail application iphone or ipod touch access to www me com mail was unaffected normal service has been restored
3443508 why pay for a service that is completely and utterly miserable that is a question that i am consistently asking myself getting mobileme was probably one of the worst decisions ive made
3443509 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3443510 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3443511 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3443512 she is attending and there was some sort of clerical error in which somebody said she was hosting but she is not
3443513 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3443514 like many im astounded at barack obamas meteoric rise as a candidate but i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
3443515 the risk aversion to lending to financial institutions is still high and everyone is still very cautious
3443516 to continue to be weak for capital markets to remain under stress and for a continued decline in us housing prices
3443517 these factors have affected and are likely to continue to adversely impact the firms credit losses overall business volumes and earnings
3443518 the investment banking division restructuring will take months to yield results
3443519 ubs has had a large number of write offs and theyve told us on a number of occasions that this is the end of it and it hasnt been
3443520 the key message from this months nab business survey is that the sharp slowdown in domestic demand continued through july and more importantly that the rate of slowing has in recent months accelerated
3443521 the pure girl like world inside of me that is what lolita is all about
3443522 i think many japanese women feel intimidated by high fashion in the west and feel that they can never live up to the refined beauty that they feel western women strive for
3443523 so instead they shoot for a cute look one that doesnt require tall curvaceous bodies and instead emphasizes girlishness
3443524 one of the salient points about lolita is that it is really a fashion that is not intended to attract men
3443525 the women are creating their own world into which they can get away from the pressures of the larger society
3443526 i dont know if we can ever really hope to conquer foreign markets
3443527 but i think gothic lolita is the best example there is of the tokyo look we are really on the edge
3443528 datadoors for arcgis will give arcgis users the ability to acquire and store on a local machine useful data that will greatly aid them with their gis projects and analysis we are excited about offering this capability to our customers
3443529 as of april 1 2008 planned parenthood of nebraska and council bluffs ceased its relationship as a nebraska title x affiliate of nebraska health and human services at that time distribution of title x funds stopped and a complete close out of any previous title x relationship has since occurred
3443530 we are delighted to have been selected to host the 2013 u s womens open
3443531 we believe that the combination of the natural beauty and challenge of sebonack together with the worlds greatest female golfers will make for a lot of excitement in an area rich with a history of championship golf we are very proud to host a national championship
3443532 she is attending and there was some sort of clerical error in which somebody said she was hosting but she is not
3443533 why did she allow barack obama to quietly list her as co host of a washington fundraiser at a tony restaurant in august because she thought louisianans might not notice
3443534 senators especially those running for re election dont get listed as fundraising co hosts for presidential candidates by accident
3443535 i can assure you that it had nothing to do with a kennedy e mail about it
3443536 if they go ahead with their plan to construct that big building i will have to move out because i will not be able to do my job
3443537 the more i hear about how little thai laws and authorities support the general public the more i lose my faith in fairness in our country
3443538 chakrabhands place is precious mainly in terms of culture and arts
3443539 a large scale construction project means hundreds or thousands of people coming to live or work there with more cars more traffic more trash more air pollution and many other issues in the long term
3443540 maybe the most practical solution is that master chakrabhand finds a new plot of land somewhere away from the city in order to carry on work peacefully
3443541 i still believe in the existence of fairness somewhere in our society
3443542 this is a battle for not only for myself but also other people likely to suffer from large scale development projects
3443543 its a great moment of spontaneity and political manipulation all in one
3443544 bryan had a big opportunity but he missed it because he was afraid of losing his base

3443550 the goal is to get trucks off the communitys streets and roads and an untolled south fraser perimeter road will do that
3443551 i think probably to a degree the fact that its not tolled will help keep trucks out of neighbourhoods lets keep the trucks on the road thats being developed for them
3443552 the emphasis here is on commercial goods its going to provide connectivity between deltaport and major industrial areas in the lower mainland connectivity with the trans canada highway connectivity with highway 15 to the u s and of course its going to provide connectivity among those businesses that are along the route

3443556 over 70 of total global emissions are generated from cities and if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them this is a vital step for city councils who wish to gain a better understanding of their own impact and by improving their understanding of risks and opportunities associated with climate change best prepare their cities for a carbon constrained world
3443557 the city of new york joins the worlds leading corporations in providing a complete accurate accounting of its carbon emissions the strategies it is employing to mitigate those emissions and the results of its efforts through the carbon disclosure project and iclei this partnership between the worlds major corporations and increasingly its cities highlights the importance of the cooperative action needed to successfully counter climate change

3443566 you know i was thinking about how much god has done for me it really is amazing grace isnt it
3443567 and distributed half a million stickers with 3 eyes on them
3443568 why were these items taken when none of these items could be used as evidence of child neglect
3443569 jesus never sent anyone to a doctor or a hospital jesus offered healing by one means only healing was by faith
3443570 when we dont have faith we need the doctor and its obvious that most want to be christians need the doctors because they have no faith in god their faith is in man god created good and evil witchcraft can heal also should christians also seek witches
3443571 what this really is is an attempt by the government to make yet another attack on our religious belief in an effort to destroy our faith

3443578 you shall fear the lord thy god you shall serve him and to him you shall hold fast and take oaths in his name

3443584 perhaps you dont want to hear all the details about this subject
3443585 life planning is a place for you not to feel alone going it alone is not wise anyway one of the things i teach is that everybody i think needs a sounding board a sounding board is just some bodies doesnt have to be a professional for tens of thousands of years we have sat around the fire with elders to figure out where did we come from what are we doing here and where we are going if theres a drought what do we do during a drought or a problem so where are the fires sitting where are the elders today that is life planning
3443586 at best work seems never ending only because like life it is a pilgrimage a journey in which we progress not only through the world but through stages of understanding
3443587 did your actions today yield respect for your family were they a credit to your faith and a benefit to your fellow man
3443588 concerning the results of the friendlies weve played we could have done better but we also have to consider the teams weve played against and the level of their physical preparation
3443589 against inter and juventus the difference wasnt evident in fact we did better certainly we can improve our mental approach to the games
3443590 also we dont have our strikers available which makes it difficult to score against teams like chelsea and manchester city without strikers the play changes completely and you are always under pressure
3443591 with just paloschi available its not easy alberto is doing his job well he didnt go on vacation and he also has a thousand justifications even though he played two good matches
3443592 dario is a very nice lad we have won a lot and celebrated together but its normal that at his age with less playing time he wants to play
3443593 you know the antidote to exhuastion is not necessarily rest
3443594 theres nothing more annoying than food geeks taking photos of their plates of food and posting them on their blog
3443595 real foodies should just give over to the experience of eating and let the experience take them away no questions no expectations no analysis

3443599 just like skip we were fans of the team in the lean years in the 70s and the 80s
3443600 we tuned in to listen to the funny one liners

3443607 having strong affiliates is imperative to building the islanders future along with the utah grizzlies the jackalopes will help feed the organization with not only skilled hockey players but great human beings
3443608 i know first hand what kind of organization the new york islanders are
3443609 we are fortunate to be part of their family and are committed to helping them in any way possible
3443610 the odessa jackalopes are a top rate organization and were proud to have them as an affiliate
3443611 joe clark and his staff run a great program in texas and were looking forward to working with them
3443612 reece has been looking for other projects in which we can use the experience that we have gained by drilling extended reach multi stage fractured horizontal wells in our dodsland viking play
3443613 we believe that the lower shaunavon play in southwestern saskatchewan is similar to our existing dodsland viking play in that large quantities of oil can be unlocked through the use of multi stage fracturing in horizontal wells this new resource play located in saskatchewan augments our existing saskatchewan plays and complements our operational strengths in the area
3443614 vertical wells however are small producers and the true potential of the field lies in improving the production potential of both the upper and lower shaunavon formation through horizontal development
3443615 throughout this summer we have seen the promise of there being better weather but it hasnt ever really materialised
3443616 over the next few days its not looking too great we have had a few decent days this summer and the best we can expect is for a few more days here and there there doesnt seem to be any consistent or confident sense of seeing an extended spell of fine summer weather
3443617 a drivers level of risk is dramatically increased when roads are wet and it is raining heavily it is important that drivers remain alert and take extra precautions in order to make their journey as safe as possible
3443618 it is very easy to misjudge stopping distances in wet weather and this factor is responsible for low speed shunts in traffic jams and on slower speed limit roads
3443619 as soon as were able to get into the site and into those buildings well have our own engineers go in again to confirm whether or not they are in fact requiring to have these orders on them
3443620 hopefully some of those six can be deemed to be safe and allow the residents back in
3443621 anything thats not considered safe will be requiring an engineer to be hired by the owners of those properties to assess the buildings and provide us toronto building with a report identifying what is needed to make it safe
3443622 and those repairs would have to be completed before occupancy of those buildings would be permitted
3443623 when the senate reconvenes in september our first order of business should be to pass a common sense bipartisan energy plan that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil in light of this clear national priority senator reids new omnibus is particularly troubling because many of the bills i am holding would if enacted erect new barriers to domestic oil exploration
3443624 if senator reid wants to consider a multi billion omnibus bill after completing our work on energy i would urge him to do what every american family does and make choices between competing budget priorities the decision by both parties to not live within our means has jeopardized our nations economic and national security unfortunately senator reid hasnt responded to my offer to work with him to identify offsets like many politicians before him senator reid is treating the challenge of living within our means as not his problem but a problem for future generations and congresses
3443625 senator reid should drop from his second omnibus various disease specific earmarks that have been discredited by the director of the nih scientists not career politicians lobbyists or celebrity advocates should be making life of death decisions about which avenues of medical research are most promising
3443626 as you consider legislation affecting nih in the future i caution you that it would be a grave mistake to go backwards in mandating disease specific research at a time when barriers need to be torn down not rebuilt disease specific mandates while well intended might undermine the progress we have made
3443627 on this point i also take exception with senator reids suggestion that my concerns with his disease specific earmarks are not based on a sincere policy disagreement but callousness toward people in wheelchairs and people with lou gehrigs disease as well as victims of other diseases even though i have first hand experience treating more than 20 000 patients in my medical practice i have never suggested that any of my colleagues with non medical backgrounds are not capable of offering compassionate and constructive health care policy recommendations senator reids inability to extend that same courtesy speaks volumes about the senates failure to work together and solve problems
3443628 chupa my chupacabra i wanna reach out and grab ya
3443629 im not just a soldier who has been put in charge the museum an interest in industry and history has been in my dna since i was born
3443630 the museum is vitally important because it tells the story of all the contributions that manchester has made to the modern world we want to tell that story in the best way possible
3443631 our funding application has been sidelined but no way is it finished we will be exploring all options and arguing the case to everyone that a world class museum will reap huge rewards it will happen on my watch even if i have to stay here until im 80

3443658 en la sesi n celebrada el 29 de septiembre ltimo y por mayor a absoluta hay un acuerdo referente a fogueres infantiles que proh be sean stas expuestas durante los tres d as de fiestas del mes de junio por considerar que dichas fogueras no son nacidas de la inspiraci n infantil y s de personas que llevan la direcci n de las mismas sin responsabilidad para ello y con intenci n directa a entorpecer la recaudaci n de las fogueres oficiales que se ven enormemente despose das del mayor ingreso y a la vez boicoteadas por las que dirigen las infantiles aparte del mal gusto que en s van presentando algunas de las infantiles ya que llegan noticias hasta esta gestora de la constituci n de varias comisiones infantiles con tendencias pol ticas y ya llegado a este punto en correcto proceder para salir al paso de todas las infantiles que se presenten con ciertos caracteres de perjuicio moral y material para las fogueres oficiales

3443673 la importancia cada a o en aumento que tiene para nuestra capital la celebraci n de las fiestas de las fogueres de san chuan que con tanta brillantez han venido verific ndose en los ltimos a os ha llevado al nimo de esta presidencia la idea de que es preciso organizar con toda la antelaci n necesaria las del pr ximo a o a fin de que constituyan un verdadero acontecimiento de resonancia nacional y que el nombre de nuestras fogueres unido al de alicante repercuta por todos los mbitos de la pen nsula atrayendo en estos d as del mes de junio el mayor contingente posible de visitantes y turistas que pueden gozar de sus fiestas con beneficio incalculable para el comercio y la industria alicantina a tal fin se considera indispensable la constituci n de un comit oficial de festejos de alicante en el que bajo el patronato del excmo ayuntamiento se agrupen en primer lugar las personas que constituyen la mesa de la comisi n gestora de las fogueres de san chuan porque siendo eminentemente popular el origen y organizaci n de estas fiestas a ellos corresponde el haberles sabido encauzar y mantener en la forma que tan un nime elogio merece y juntamente con estos activos elementos representantes de algunos organismo oficiales

3443675 celebr ndose con relativa frecuencia bailes de sociedad en los diferentes distritos de la capital por las comisiones respectivas y neg ndose algunas de dichas comisiones al pago de los derechos que estas ejecuciones musicales deben tributar a la sgae a pesar de que los ingresos que produzcan estos bailes se destinen a fines ben ficos es por lo que me permito dirigirme a esa dign sima presidencia con el ruego de que haga saber a todas las comisiones de distrito las obligaciones que tienen de abonar estos derechos que por otra parte esta representaci n procurar amoldarlos a la modestia de sus organizaciones pensando siempre en los altos fines que se persiguen dignos en todo momento de nuestro aplauso y de nuestro entusiasmo m s encendido
3443676 it is time to start looking after myself and my family
3443677 my departure and seclusion in najaf is my response to all the mistakes we have made in the mahdi army
3443678 we fought for 50 days and in the end iraqi soldiers came and violated the sanctity of our homes
3443679 i will not join those cells even if i am personally asked to do so
3443680 but najaf can wait to fight the occupier with the imam mahdi army is holy work too
3443681 i will have to make do with very little in najaf but thats ok
3443682 but i must find a way to provide for my family
3443683 shareholder activism can raise the stock price of a particular company to benefit particular shareholders in the short run but it lowers the value of the stock market as a whole for average investors in the long run
3443684 one favorite hedge fund tactic is to urge the outright sale of the company they have a position in as mr icahn did in the case of yahoo while the shareholders of an acquired company typically receive a premium in a sale the shareholders of the acquirer often lose when the acquirers stock declines
3443685 a second hedge fund strategy is to demand massive dividend or share repurchase programs temporarily raising share prices by draining
3443686 shareholder activism hurts average investors by making managers more reluctant to operate as public companies a common outcome is to see the target company sold to a private equity firm as a result average public shareholders are finding fewer public companies to invest in this may explain why private equity funds able to snap up well performing companies whose managers are tired of dealing with activists
3443687 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3443688 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3443689 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution
3443690 take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
3443691 ignores the massive biblical foundation of his teaching on spiritual formation
3443692 bases his entire spiritual disciplines book on his understanding of matthew 11 29 30
3443693 pauls teaching especially when added to his practices strongly suggest that he understood and practiced something vital about the christian life that we have lost and that we must do our best to recover
3443694 for further discussion of the matters discussed in this article see my the spirit of the disciplines
3443695 respect for willards calling to minister to students in secular universities
3443696 then for some reason the web site finds fault with willards belief that jesus calls the lost to be disciples thats kind of a big thing in the gospels
3443697 to make willard sound like he is opposed to the atonement
3443698 simply wants the western church to consider all of the different ways that the atonement is explained in the new testament not just the substitutionary model
3443699 the evil that we do in our present condition is a reflection of a weakness caused by spiritual starvation
3443700 if the missing element in the present human order is that of the spirit what then is spirit very simply spirit is unembodied personal power

3443704 john mccain standing to benefit and barack obama facing a more perilous situation
3443705 he has looked into putins eyes and seen a k a g and a b
3443706 so there really might be a connection between the high level visit of the former prisoner of war john mccain himself and the release now of three american prisoners here in southern colombia
3443707 meanwhile mccain goes to colombia and a bunch of hostages are freed from a terrorist group in a daring raid read into that what you will
3443708 and they ve gone down in part because the market is realizing that this kind of pressure from the congress may actually cause a change in american policy
3443709 my friends all americans most americans want us to drill and by the way when the president announced he was lifting the federal moratorium the price of a barrel of oil went down
3443710 today for the first time in our history as a nation we are being presented with a characteristic range of human behaviors such as fasting meditation simple living and submission to a spiritual overseer in an attractive light
3443711 like a child exploring the attic of an old house on a rainy day discovering a trunk full of treasure and then calling all his brothers and sisters to share the find richard j foster has found the spiritual disciplines that the modern world stored away and forgot and has excitedly called us to celebrate them for they are as he shows us the instruments of joy the way into mature christian spirituality and abundant life
3443712 they can only get us to the place where something can be done
3443713 p erhaps the best known quaker in the world today
3443714 because we bid people tremble at the word of god
3443715 likely that the name originally derisive was also used because many early friends like other religious enthusiasts themselves trembled i e quaked in their religious meetings and showed other physical manifestations of religious emotion
3443716 stresses a almost mystical knowledge of god and the workings of the lords within all people
3443717 lord is there more you want to bring into my life i want to be conquered and ruled by you if there is anything blocking the flow of your power reveal it to me

3443725 when youre out socializing with another couple you dont have to work so hard to keep the conversation going
3443726 if other people are around you and your partner will be less liable to bring up serious issues that might sour the evening
3443727 that can really reinforce your marital bond especially if you share stories about happy times
3443728 a husband and wife often get into the rut of having the same conversations over and over about kids in laws whatever
3443729 socializing with another couple changes that tune and gets you talking about topics that arent run of the mill for you
3443730 when its just the two of you you might let your looks slide and just wear something comfortable
3443731 but if youre meeting another couple youll put extra effort into looking good and that can spice up your marriage
3443732 if you always go out with another couple you might get lost in the foursome
3443733 in other words you could get so caught up in social interaction that you lose sight of the we if that happens your intimacy may suffer its all about finding a balance while its great to go out with another couple occasionally double dating shouldnt be your standard night out it should be an accent not your steady diet you need quality time to yourselves
3443734 when you write a column like that the majority of people will assume thats how all women behave in the locker room and it just provides ammunition for them to say we shouldnt be there in the first place i also disagreed with you about erins outfit which was appropriate for tv
3443735 you are such a loser you really suck or are gay or both
3443736 preocupa m s que nada porque hab a una expectativa despu s del primer partido se nos escap el partido ante cruz azul y de visitante est dentro de los planes una derrota pero no como sucedi el s bado
3443737 hubo dos goles a pelota parada desatenciones defensivas errores que de alguna manera se pagan muy caro principalmente en la cuesti n de la atenci n creo que tigres no fue muy superior a atlas el partido fue muy chato en el primer tiempo y en el segundo ellos encontraron el primer gol y ya el segundo y tercer gol fueron desatenciones de nosotros
3443738 lo de mend vil no es importante es una cuesti n muy leve que con un poco de recuperaci n y tratamiento el d a s bado no tendr inconvenientes gonzalo vargas est mejorando favorablemente pero no sabemos si estar el s bado aunque l tiene muchas ganas de regresar y botinelli estar listo despu s de la expulsi n as que la nica baja podr a ser la de mauricio romero y con vargas esperaremos hasta el ltimo momento
3443739 eso no tiene nada qu ver su ausencia porque tampoco estuve contra chivas y sacaron un excelente resultado as que son circunstancias que hay en cada partido y hay que trabajar bien para estar a punto para el pr ximo juego
3443740 son jugadas que pasan en cada partido eso ya qued atr s hay que pensar en lo que viene estar concientes de lo que nos jugamos en el pr ximo juego porque son tres puntos muy importantes
3443741 yo al equipo lo sigo viendo muy s lido cruz azul es un gran equipo hay que reconocerlo por ah se encontraron con algunas circunstancias en pelota parada pero el equipo nunca entreg el partido hay que estar al pendiente y estar al cien por ciento toda esta semana porque el tema porcentual se complic nuevamente
3443742 hay presi n pero hay un equipo muy responsable en ese sentido dejamos atr s una doble victoria que nos dio ox geno puro ahora se complic bastante porque se combinaron resultados que no nos favorecieron y estamos nuevamente con esa situaci n no hay presi n extra y todo est como arrancamos tenemos confianza en el equipo
3443743 creo que hay un desorden y no porque nos hagan goles este equipo entra en excesos de confianza y lo digo por experiencia propia el s bado me exced en una jugada de exceso de confianza por fortuna no me quitaron la pelota pero eso puede cambiar el rumbo de los partidos y creo que eso son detallitos por fortuna no pas nada pero yo hago el an lisis y creo que este equipo mientras no caiga en exceso de confianza y sea serio que sabe a lo que juega y al l mite creo que tendremos un buen torneo
3443744 s cuando hay opci n tampoco soy un dechado de t cnica pero el mejor portero del mundo no sale jugando con los pies ni hace la faceta de un jugador por ah te la dan y tienes criterio para jugarla o tirarla arriba o t ve a saber pero lo que pas el s bado fue un exceso de confianza que por suerte me sali bien pero sino la historia hubiera cambiado totalmente
3443745 creo que vamos a hablar de algo importante que es la continuidad si te das cuenta el equipo sigue igual hay una o dos incrustaciones la base est la forma de jugar sigue seguimos con esa mec nica y hasta ahorita somos un equipo s lido muy dif cil y hoy los puntos nos han acompa ado
3443746 el inicio no es nada f cil el inicio siempre es dif cil porque es una incertidumbre muchas veces traes muchas ganas muchos deseos pero si no llegan los resultados hay veces que te desesperas hoy por fortuna llevamos cuatro partidos y hemos llevado los cuatro duelos de buena manera y hemos sacado el primer partido con muchos ri ones y los otros hemos manejado los partidos y los tiempos pero si te digo que no ha sido nada f cil hoy te puedo decir que esto apenas empieza y no nos da ni para echar las campanas al vuelo ni para subirse a un ladrillo y marearse va empezando y ya sabemos que se dice que no importa como empieza sino como terminas
3443747 un equipo crece y se hace s lido con base en sus jugadores hoy el nivel de ellos braulio y jagger
3443748 obviamente es muy bueno peor tambi n para esto nos preparamos y nada lo tomamos con tranquilidad sabiendo que tenemos que trabajar de la misma manera creo yo que el futbol mexicano es muy parejo pero bueno son equipos que han hecho bien las cosas en los ltimos tiempos pachuca y cruz azul y se nos dieron bien las cosas a costa de hacer buenos partidos y somos conscientes que tenemos que seguir de la misma manera no aflojar y creo que para cualquier jugador e instituci n es lindo estar all arriba
3443749 sabemos qu es lo que nos viene dando los resultados y nosotros queremos mejorar y queremos mejorar individualmente y obviamente que eso habla bien del conjunto y tenemos muchas ganas de seguir arriba porque es lindo
3443750 lo tuve de compa ero al pollo pero no s lo por dar o tienen buenos jugadores y tomaremos los recaudos necesarios pero la premisa es ver qu podemos generar nosotros y a partir de ah plantear los partidos
3443751 lo realizado hasta el momento es gracias a lo que todos los jugadores han puesto de su parte no nada m s lo necesario sino m s del cien por ciento hicimos una pretemporada muy completa en el aspecto f sico que si bien tuvimos pocos partidos de preparaci n les tratamos de sacar el mayor provecho posible
3443752 nos mentalizamos dijimos que en el torneo no pod amos relajarnos porque nosotros como equipo necesitamos trabajar los partidos somos un equipo que en ese aspecto estamos trabajando a conciencia
3443753 yo por lo pronto estoy trabajando conmigo mismo me gusta seguir trabajando cosas dentro y fuera de la cancha lo cual trato de plasmarlo con mis compa eros siempre trato de trabajar bien de aprovechar el tiempo todo el trabajo que se realiza debe estar siempre de la mano de tu entrenador de tu preparador f sico y se han combinado factores para que el equipo ande bien y tambi n yo
3443754 todo lo que estamos logrando es gracias a la continuidad la verdad es que este equipo ha crecido mucha gente no se fija en eso pero esto es reflejo de a o y medio de trabajo es el ejemplo m s claro de lo que ha sido san luis en los ltimos a os

3443756 you are directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate
3443757 i think that one of the reasons i got this letter was to intimidate me
3443758 it sounded very totalitarian i thought it sounded undemocratic and i was completely shocked
3443759 having conversations on the pros and cons of those candidates i dont think this is an unusual thing at all in the democratic party
3443760 anytime we receive a complaint we are required by our rules to hear that complaint and decide whether or not it should be taken to the rules committee
3443761 if someone brings you private correspondence youll use that in investigating a complaint
3443762 we have used documents memos other things in the past where complaints have been filed we have used whatever comes to us that does not mean it goes to the rules committee
3443763 i do think there are some delegates on both sides with some wounded feelings because this has been a very difficult hard fought campaign
3443764 from our point its over with shes chosen not to come in and talk with us and so were two weeks away from the convention and well continue to work with the delegates who want to be worked with
3443765 i think that it was calculated to have an impact on other delegates and i think this kind of communication does have a very chilling impact on other delegates because people become afraid to speak up they become afraid to say what they think
3443766 you cant get unity by telling people to shut up
3443767 sadc free trade area for growth development and wealth creation

3443785 im so sorry i totally forgot that cpac is across the street today
3443786 what i really strove to do with this book is to get womens voices into islamic history
3443787 i was thinking about aisha and her strengths id read about what a strong witty influential leader she was
3443788 shes got the world debating a book no one has even read
3443789 if i do have threats of violence shes done it by alerting the muslims by calling it soft core porn by saying it made fun of islam
3443790 we understand the book is not historical documentation but it still uses the real characters of aisha and muhammad
3443791 it would be very tough to convince religious people that the novel isnt pretending to be the correct history
3443792 when combined with falsification of the islamic past it exploits americans who know nothing about aisha or her seventh century world and counts on stirring up controversy to increase sales
3443793 there was a significant inverse relationship between the amount of prescribed chemotherapy that was administered and the risk of relapse
3443794 were alarmed that one of our products was used in what appears to have been a deliberate scheme to adulterate a life saving medication and that people have suffered as a result

3443814 in one embodiment of the present invention windows comprise frames that are created by an operating system and content areas that are created by an application program
3443815 key signals are patterns of colored pixel picture element pairs
3443816 the key signal color coding scheme preferably uses the remaining primary color channel in the existing video interface as a video clock signal
3443817 key signal information includes start and stop sequences code sequences to distinguish a key signal from other display data horizontal and vertical offset values and a crc checksum the horizontal and vertical position of the key signal and the horizontal and vertical offset values can be summed by the window decoder to yield the coordinates of the portion of the content area to be specially processed the window decoder uses the other sequences in a variety of means for verifying the presence of a window intended to be specially processed accidental special processing could be very distracting to the user and should be avoided for example key signals preferably identifying upper left and lower right corners of the portion of the content area to be specially processed should be detected in one scan and should persist for a set number of scans similarly code sequences should match a pair of preset sequences and three bits of unchanging color as in a gray frame should be present prior to the start sequence of each key signal many other conditions used to avoid accidental special processing are described in the detailed description of the present invention once the window decoder enables special processing the window decoder disables special processing only when no special windows exist or when the special window is occluded by another window the present invention therefore handles special windows in a display enabling more effective presentation of visual information

3443913 what we want to do is get more value on the same planted area because more and more the cost of the land is getting higher
3443914 the alternative is going to new frontiers to make new mills and cane but to do that you need more infrastructure costs so the best alternative is to maximize the amount of product you get out of the same planted area

3443916 youre providing confidence in the marketplace that a market will be there giving companies today investing hundreds of millions into this research the firm footing that they need to move forward
3443917 timber corn soy cane switchgrass manure and wastes from it all even cracked rice a secondary product for animal feed could be used
3443918 this familys now in its eighth generation of cane farming
3443919 the biggest thing we need is good weather new varieties to grow better and a fair price for our product
3443920 the company wasnt reacting to media pressure and wasn t hiding louisiana mulch in a florida bag
3443921 we find it rather interesting they re selling florida gold which gives the indication it comes from florida
3443922 were concerned that at that plant theyre using whole trees its not a byproduct of other logging and our forests are being clearcut for a temporary mulch product
3443923 when they cut the cypress out all you have left is the trash trees
3443924 in forestry the areas we operate in 99 percent of the time are those class 1 and 2 areas that will regenerate
3443925 regrowth doesnt necessarily come back in the same trees you cut but mother nature isnt perfect
3443926 the cypress mulching industry reminds you there is no bottom to the wellspring of bad ideas
3443927 i believe very strongly that if an independent candidate and rogue like myself were to get into the presidents race legitimately and the polls looked like he had a chance to win that candidate would either be physically assassinated or would be assassinated credibility wise or in some manner by our government because i do not believe they would ever allow a true independent or a citizen to become president of the united states
3443928 he would probably not last long a black man in the position of president they would kill him he would probably not last long a black man in the position of president they would kill him
3443929 suggesting obama is in danger if he wins the election in november is not only divisive it is insulting to the american people
3443930 for many black supporters there is a lot of anxiety that he will be killed
3443931 sometimes agents of change end up being targets doesnt it make you at all fearful
3443932 is this pure spin from karl rove i mean could any sane observer see this as true
3443933 that mr mccain is one of the most private individuals to run for president in history
3443934 is that most times the people charged with doing the cleaning are also the same people in need of cleansing
3443935 what does this say for the average person on the street if we want them to co operate
3443936 how can we say to the ordinary citizen that you should report crimes tell the government what you know when the people who ran the department of justice thumb their noses at the system
3443937 schlozman was reshaping the civil rights division schlozman didnt know anything about voting law all he knew is he wanted to be sure that the republicans were going to win
3443938 unsubstantiated or false claims by the loser of a close race mischief and administrative or voter error
3443939 there is virtually no evidence that voter fraud ever occurs except by individuals and in rare instances
3443940 broke with established department policy by getting involved with contentious and partisan litigation on the eve of the election mr von spakovsky drafted legal briefs between the republican and democratic parties in three battleground states ohio michigan and florida just before the election all in favor of the republican partys position
3443941 these briefs ran counter to the well established practice of the civil rights division not to inject itself into litigation or election monitoring on the eve of an election where it would be viewed as expressing a political preference or could have an impact on a political dispute
3443942 they cooked up that there is a general exception to the policy because they wanted to prevent more fraud but indicting people before the election was not going to change anything registration had already closed there just wasnt a justification for bending the law
3443943 federal prosecutors and investigators should be extremely careful not to conduct overt investigations during the pre election period or while the elections are underway
3443944 a criminal investigation by armed badged federal agents runs the obvious risk of chilling legitimate voting and campaign activities
3443945 nowhere on the continent is this as important today as in russia where president vladimir putin rules as an autocrat
3443946 the biodiesel in louisiana has taken off like wildfire with all our farmers and loggers and fortunately in america
3443947 most of our personal cars are gas and in the u s maybe 10 to 15 percent of light vehicles on the road are diesel
3443948 in europe its more like 40 percent mostly volkswagens biodiesel is a more superior product to ethanol
3443949 from a logistics standpoint our position has been for this to go mainstream it has to integrate into the oil and gas infrastructure
3443950 louisiana has that it has the agriculture it has the vegetable oil infrastructure so we think its one of the prime areas of the country
3443951 there isnt one other spot on the whole planet that has put all of this together in such a synergistic fashion biodiesel is just a slice of the whole
3443952 no more soy will need to go out of this town for export itll all be recycled locally into the meat industry
3443953 its not smart now you got to be stupid to make biodiesel from soybean oil
3443954 we believe were only in the infancy stage of sales
3443955 worldwide i dont think weve reached 25 percent mechanization so theres tremendous opportunity for growth a lot of that will be due to ethanol
3443956 probably australia argentina bolivia columbia are most advanced right now
3443957 australia is 100 percent mechanized have been since the late 1970s only the u s is also fully mechanized
3443958 the u s is much more efficient than us more advanced in technology
3443959 in brazil we still do about 90 percent hand planting weve got to change our heads brazil planting is less efficient than planting here but in brazil they spend less money too
3443960 so when i went to brazil in may i brought three to four pounds of sugar back from home
3443961 in the last five years people have been asking more for it
3443962 here in lafayette weve got a lot of oilfield people who travel the world and to south america this is one of the things they get exposed to there
3443963 i have to find a reliable distributor there its a difficult thing someone who knows how to promote brazil and preach the love of cacha a
3443964 that one indeed is a man who today dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race
3443965 to one who visited in haifa said substantially in likening the cause of god to a garden at the gate of the garden some stand and look within but do not care to enter others step inside behold its beauty but do not penetrate far still others encircle this garden inhaling the fragrance of the flowers having enjoyed its full beauty pass out again by the same gate but there are always some who enter and becoming intoxicated with the splendor of what they behold remain for life to tend the garden
3443966 while the details of the incidents are still emerging we want to make it clear that unity takes this matter very seriously
3443967 the two individuals concerned have been suspended pending a full investigation we do not wish to comment further since to do so would prejudice the investigation
3443968 some people were walking past and just noticed them at it it was irrelevant that the glass was frosted you could see two figures undressing each other before getting very close
3443969 there was nothing left to the imagination and it was clear what was going on
3443970 there were a number of us there who saw them including taxi driver and police community support officers
3443971 in all there was a crowd of between 15 and 20 people out there
3443972 the couple must have been having sex for about 20 minutes there were people cheering and whooping yet they seemed not to notice obviously they had other things on their mind
3443973 one of the police community support workers who had sen what was going on then went inside to let them know they were being observed
3443974 i dont know whether they were given the message but not too long after they stopped
3443975 i personally thought it was funny they were both naked
3443976 we expect unity staff to share the same values and code of conduct as council colleagues and so are very concerned about these allegations
3443977 however we are satisfied that unity is following the right procedures in dealing with this and that it will take appropriate disciplinary action if the allegations prove to be correct
3443978 were not saying diablo 3 is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close
3443979 this change wont impact the game were really pleased with
3443980 were looking at all aspects of this these are elderly women so there may be a connection there
3443981 hilfe meine eltern verstehen nicht was ich beruflich mache fragen mich aber immer wieder

3443986 that this could occur in america today these ice agents swooped into town armed with everything but search warrants and started rounding up people citizens and non citizens alike merely because they had brown skin imagine the fallout if this had happened to white people

3443994 criminally charged with aggravated identity theft and social security fraud charges they did not understand
3443995 their children were traumatized by the sudden disappearance of so many of their friends
3443996 for children it was as if ten of their classmates suddenly died
3443997 poorly disguised beneath an empty rhetoric of misguided patriotism as well as insults to anyone showing compassion safely hidden behind cowardly nickname s one could feel the moral fabric of society coming apart
3443998 blindsided into an assignment he wanted no part of in all his years as a court interpreter he was assigned to criminal cases involving rape murder mayhem narcotics human trafficking and terrorism
3443999 throughout the day the procession continued ten by ten hour after hour the same charges the same recitation from the magistrates the same faces chains and shackles on the defendants
3444000 was about to bear the brunt of his conflict of interest
3444001 i walked for a month and ten days until i crossed the river
3444002 i just wanted to work a year or two save and then go back to my family but it was not to be
3444003 if you want to see your children or dont want your family to starve sign here
3444004 not at all that was our impartial and probably unanimous judgment we saw attorneys hold back tears and weep alongside their clients we saw judges prosecutors clerks and marshals do their duty sometimes with a heavy heart but always with a particular solemnity not accorded to the common criminals theyre used to encountering
3444005 your honor i am concerned from my attorney client interviews that many of these people are clearly not guilty yet they have no choice but to plead out
3444006 you know i dont agree with any of this or with the way it is being done in fact i ruled in a previous case that to charge somebody with identity theft the person had to at least know of the real owner of the social security number
3444007 as a citizen i want our judges to administer justice not a federal agency when the executive branch forces the hand of the judiciary the result is abuse of power and arbitrariness unworthy of a democracy founded upon the constitutional principle of checks and balances
3444008 knowingly ly us ing a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit any unlawful activity or felony

3444016 resorting to the theater of the absurd another gimmick for having failed to achieve systematic immigration reform in congress
3444017 reports of deaths and abuse in detention limited or no access to health care and prescribed medications and the hodge podge of for profit and government run state and local prisons where ice detainees are assigned
3444018 we are not going to deport our way our of our immigration mess nor is it likely most or many of the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants
3444019 first and largest national collaboration and advocate of 2000 ethnic news organizations
3444020 rush to prosecute leaves immigrant victims of crimes without protection
3444021 didnt allow them to use restrooms during 10 hour shifts
3444022 few employers face civil and criminal sanctions for violating immigration and labor laws
3444023 ice and federal prosecutors overstepped their powers by criminally charg ing workers
3444024 to engage in otherwise lawful conduct such as to procure jobs
3444025 unable to work or feed their families as theyre in jail or awaiting deportation orders that could take months

3444028 the june 23 action though small underscores how raw nerves remain and also punctuates the fragility of the towns transition to normalcy
3444029 a guatemalan handyman who worked for a local property owner
3444030 about a thousand protesters descended on postville today decrying the may 12 raid and calling for a change in federal immigration policies
3444031 the criminalization of people who come to the us simply to make a living
3444032 and have asked the attorney general to bring criminal charges against the company for child labor violations for egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
3444033 prohibited occupations exposing them to hazardous chemicals making them work with prohibited tools like knives and saws
3444034 immigrants and activists are beginning to organize protests and high visibility responses
3444035 laws are like cobwebs which may catch small flies but let wasps and hornets break through
3444036 this happened because we started to eat better food like eating more meat
3444037 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging
3444038 the retail sale lease licensing or use of specified digital products transferred to or accessed by subscribers or consumers
3444039 sales of digital audio works music digital audiovisual works movies music videos tv shows and digital books
3444040 most of the proponents of the nexus legislation would concede that given this is an election year its unlikely the legislation will pass
3444041 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3444042 the sale of digital music delivered electronically to customers for download on their computers constitutes the sale of intangible property and is not subject to sales or use tax
3444043 the product transition referred to in apples recent conference call was referring to quicktime encoding decoding chips built into their products
3444044 a quicktime encoding decoding chip would handle the grunt work of processing video presumably in the h 264 format so that mac computers processors wouldnt have to do as much heavy lifting
3444045 more and more you see people connecting their laptops to their hdtv sets and that really raises the bar for video processing
3444046 but they also want to interact with the video and its important to free up the cpu to handle those other applications
3444047 being an entrepreneur is not about the idea its about the execution
3444048 its not about the strategy its about executing the strategy
3444049 work colleagues put more into a deal than our own friends and family
3444050 they understand what youre pitching and have more faith in you in a business context also often the people we work with especially among more disposable assets than some of our family members friends and neighbors
3444051 the first two elements of the business model are the most important questions an entrepreneur can answer what are you selling and who are you selling it to and why does anybody care thats your elevator pitch
3444052 the idea is not just to answer the questions in the model but to use the answers early on in your evolution to dictate the actions you take
3444053 the outcome of the first stage is a business plan and hopefully seed funding
3444054 we exit the proof of concept stage when weve proven feasibility we can do what we say we can do and salability that someone will buy it its critical to think about proving the business entrepreneurs think of proof of concept as feasibility only but you also have to prove there is a market that will actually pay for your product
3444055 my glory the ocean of my loving kindness the sun of my bounty the heaven of my mercy rest upon thee we pray god to illumine the world through thy knowledge and wisdom to ordain for thee that which will gladden thine heart and impart consolation to thine eyes
3444056 and upon whosoever serveth thee and circleth around thee woe great woe betide him that opposeth and injureth thee well is it with him that sweareth fealty to thee the fire of hell torment him who is thine enemy
3444057 a shield unto all who are in heaven and on earth a stronghold for whosoever hath believed in god the incomparable the all knowing god grant that through thee he may protect them may enrich and sustain them that he may inspire thee with that which shall be a wellspring of wealth unto all created things an ocean of bounty unto all men and the dayspring of mercy unto all peoples
3444058 quench it not with the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny the purpose of justice is the appearance of unity among men
3444059 can compare with that of justice the organization of the world and the tranquillity of mankind depend upon it
3444060 now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with

3444079 interesting study but misleading in that it leaves out local social networks for example the most used social network in japan is mixi which isnt covered by this survey
3444080 there are so many hi tech companies there with ties to the usa that im sure this is indicative of the networking going on between it folks in both countries
3444081 le monde published an interesting map of each regions favourite social networking site a while ago its good to see you continuing the search but you might find the list of sites you chose is quite us centric
3444082 using google insights with the networks mentioned on the map we see that the japanese love mixi south koreans love cyworld so there is some difference of opinion between the two sources

3444094 business governments and people depend on the internet for such a large number of their activities today we must prioritize the secure and stable functioning of the internet ensuring there are appropriate policy legal and regulatory frameworks is essential to preventing economic loss and disruption of peoples
3444095 it takes adherence to good practices it takes the experience of all stakeholders to develop and implement policies and frameworks that are put in place nationally it must be a collaborative effort on policy and in practice
3444096 theres reason to say lets do this thing together so that we can complement each other
3444097 we need to find out who is doing what and integrate our efforts to lower the cost and speed up the process
3444098 when you speak of infrastructure you dont create infrastructure industry by industry you create infrastructure to be used by all of them

3444102 if we think these changes will significantly improve the buyer experience we may expand them to additional segments of sellers or categories
3444103 in a small percentage of cases where it has been determined the risk of dissatisfied buyers is higher paypal may delay release of the payment funds to the seller until the buyer has left a positive feedback or 21 days have passed without a dispute claim chargeback or reversal filed on that transaction

3444110 one might imagine with developments like the euro and the growth of world wide networks like visa and mastercard that the number of different forms of many and ways of making payment will become rationally reduced into a small set of preferred standards
3444111 well its certainly filling up many peoples wallets with all sorts of plastic and paper payment and membership cards id invite readers to look through their own wallets and count the number of different kinds of cards and credentials theyre carrying and why i think future digital wallet interfaces could help people manage and access of all the different forms of money and types of payment that they currently carry in daily life and will for the forseeable future and its certainly frustrating to feel compelled to carry multiple forms of payment technology in order to meet the dictates of different service providers to use tokyo again as an example different convenient stores currently require different non transferrable varieties of digital cash which made some of the people we talked to question the usefulness of digital cash entirely but i also want to acknowledge that a certain level of complexity can be desirable and even delightful efficiency isnt necessarily the most important value underlying peoples monetary behavior and choices people often like to have multiple bank or card accounts for example to assign each with a different use and meaning and perhaps to keep some private from their spouse or significant other and some of the people we interviewed were a bit proud to show off the schemes they had developed to link together multiple forms of payments so that they could get double or triple points for a single purchase learning about and dealing with the complexity of money systems can become a kind of game or at least be a bit playful theres quite a bit of research in behavioral and sociological economics showing that people are quite good at designing their own ideosyncratic schemes for making sense of the multiple pots and flows of money around them
3444112 cultures certainly vary quite a bit in how money is popularly understood and how safe people feel in taking a chance on some newfangled payment investment or transfer scheme

3444143 my departure and seclusion in najaf is my response to all the mistakes we have made in the mahdi army
3444144 we fought for 50 days and in the end iraqi soldiers came and violated the sanctity of our homes
3444145 i will not join those cells even if i am personally asked to do so
3444146 but najaf can wait to fight the occupier with the imam mahdi army is holy work too
3444147 i will have to make do with very little in najaf but thats ok
3444148 but i must find a way to provide for my family
3444149 these iraqi soldiers you see on sadr city streets will beat a fast retreat if al sadr orders us to fight them
3444150 they will desert if they miss a single paycheck their victory is fragile
3444151 new apartments going up along the south corridor light rail line it will be the citys first affordable transit oriented rental housing developers say
3444152 the big thing is that you need to make sure the folks who use transit can get to it

3444180 in religion and politics peoples beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second hand and without examination from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second hand from other non examiners whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing
3444181 it is as if you are a female in a male body
3444182 i am a female consciousness performing male tasks and living the male role

3444196 its time to put a stop to all the crime you cant sleep at night because people are shooting and you want to know where the bullet is going to go next
3444197 to curtail some of the general mayhem weve been experiencing particularly the gun shots
3444198 nobody can walk down the street and be safe that is be free from police interference
3444199 they know exactly whos doing the shooting the robbery but it seems like were never going to get any justice around here
3444200 we got kids down here they should lock up these young folks that have been doing the shooting dont put us hostage or on lockdown
3444201 weve taken some drugs off people a couple of guns off people
3444202 go find something else so skee stops being a bitch

3444206 a very common question that women who are five year breast cancer survivors ask us as oncologists is what is my risk of recurrence of breast cancer now and thats a number that weve had a hard time coming up with
3444207 i actually think that patients think that the risk is a lot higher than it is so i hope that this paper somewhat reassures them that their risk of recurrence after they are five year survivors is probably not as high as they think it is
3444208 that was certainly a finding that we were surprised to see
3444209 it is a real coup for us and the city to get the one of the best fighters in the world with the added bonus of his friend frank

3444214 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3444215 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3444216 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3444217 i encountered one such woman recently she came to me quite upset because windows xp on her computer had become corrupted somehow and a technician re installed it for her but she was missing several years worth of pictures of her child when he was a baby shed never run a single backup in four years and despite my efforts using undelete software i was only able to recover a fraction of the photos shed lost it was heartbreaking to have to tell her that several years worth of photos were lost forever

3444228 linde to host hydrogen ride amp drive event at liberty science center
3444229 as a new jersey company that employs over 600 people in the state linde is pleased to sponsor this local event we hope it will raise awareness of the need to develop alternative energy technologies to promote a cleaner environment for new jersey residents and for the entire country
3444230 linde is an expert in designing and delivering hydrogen refueling technology we have equipped more public hydrogen refuelling stations than any other company over 70 stations in 15 countries we also have performed over 120 000 hydrogen vehicle refuellings the most of any hydrogen supplier we believe our participation in this tour will prove that its practical for average citizens to drive hydrogen cars and refuel easily
3444231 this experience combined with our global size and scale enables us to execute projects safely and successfully it also gives us the expertise to deliver new and sustainable energy solutions that contribute to a greener world and cleaner environment

3444234 typically at that point management sees no way to improve the business within a reasonable period of time to allow it to go forward
3444235 i went from making a lot of money on a shift to making very little
3444236 while we do see growth rates coming down in new york and london and among our largest accounts we have more than made up for that
3444237 in markets we are benefiting from leading positions serving customers in foreign exchange commodities energy corporate and emerging markets which have more than offset weakness among our global investment banking clients
3444238 we are encouraged by the robust revenue growth which we achieved despite the backdrop of a challenging economic environment
3444239 its like the old soviet days they were making an example of us for ukraine and others to see
3444240 what we need is to get out of a crisis i just want to push people to dialogue
3444241 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3444242 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very considerable losses
3444243 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3444244 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3444245 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
3444246 schools hospital houses all infrastructure is ruined theres no water no electricity we will rebuild it
3444247 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3444248 no plans to force anyone from power this is not in our political culture at all
3444249 ive spotted an excellent opportunity to cash in on the turnaround of one of americas most visible companies jim stanton
3444250 ive had my eye on a number of retail stocks for some time now looking for signs of a potential turnaround and starbucks is now high on my list
3444251 one of the main reasons for the slide in sbux shares from its high of 40 in november 2006 was the overly aggressive expansion plan
3444252 and as food and dairy prices have soared this has led to higher operating costs in turn this forced starbucks to raise prices just as consumers were struggling from the housing slump and soaring inflation
3444253 and as competition from the likes of mcdonalds and dunkin donuts has turned up the heat starbucks has suffered charges related to closing out unprofitable stores but starbucks is tackling the problems
3444254 declining sales along with its falling stock price have hit starbucks like a double shot of espresso at 7 00 am so the firm has gone back to basics launching its revival from the top
3444255 starbucks has re hired the man responsible for the companys success ceo howard schultz having served as ceo from 1987 to 2000 schultz helped starbucks grow from 100 coffee shops to 15 756 stores today
3444256 his knowledge and experience should help greatly in turning starbucks around he wants to return to the companys roots the coffee the consumer and the starbucks experience more specifically schultz plans to reform starbucks in the following ways
3444257 i like what i hear about starbucks transformation but in the current environment the key to boosting business is pricing people are willing to pay for the starbucks experience as long as the price is within reason
3444258 schultzs strategy of soft pedaling growth in mature markets while investing more heavily overseas reminds me of the mcdonalds plan in the early 2000s it worked too its share price has more than quadrupled since 2003
3444259 and schultzs return has attracted some much bigger customers too
3444260 typically he pressures companies to focus on their core businesses and dump less profitable ventures he will reinforce starbucks raison detre a coffee house do coffee and do it well and people will return
3444261 the return of schultz and his rebuilding plan along with investments by peltz and ainslie has had a positive effect on sbux shares over the last month
3444262 down from its november 2006 all time high of 40 a definitive close above 18 52 would now indicate a positive change in trend
3444263 is there a reason why they are not on their normal migration
3444264 we dont know and we depend on the horses to keep down the fire fuels in virginia city and the virginia city highlands
3444265 im worried because there is a reason why the horses natural migration isnt happening
3444266 they are the laying est down horses ive ever seen
3444267 you cant get there without a key to the gate of tric
3444268 ive seen a few real skinny ones but i think they were probably just old
3444269 were up in the air were not right next to them so its hard to give an evaluation
3444270 they look like they were moving pretty good so thats a good sign

3444303 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
3444304 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3444305 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
3444306 the campaign has also undercut mccains image as a straight talker by dramatically limiting the national medias access to the candidate who once charmed reporters and voters alike with his easy free wheeling common man conversational style on his campaign bus
3444307 he can point to areas where he broke with the bush administration where he broke with his own party
3444308 around 2005 or so he realized he was running for president and he made a calculated decision he was going to do whatever was necessary to win this office
3444309 so many republicans just hate him because he doesnt play ball thats the definition of what a maverick is
3444310 it was absolute excitement shock in the utmost of wattage
3444311 it was just so unexpected it was so clear that the french were going to win this race and it was like a switch was flipped and lezak pulled it out
3444312 those others pop off the screen and stand out but they dont have all the elements this one had with all the characters involved and the hollywood script
3444313 just like skip we were fans of the team in the lean years in the 70s and the 80s

3444319 you all were the bass notes to the soundtrack of my fathers life
3444320 ive gone from a naive 15 year old in sydney to an under pressure 18 year old in athens to a 22 year old now and i guess im sort of relieved
3444321 i just went out there and executed my race plan and thought of nothing else just did what i had to do
3444322 i was probably as low as you could get after athens
3444323 when you work so hard and put everything into it and when youre told youre the best swimmer in the world and you cant be beat its difficult basically my whole life worth was based on winning olympic gold
3444324 i know who the believers are and this is for them criticism is ok it makes this more worthwhile
3444325 ive only been working with rohan for a year and i think in that year ive gained twice as much experience as what i had in the past eight years
3444326 we got medals in the event were not that good in
3444327 aint no commenters like deceiver commenters cause deceiver commenters dont stop
3444328 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year
3444329 thank you for having the balls to cut through the spin and hype
3444330 oh my god can i come and work for you people
3444331 it is nice to get intellectual about something that really has no bearing on anyones life
3444332 another blog filled with the angry ramblings of the jealous and envious
3444333 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
3444334 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
3444335 how did i ever live without the keen insights and cutting observations of deceiver
3444336 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3444337 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3444338 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3444339 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3444340 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3444341 if youre not involved in the sport im not sure you can fully appreciate it
3444342 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3444343 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3444344 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3444345 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3444346 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning
3444347 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3444348 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3444349 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right

3444360 and thats the proper role for an institute in social science at ncar
3444361 i can tell you in the science divisions here its the worst mood people have seen in a long time and one reflection is people walking away
3444362 a number of people are saying that our climate modelling programme has taken too big of a hit people are saying very loudly that ncar is not setting its priorities the way it should
3444363 the simple fact of the matter is that years of tight budgets are coming home to roost

3444378 yet none of them speak of the horror of chinas one child policy and its numerous forced abortions
3444379 as the world watched 15 000 individual chinese performers during the olympic opening ceremonies on august 8 it was sobering to think that probably not one of these performers has a living brother or sister
3444380 with chinas one child per family policy in existence for decades it is likely many of these young performers brothers and sisters were sacrificed often brutally to chinas communist regime

3444444 this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well they play very good football and had a fantastic season
3444445 so i am very happy to come here with the opportunity to play in the premier league we are also playing in europe this season so that will be good
3444446 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here
3444447 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3444448 well still have some players coming in to give us a chance and if were lucky enough to qualify for the group stages of the uefa cup that would take us right up to christmas and well most definitely need the squad
3444449 last season we were exceptionally lucky with injuries eight or nine players played over 30 games and we didnt have big runs in the fa or league cup therefore we were able to concentrate on the league
3444450 all that could change this season and the fact is that we need the squad to be bigger to cope with that thats what were trying to do
3444451 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership
3444452 in germany we always said the biggest thing to win is the league title because it is a competition for the whole season so we are looking for this title and also the champions league
3444453 we have a big target to win not just one title but go for all four so we need a big squad
3444454 the last few seasons we have done very well and we were very close but we want to win these titles and this season we will try again
3444455 if you dont know whats wrong after about five or six months and you have no improvement it is difficult in your mind to motivate yourself
3444456 to walk in the gym to walk with the physio and feel a little bit of an improvement then you get the motivation and you can keep going
3444457 but if you have no improvement then thats difficult and so i was very happy after i came back in december to play and come so close to a title
3444458 the confidence among the players is as high as i have known
3444459 every player has looked back at last season and seen how close we were despite the injuries and everything that happened
3444460 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3444461 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3444462 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3444464 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
3444465 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
3444466 the higher levels among controls translate into important differences in overall daily functional limitations
3444467 disability and survival curves continued to diverge between groups after the 21 year follow up as participants approached their ninth decade of life
3444468 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3444469 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3444470 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3444484 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3444506 i have made a decision to end the operation to force the georgian authorities to stand down
3444507 the operation has achieved its goal security for the peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3444508 russia supports the osce and eu line that a ceasefire agreement is absolutely essential but we have questions over several points
3444509 we can hardly agree to this as it implies that georgian so called peacekeepers should be in south ossetia georgian peacekeepers cannot be there they committed crimes shooting their own russian colleagues with whom they were serving
3444510 separate georgian military groups are sporadically attacking the positions of russian peacekeepers
3444511 has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3444512 we decided that georgia will leave the cis we urge the ukraine and other countries to also leave the commonwealth of independent states which is dominated by russia
3444513 we havent shot the ball well from the outside since weve been here
3444514 i think were taking shots that these guys can hit and we still score 100 points but if we start hitting 3s we are going to be a lot better youre always better when you score hitting shots i like the fact that we havent really gotten hot yet and it hasnt affected the intensity of our defense i think it says a lot for the character of our guys

3444518 before his speech cornyn said he is looking forward to debating rick noriega his democratic opponent
3444519 were talking about the formats and how many but i think come september certainly not later than october well be teeing it up he said
3444520 rick noriega challenged john cornyn to debate today calling on cornyn to answer up to texans for his failed status quo energy policies his votes against affordable health care his continued failed policies in iraq and his coziness with washington special interests
3444521 while not offering details of how many debates noriega wants when and where they should be held and under whose sponsorship noriega spokeswoman holly shulman suggested reluctance on cornyns part to participate senator cornyn doesnt even want to show up for the job interview she said
3444522 noriega spokesperson holly shulman emailed me to make clear that cornyns camp has not yet spoken to noriegas camp about debate plans
3444523 i think cornyn meant internally discussing format because we have not heard from them she said
3444524 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them

3444552 i have worked at victory gardens for almost my entire working life in many ways the theater has been my life and many of you have been like family to me thank you for your support of victory gardens and of me personally over those years however i have long planned to have a new career post victory gardens with the next ten years of my working life i hope to make a contribution in education human services or possibly grant making
3444553 i will miss the artists and audiences with whom i have been united in sharing the mission and values of victory gardens together we successfully established victory gardens as a premier regional theater dedicated to playwrights and their works that has brought great joy and meaning to my life as i hope it has to many others
3444554 chicagos theater community owes a huge debt of gratitude to marcie mcvay for her 30 plus years of working creatively and tirelessly to build and support the off loop theater movement as for victory gardens with its unique important and risky mission of developing new work marcie mcvays name is synonymous with all the success the theater has enjoyed there is a reason that her name is carved above the entrance of our beautiful new home at the biograph her passion extraordinary fundraising abilities and boundless energy have kept the art and victory gardens alive
3444555 marcie mcvay has been the heart and soul of the theater as victory gardens grew from its original location at 3730 n clark now cabaret metro to a shared spacewith the body politic theatre at 2257 north lincoln avenue and now to the beautifully renovated victory gardens biograph theater where our productions are currently performed she leaves an indelible mark as managing director of victory gardens we are however fortunate that marcie will be leaving behind a strong organization with a clear mission and committed audience we are confident victory gardens will attract new outstanding managerial talent we are also pleased that our artistic director dennis zacek will continue focusing on our mission of producing new works by our esteemed playwrights ensemble and other nationally acclaimed playwrights furthering our growth as an american center for new plays

3444573 an important motivating factor to migrate to inews 2 7 is seeing how the inews community feature creates new ways for our reporters to work together our journalists are becoming media agnostic so whether the story is for the radio television or web we need to turn content around quickly and reliably
3444574 the new content sharing capabilities will enable us to take full advantage of all broadcast stories within our four systems and eventually enable us to change the way we handle things by integrating all of the tools used by journalists the beta tests concluded that the implementation of inews 2 7 could present an excellent opportunity for our editorial teams to redefine how they segment the newsroom and improve the overall functionality of their daily tasks

3444578 technology in all sports keep advancing and i think they will as technology grows i think sports kind of have to keep up with that technology its a great suit i love it
3444579 hopefully our sport stays that way certainly no one wants to lose to a suit we swim the race against the athletes next to us not the technology
3444580 personally i dont have any positive test to back it up but yes i think doping exists
3444581 the sport has become entertainment and its taken on the morals of entertainment we rely on an inadequate doping agency for the proof youre innocent until proven guilty the key word being proven it can be very depressing for clean athletes
3444582 the original excalibur series is something i enjoy a great deal its an outreach comic it says to the audience that were all here to have fun so therell be characterization and action but also frame breaking humor in jokes stuff done just because wed all like to see it and that feeling turned out to be the correct one on the part of its creators
3444583 its an enormous chris claremont playground it attracted a vast audience it remains great fun today and at its best it achieved a kind of giddy lunacy which represents one small part of the british character very well its not where i am with captain britain now because now hes daniel craig and not roger moore but lets not forget that roger moore was wildly successful and brilliant at what he did and this comic loves kitty pryde as much as i do

3444712 it looks like he simply has chosen to disregard the detailed substantive input we have developed over the past year
3444713 if this press release is any indication of what we can expect in a contract well soon be reading a contract which sells the citizens out

3444866 measure passed on an overwhelming voice vote with no one speaking in opposition
3444867 it is horrendous especially the first three or four yards of the rough why do the first three or four yards and not the next ten
3444868 it hurts the guy that are straight it hurts the guys that miss the fairway by two yards it doesnt hurt the big bombers who miss my 10 or 15 yards its stupid i dont like it at all
3444869 i was happy to break 80 after being seven over after 12 holes standing on the 17th tee i asked my caddie if he could hear the sea as well as i am sure i could hear my holiday calling but i dug in there
3444870 i didnt do a lot wrong the fairways are narrow and unfortunately if you miss the semi by a foot you are worse off than if you miss by 20 yards which you need to take different peoples opinions as the whether that is fair
3444871 you have to reward the accurate players like they did at the us open it is a difficult course any way with the greens and the pin positions to protect it
3444872 i am not sure you need rough as long as it is and you certainly dont need to sweep it back towards the tee the night before the tournament when we have played it as it is in the practice rounds
3444873 unbelievable i couldnt believe the change in the golf course in 24 hours it was a different golf course out there
3444874 the greens are burning up crusting up the fairways are quicker the whole place has toughened up by two or three shots today
3444875 there are a few unfair holes the 17th is extremely unfair i couldnt hit a better shot i cut a three iron straight up in the air as good as i can hit it it pitches 15 feet short of the hole and runs over the back dead
3444876 if they are spending more its in adjusted for inflation dollars this is about some right wing troglodytes in the party overcome with self righteous indignation that people like toronto broadcast journalist avi lewis received funding

3444878 a window into the machiavellian political tactics of killing a small but crucial government program
3444879 the government knows that if the story is framed honestly there will be little support for killing the program and so in the middle of a summer when canadians are having trouble paying for gas they find a few examples of grant recipients that will enrage their conservative base and use that as a political rationale for doing something that would otherwise hurt them politically now theyve succeeded in framing the story in terms of who deserves public funding rather than who supports it and that is cynical in the extreme

3444899 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
3444900 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists

3444920 its very clear that were in for a dose of stagflation with the economy slowing abruptly and inflation too high and increasing
3444921 yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet
3444922 the most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy
3444923 the governments unjust public sector pay policy means that our members are having to cope with the biggest rise in inflation since records began on a real pay cut
3444924 although it is difficult for the monetary policy committee to consider rate cuts while inflation is still rising it should not hesitate to cut rates later in the autumn once it is clear inflation has peaked

3444959 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3444960 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict

3444966 how many more young lives and families will be destroyed before this bullying is addressed and eradicated
3444967 when someone takes their own life the pain and suffering does not stop with the death of that person
3444968 its the loved ones left behind who suffer through no fault of their own
3444969 they suffer guilt complexes like why didnt i see it coming where did i fail but the truth is it is not their fault
3444970 my brother timothys father battled with this along with the rest of the family until it became too much for him on 22 4 2003 when he took his own life to stop his own pain and suffering

3444997 right now the moneys rotating pretty heavily out of the commodities and its going into areas that have not had much attention as of late
3444998 its certainly much more a market you dont see the broad money going pretty much everywhere

3445001 are they going to feel like they missed a lot of this and do some catch up and push the market higher

3445036 when i started the blog it was just a hobby
3445037 it was pretty clear that i could make more money blogging than from anything else
3445038 gt found the long lost predecessor of samus aran of to comment but its easier if you do so
3445039 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
3445040 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
3445041 music should be a little more free we shouldnt be criticizing as much as we do
3445042 the artist and the radio are just as much at fault but here is a piece of music that you can like theres a lot of collaborations where as desire was more just me holding it down this is going to have some special appearances
3445043 i grew up on both so this project is like a double ep with a rock influenced side and a disco influenced side im gonna have t shirts that say rock vs disco which do you love
3445044 financial issues are getting hit today on worries about the credit market as always
3445045 but the market has come back a bit as oil prices have come down
3445046 until oil prices started coming down a few weeks ago there were twin worries of the economy slowing and inflation accelerating
3445047 now inflation worries are diminishing but we are still struggling with the growth side
3445048 the pilot did not declare an emergency or a mayday
3445049 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3445050 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3445051 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3445052 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3445053 commissioners are divided on whether or not to rescind take home vehicle privileges although it appears a majority favor eliminating the perk
3445054 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3445055 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3445056 a resolver anticipadamente el contrato sin penalizaci n alguna en caso de no aceptaci n de las nuevas condiciones
3445057 a los clientes interesados en abandonar la compa a a que reclamen ante los organismos de consumo competentes para hacer valer sus derechos puesto que el cliente acept las condiciones de compra de un m vil a precio inferior junto con unas condiciones de servicio si movistar hubiera aplicado estas nuevas condiciones probablemente ese cliente no hubiera cursado el alta y por lo tanto tampoco hubiera aceptado la compra de un m vil a precio inferior
3445058 this is simply not a time for politics as usual
3445059 until i voted for sen obama i had never voted for a democrat so i think my republican credentials are sincere
3445060 john mccain good man that he is will be a continuation of bush
3445061 family fun day on saturday its a day to honor the puppy raisers and other volunteers who do so much to make our guide dog partnerships possible the

3445063 i thought i cant do a thing about it so let me become successful and powerful enough where i can have a voice to make a difference
3445064 his first solo album presenting isaac hayes was released that year
3445065 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children and he loves the ladies
3445066 i was shocked to see peoples full date of birth revealed even though i knew they had their privacy set up correctly to supposedly hide the information
3445067 its essential that users of social networks should have confidence that their privacy will be protected and its especially important with information like your date of birth which can be a golden nugget for a committed identity thief
3445068 its good that facebook fixed the problem but can people feel confident that this kind of mistake wont happen again in future
3445069 my advice to facebook users would be even if your date of birth is set to be non visible change it to a made up date in case this kind of blunder happens again facebook and other social networking websites need to be more careful about protecting their members data or risk losing users

3445082 fiquei realmente chateado com as vaias de parte da torcida mas a comemora o em nada teve nada a ver com isso nosso grupo muito unido e mesmo num momento complicado essa uni o n o se abalou por isso minha tentativa foi de parar o ja lton apenas para comemorarmos juntos um gol t o importante naquele momento n o teria nem tempo para pensar em outra coisa fui criado no flamengo e sei da for a que nosso torcedor tem se n o contarmos com esse apoio fica complicado reverter qualquer situa o

3445086 sei que houve contato do flamengo com o jogador e com o clube franc s mas n o sei detalhes dessa negocia o o ilan est disposto a jogar no futebol brasileiro mas por empr stimo acho complicado pois o clube dele j recusou esse tipo de negocia o com outras equipes da europa

3445094 barbarians look this is georgian democracy if it werent for russia we would already have been buried here
3445095 theres still some occasional sniper fire but we are finishing them off steadily and surely
3445096 the place is so dirty and infected we cannot take patients here any more
3445097 this is the kind of humanitarian aid being sent in by georgia
3445098 the canucks are looking forward to another successful training camp in whistler this september
3445099 we have tremendous support across the province and are pleased that we are able to bring the team to our fans in the whistler area this year the canucks have received first class treatment from the fans and venue in whistler previously and we look forward to continuing to build upon this relationship
3445100 while our event is primarily seen as entertainment seeks to change the perceptions of our district and highlight our communitys uniqueness
3445101 it gives our local businesses an opportunity to benefit from the high volume of people that come down to the area to attend our event the younger generation are used to the multiplex digital sound and stadium seating but you still get the folks who love drive in experience
3445102 one fish lays on its side and looks like hes dead but hes not really dead
3445103 you can never really tell how old the fish is
3445104 youre not just going to bust out a ladder and get that fish out as the ferrys coming in
3445105 creative suggestions such as a kayaking boathouse next to joseph lyons park tompkinsville a bike sharing program and an outdoor ice skating rink near the st george ballpark are scattered throughout the proposal like hidden candy
3445106 i think this is a really great beginning toward taking ownership of our neighborhood
3445107 we have to get people excited about what the downtown area could be
3445108 tourists still do not leave the ferry terminal nor can they easily find local attractions the area still has too many sectors that are neglected and deteriorated the sir stations are unattractive and unsafe the existing zoning is inadequate to the task of contributing the to rebirth of the area the pedestrian experience is marred by unappealing streetscapes and public places and cultural activity needs to be made a center piece of this revival

3445111 i can assure everyone villa and silva will stay next season with valencia
3445112 the team is better than we were a few days ago we have committed less mistakes than we have done in previous games
3445113 we now need to continue to prepare for the super cup and the league
3445114 i think that we have had some tough games against sides that were ahead of us in their preparations physically and that made things more difficult
3445115 what we have to do is forget about the results and focus only on the performances
3445116 i want to succeed in spain but i need more confidence from the coach
3445117 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm
3445118 the current plans for the treaty are much too weak to get us back to safety
3445119 the staten island ferry has been one of our citys worst polluters
3445120 with this bill gone will be the odors and more importantly gone will be the poisons which got into our lungs both while were on the ferry and when were on land
3445121 the way he is attacking this meet he isnt just winning he is destroying world records on the way
3445122 it feels awesome i was actually glad to have made the final for the first time after missing out at sydney and athens so to win the gold is amazing
3445123 it felt like the only people that believed in us was us
3445124 people often say there is no room for sentiment in football
3445125 well the biggest test of that will come in the next few days when we find out whether thierry henry really would be interested in joining manchester united
3445126 the former arsenal hero has said in the past he would only ever return to england to play for his old club again
3445127 but if you ask me i wouldnt blame him if he went to play under alex ferguson especially if barcelona want to get rid of him
3445128 most arsenal fans would love the french idol back at the emirates one day but its fairly obvious arsene wenger doesnt want him
3445129 of course arsenal fans would be devastated if henry joined their biggest rivals in their book there is no worse crime
3445130 but look at this sensibly thierry who turns 31 on sunday still has bags to offer and only a few years left to show it for one reason or another he hasnt had the kind of success at barcelona hed have probably hoped for
3445131 if he is out for one last move then he will want to come back to england where everyone loves him and he can be the main man again
3445132 other than arsenal theres only one team for a player of that calibre and thats united

3445139 they would be exciting times for the kid ritson said
3445140 hell be doing his best and having a good time i suppose there isnt that much expected of him at the moment hes got nothing to lose if things dont work out people will say hes only young
3445141 but he still has to work hard he cant take anything for granted and has to keep a level head he should enjoy it because who knows when it will all end it could be taken at any time i hope he does well in the game
3445142 it wasnt as much pressure as i thought it would have been but thats because of the boys and the way theyve treated me over the last week theyve really made me feel comfortable he said
3445143 my dream was to play nrl while im still at school and to do it while im still in year 11 its just a great thing and i cant believe its happened
3445144 if theres 62 members you definitely need 32 to pass a bill now the question becomes if theres a vacancy does that reduce the number id say no

3445163 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3445164 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3445165 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

3445169 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3445170 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3445171 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition

3445398 ensure that there is a calculation and analysis of the need to provide flexible fossil fuelled back up capacity for the increased level of intermittent renewable e g marine and wind generation estimates suggest that this back up capability could amount to over 90 per cent of this intermittent capacity itself overall then that could require an increase in the uks installed generating capacity from todays 76gw to more than 120gw by 2020
3445399 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3445400 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3445401 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3445402 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding

3445405 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3445406 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3445407 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3445408 with gas prices at 4 a gallon and this might be the summer low even the affluent find it hard to ignore the impact of filling your tank a couple of times a week
3445409 in all of the green issues thats studied women popped as being much more concerned than men this is an important signal for luxury marketers to sit up and take notice as women are often the major shoppers for a family making the primary decisions about the products and services the family will purchase for luxury consumers an increasing number are looking to a companys environmental practices before making a purchase
3445410 a lot of marketers are skeptical about the green trend they dont know whether it has legs or is just a fad of the moment i am convinced that this issue is only going to gain momentum in the future with the affluent consumers in particular taking the lead as early adopters of green living so the call is for luxury brands to connect with their customers who are increasingly green aware and eco conscious by making green marketing a part of their strategy luxury marketers can learn by studying trend setters who are creating a dedicated following among green living luxury consumers
3445411 saks fifth avenue is another trend setter in the green marketing category
3445412 from converting their extravagant fifth avenue christmas display to led lights which drastically reduced energy consumption to their green house home of eco smart style online initiative where website visitors can shop for eco friendly designer fashion home furnishings and jewelry made from recycled metals the retailer is putting efforts behind helping their affluent customers live responsibly
3445413 another interesting initiative for saks is a new sales area just introduced in five of its stores called the beauty of living well
3445414 my advice to luxury marketers is not to wait but start to plan for green marketing initiatives that will connect with the priorities of their increasingly green aware consumers this trend isnt going away on the contrary it will only grow and luxury consumers will expect their favorite luxe brands to go green along with them

3445531 i have a clear right to maintain the status quo which prevailed immediately prior to gibbs commencing with his unacceptable behaviour and demanding that the marriage ends without further efforts at rescuing the relationship
3445532 tenielle wished to live a lavish and extravagant lifestyle which resulted in us incurring debt and over extending ourselves financially to such an extent that we were regularly approached by the relevant banking institutions regarding my overdrawn accounts
3445533 i believe that tenielle should be obliged to utilise the income to maintain herself and not to grow her businesses at my expense
3445534 it is relevant to point out that throughout our marriage i continuously requested that tenielle contribute towards the lavish lifestyle insisted upon by her and that she secure meaningful employment to achieve this
3445535 tenielle failed to do this and insisted upon establishing her businesses while expecting me to fund such businesses this became a major bone of contention between us and contributed in no small measure to the breakdown in our relationship
3445536 her list of monthly expenses includes r25 000 for rent for a flat when they had not agreed to rent as high as this r6 000 for groceries and detergents r5 000 for petrol where does she go each month that she spends this much on petrol r5 000 for clothing r2 500 for skin products and toiletries r2 500 for her cellphone what who the hell spends this much on the phone and where does she call to r2 500 for entertainment r2 500 for holidays r3 000 for a psychologist r2 000 for an apple macbook with a 3gb internet connection r10 000 for her credit card why does she need a credit card of this size and life policies to the value of r5 000

3445546 the explosion of new media especially on the internet is providing opportunities to highlight the accomplishments of our teams and student athletes
3445547 it has been difficult for division iii institutions and conferences to receive media coverage from traditional television and print media outlets utilization of the youtube site provides a delivery system to disseminate our team and student athlete stories and keep our fans updated on the latest news and issues from the conference

3445554 i wanted to do the most positive thing with what ive learned from my own mistakes and successes and i wanted to work with the people i most admire chris bob and connee and for the people i most admire athletics directors and heads of nonprofit organizations
3445555 i am not seeing national governing bodies or schools and colleges stepping up to the plate saying this has to change and heres a plan to do that
3445556 these are issues of under represented groups and lower socioeconomic groups that are critical over these coming years if you have any sense of social justice
3445557 es importante en unidad ir hacia la aprobaci n de la constituci n pol tica del estado
3445558 no solo elige sino ratifica o revoca a sus autoridades
3445559 convoco a todos los prefectos a trabajar por todos los bolivianos respetando las leyes y las normas
3445560 si me ratifican con m s de un 54 voy a convocar a todas las autoridades para buscar consensos y que el pueblo pueda aprobar una constituci n pol tica del estado boliviano que es un tema pendiente
3445561 en bolivia hay un escenario ptimo para sentarse a negociar
3445562 escenario ptimo para que haya una concertaci n de posiciones y a trav s de ella se d el pacto social que se exprese en una nueva constituci n de unidad e integraci n de toda bolivia
3445563 para ir tom ndole el pulso al pa s en cuanto a c mo encarar c mo abrir espacios de construcci n social
3445564 va a depender mucho del c mo se transita del discurso a los hechos
3445565 lo que hay que esperar es una convocatoria m s formal al di logo y en funci n de eso ver cu l es la reacci n de los prefectos opositores ratificados
3445566 por ahora todav a estamos en el discurso radical de los prefectos de la media luna
3445567 sea s lo el reflejo de los remanentes de la campa a del revocatorio y que con el correr de los d as se serenen los nimos y se acepte este espacio de concertaci n
3445568 hay dos actitudes que pueden aumentar la polarizaci n y desviar el camino del di logo que el presidente lleve adelante la votaci n de su constituci n sin hacerle cambios o que los prefectos apliquen e implementen los estatutos auton micos
3445569 una reafirmaci n de una voluntad democr tica que se reflej en el resultado chile desea que se refuerce la estabilidad democr tica en bolivia se respete la integridad territorial y el resultado de este refer ndum implique avanzar hacia la paz social y que se puedan dar por superados los conflictos que han ocurrido en el pasado
3445570 empujando para que la estabilidad democr tica la integridad territorial y la paz social avancen en bolivia y no retrocedan
3445571 no es problema de evo de si voy a ceder se trata de buscar consenso con todos porque el acuerdo depende del pueblo no de evo
3445572 hay que escuchar a los prefectos pero tambi n escuchar qu dicen los movimientos sociales
3445573 si tienen un mensaje radical que depongan su actitud y trabajemos juntos
3445574 es probable que no encontremos los acuerdos que los bolivianos esperan de este trabajo del di logo pero para eso est nuevamente un referendo dirimitorio
3445575 deber amos inaugurar el a o 2009 en t rminos muy generales con la convocatoria a un referendo que dirima la aprobaci n o no de la nueva constituci n
3445576 todas las partes aprovechen esta oportunidad para empezar un di logo franco y resolver sus diferencias y definir un camino hacia adelante que una a todos los bolivianos
3445577 no ha habido cambios trascendentales en el mapa pol tico boliviano como resultados no encontramos que ha habido una pista de soluci n a la crisis pol tica
3445578 al presidente lo pone en una situaci n muy dif cil en el sentido de que necesita generar acuerdos con estas regiones
3445579 aqu no se trata de quedarse en un cargo sino de respetar la ley yo estoy en esa din mica y reitero que no es mi prop sito llevar a mi pueblo cochabambino a la violencia pero vamos a hacer respetar la ley
3445580 se llev a cabo el refer ndum revocatorio y se ha podido establecer muy claramente que de acuerdo a porcentajes emitidos de manera extraoficial se llegar a aproximadamente al 64 para la continuidad del presidente y vicepresidente de la rep blica
3445581 se han revocado dos prefectos el de la paz y el de cochabamba y ha sido ratificado por el sector oficialista el prefecto de potos el prefecto de oruro est en status quo porque est entre un 49 y un 50 y de acuerdo a los c mputos oficiales se podr determinar si se queda o se va
3445582 se podr a decir que los prefectos de beni pando santa cruz y tarija fueron ratificados en sus respectivos cargos
3445583 yo quisiera hacer hincapi en que aqu gan la democracia en su mensaje el presidente de la rep blica ha sido muy cauto muy noble muy sabio podr amos decir en el sentido de que convoca a los prefectos a una nueva reuni n para un di logo abierto y sincero
3445584 es una concertaci n regional a objeto de poder convalidar los estatutos auton micos y la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado pensamos y creemos que a trav s de ese di logo sincero y abierto tenemos que llevar adelante porque el pueblo ha sido magno en su decisi n ha dicho se ores existe un solo presidente y existen los siguientes prefectos as que a gobernar como se merece
3445585 el gobierno de colombia felicita al gobierno y al pueblo de bolivia por la forma pac fica y constructiva en que se desarroll la jornada electoral del d a de ayer muestra del respeto al estado de derecho y a los valores democr ticos
3445586 su mensaje conciliador siente las bases para lograr la uni n de la naci n boliviana
3445587 se restablezca el di logo entre todos los actores pol ticos de la sociedad boliviana y se construyan acuerdos y consensos en un marco de pleno respeto a la institucionalidad democr tica
3445588 les pido a los prefectos que depongan sus actitudes radicales y trabajemos juntos hay que dejar de lado las ofensas y las agresiones el refer ndum nos obliga a ponernos de acuerdo
3445589 ser amos ciegos en no reconocer la victoria del presidente por primera vez el presidente no ha insultado ni ofendido y eso puede dar alguna esperanza ojal margine a los radicales y les d m s participaci n a los dialoguistas
3445590 autonom as para los pueblos pero no para unas pocas familias
3445591 aumentamos en santa cruz donde estamos cerca del 40 en beni pasamos del 16 al 40 y estamos sobre el 50 en pando
3445592 estoy esperando los resultados oficiales de la corte nacional electoral cne desde el momento en que me haga llegar la informaci n oficial voy a convocar a los prefectos al di logo
3445593 mi pedido a los prefectos es que tenemos que trabajar juntos por sus departamentos pero tambi n por bolivia la participaci n del pueblo boliviano en el referendo revocatorio nos obliga a juntarnos a ir al di logo a la unidad y a la dignidad de los bolivianos
3445594 nuestro voto tambi n ha decretado la muerte de una vez y para siempre del sistema pol tico del siglo pasado para dar paso a uno nuevo construido desde las regiones
3445595 la autonom a para los pueblos va a ser garantizada pero no para grupos ni para familias sino para la familia grande que es bolivia
3445596 cualquiera de los prefectos o bien jorge tuto quiroga no superan el 11 cuando se los mide ante el presidente
3445597 la nica esperanza de que no ocurra lo peor es que las partes tomen conciencia y acuerden
3445598 el escenario de guerra civil sigue siendo plausible porque est en boca de todos en bolivia
3445599 es importante en unidad ir hacia la aprobaci n de la constituci n pol tica del estado
3445600 no solo elige sino ratifica o revoca a sus autoridades
3445601 convoco a todos los prefectos a trabajar por todos los bolivianos respetando las leyes y las normas
3445602 los invito a sumarse a esta revoluci n democr tica y cultural para avanzar hacia otras nacionalizaciones de nuestros recursos naturales
3445603 no tengo ning n miedo s donde me he metido
3445604 desde el lunes junto a los otros tres departamentos vamos a profundizar la aplicaci n de nuestro estatuto auton mico
3445605 s lo la conciencia del pueblo boliviano salvar al pueblo boliviano
3445606 este triunfo de la revoluci n democr tica y cultural es una dedicatoria a todos los revolucionarios del mundo
3445607 triunf la autonom a aplastamos al odio y al autoritarismo hemos derrotado los restos del centralismo en santa cruz nace una nueva era pol tica que dar vida a la bolivia democr tica autonomista y soberana con un cambio verdadero
3445608 estamos volviendo al punto cero pero con una base social m s radicalizada la oferta del presidente de compatibilizar su proyecto constitucional con los estatutos de autonom a ya lo propuso en enero la constituci n de morales y su concepci n de sociedad y poder es incompatible con las autonom as del oriente
3445609 si darse estas condiciones el oriente aceptar a negociar con evo morales ahora no creen en la palabra del presidente si morales convoca el refer ndum para ratificar su constituci n bolivia llegar al final de su camino por su orientaci n etnicista las regiones del oriente no se reconocen en esa constituci n en la que las demandas auton micas quedar an reducidas a nada la autonom a que concede a los ind genas reducir a a la nada la autonom a de las regiones
3445610 queremos el di logo pero no le creemos al presidente
3445611 la nica esperanza de que no ocurra lo peor es que pase lo de otras veces que al filo del despe adero las partes tomen conciencia y acuerden
3445612 el escenario de guerra civil sigue siendo posible porque est en boca de todos en bolivia
3445613 tumbar al indio por que no hab a aprendido a gobernar
3445614 yo sigo siendo el prefecto gobernador de cochabamba quiero ver que evo morales en un retroceso de la democracia ponga a dedo a un prefecto ser a un retroceso tremendo
3445615 es importante que el pa s sepa que hemos ganado en una primera instancia as haya un solo integrante del tribunal constitucional y vamos a seguir ese proceso de hacer respetar la ley
3445616 no pretendo inducir a la confrontaci n a mi pueblo
3445617 de las provincias donde morales tiene un apoyo mayoritario viene el fraude
3445618 es un descaro lo que ha sucedido en cochabamba porque al presidente lo nico que le interesaba era cochabamba
3445619 alguien tiene que estar a la defensa de la democracia y ese alguien soy yo
3445620 esto implicaba de alguna manera presionar a los jueces de familia y por lo tanto eso es lo que el reglamento del congreso de la rep blica considera como avocamiento indebido
3445621 pero lo m s grave es que la intervenci n p blica en un caso de car cter privado viola fundamentalmente la constituci n y el reglamento del congreso donde se estipula que los congresistas no pueden defender intereses privados ni pueden intervenir en causas que est n siendo vistas por el poder judicial
3445622 fueron varios los congresistas que intentaron viajar a bolivia para conocer el caso tudela y eso inclu a a uno del apra que no fue denunciado
3445623 esto implicaba de alguna manera presionar a los jueces de familia y eso es lo que el reglamento del congreso de la rep blica considera como avocamiento indebido
3445624 pero lo m s grave es que la intervenci n p blica en un caso de car cter privado viola fundamentalmente la constituci n y el reglamento del congreso donde se estipula que los congresistas no pueden defender intereses privados ni pueden intervenir en causas que est n siendo vistas por el poder judicial

3445626 with their weapons they could have killed me but they did not they want us to stop but i will not stop trying to help these people
3445627 sakari promised me that he will help us earnestly to open a new unit of our endeavors
3445628 but also snatched my liquid money about 8ooo indian rupees my atm card official identity card and other valuable documents with my address and above all my traveling kits you can see the entire thing was a trap to stop us
3445629 shefali and rabi sikari are fully dependent on md masud for their livelihood
3445630 local police picked up a kasmiri radical at md masuds house but he was released without any charges ever being filed against him or masud this is because the west bengal government never does anything against islamic radicals
3445631 is that rabi sikari the very man who laid this trap for me is the uncle of the criminal sipan
3445632 insert heresies into muslims creedal tenets and then criticize islam for being a religion of terror
3445633 is to keep us backward to keep us in our present miserable state so they can exploit our riches our underground wealth our lands and our human resources they want us to remain afflicted and wretched and our poor to be trapped in their misery they and their agents wish to go on living in huge palaces and enjoying lives of abominable luxury
3445634 older americans often skimp on other necessities in order to pay their utility bills

3445641 for the moment we have to go on with what we are producing and the boys in general will play again
3445642 there is no time at the moment to use other players because we are not ready yet with our product and what we want to show people
3445643 they have to play and believe in themselves and its also a question of you want a certain way of football
3445644 he may have ruptured one of the tendons just behind the knee
3445645 we are going to have to have further investigations before we can get a full diagnosis and length of time hell be out though i have to say its going to be for while at least a month probably up to a couple
3445646 from crowd to players to management and directors at plymouth there was an apprehension with the change in personnel we have had to have over the last 18 months
3445647 we are short i still think there are two or three players we need to really put an edge to us
3445648 the impossibility of violence the uselessness of violent means to attain no matter what
3445649 that violent means and methods in anything whatever would unfailingly produce negative results that is to say results opposed to those aims for which they were applied

3445653 since 1995 weve shipped more business laptops worldwide than anyone
3445654 this and our 5 million plus conversations a day with customers gives us real insight into the needs of the digital nomad today were translating that insight into breakthrough productivity portability and design the new latitudes are breathtaking
3445655 the new latitude laptops and dell precision mobile workstations represent the largest client product development effort in the history of dell
3445656 weve invested more than 1 million engineering hours and the result is a family of head turning products that are as solid on the inside as on the outside with features that enable better security manageability and productivity
3445657 does a dip in ganga purifies a person of all sins
3445658 yes indeed a dip in ganga can purify your all sins
3445659 you do whatever you want ganga cannot be impure it has to be pure
3445660 ipnetzone has come to rely on linmin for both the provisioning and imaging of servers in our various co location sites
3445661 linmins new api will enable us to offer even better responsiveness to customer requests for additional and or differently configured linux and windows servers
3445662 having a best of breed provisioning and imaging solution was a great starting point but being a standalone product didnt maximize the potential of linmin bare metal provisioning now with the new linmin api customers can optimize it resources physical virtual and human around business processes not the other way around
3445663 linmins ability to install applications and management agents during the provisioning process is even more valuable with the api bringing a closed loop process to customers existing environments automatically select an appropriate and available physical or virtual system invoke the linmin api and after the system is provisioned these agents identify themselves to their respective management monitoring policy enforcement availability compliance and other applications that then take control of the system this is it application integration at its best
3445664 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase
3445665 and hes angling to prevent the genocide of the badly misunderstood aboriginal natives of planet brazil and its hinting that hes gonna pull some buggers out of his ass before the end of the story
3445666 wait a minute you are telling me that if i wrote a story where hitler escapes to brazil prevents a massacre of some native americans and then raises a bunch of jews from the dead that this would be about parallel
3445667 and theyre going to give this crap a nebula award
3445668 we are fulfilling our agreement with the georgian government that in an emergency we would assist them in redeploying their troops
3445669 we are honoring that commitment and we are following through with that
3445670 commanders on the ground are making necessary adjustments to mitigate any of the impact of the loss of georgian forces
3445671 quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt at the battle space to account for their loss
3445672 i not only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitriy medvedev
3445673 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3445674 there needs to be an international mediation there for the south ossetia issue
3445675 all six reserve components either met or exceeded their accession goals for july also
3445676 the idea of the center is not only to help sailors and marines in distress but to promote good stress management and promote psychological health so it starts when people come into boot camp and lasts all of the way until they graduate from war college
3445677 the idea is that we get past the concept of just dealing with things when they are in crisis and hopefully promote a system of addressing stress and addressing our ability to cope with it so we rarely get into a crisis mode
3445678 one of the things that i like to look at when people are training and they go through drills is how can we incorporate stress training into that so that they are more aware of when they are dealing with stress
3445679 when we talk about operational stress were talking about that unique set of circumstances that people have when they are deployed or when they are in the jobs that they do
3445680 for example somebody who works on the deck of an aircraft carrier has a much different level of stress than someone who is a civilian and works in an office building downtown
3445681 combat stress of course is the stress that occurs when you are in combat the extreme set of circumstances when your life is in danger and when you have to make life and death decisions quickly and when you are under extreme pressure
3445682 the center has four major divisions knowledge management programs research facilitation and strategic communications
3445683 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3445684 the georgian government has accepted the elements of a peace agreement that the russian government previously said it would be willing to accept
3445685 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3445686 it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3445687 detaining this criminal leader will enhance security and stability for the people of baghdad
3445688 with him behind bars progress and improvements of essential services in the areas where he conducted his crimes can proceed with greater ease
3445689 the taliban uses innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
3445690 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
3445691 afghan and coalition forces always use extreme measures to avoid collateral damage in this situation in khas oruzgan the taliban was attacking the afghan and coalition forces from a civilian compound unfortunately eight civilians were killed and three wounded they were held by the taliban against their will
3445692 i was at the olympic training center in colorado springs and glenn eller was in houston shooting by himself
3445693 all of us are now shooting together in the marksmanship unit with great competition day in and out among us and its just improved all of our games
3445694 the hardest part of this olympic experience is waiting for the day to get here i wanted to compete at the highest level of clay target shooting to do that i had to commit myself to the sport the u s army and the usamu have given me the necessary resources to compete and win at the level required to win an olympic medal
3445695 the olympics were greater in every aspect than i had anticipated both in highs and lows the emotions involved are so great because of the years of training that go into that one day of competition
3445696 this is a very important step to improve relationships between the zoo and the people of iraq and it is proof that the security situation in iraq is getting better
3445697 theyre a real signature species people really identify with the beauty of the tigers
3445698 the zoo has been a real gem for the people here in iraq and the tigers will really add to that
3445699 the zoos a vibrant part of the economic and social revitalization of baghdad supporting this project fits these goals
3445700 its a nice place where kids can go its safe
3445701 in my professional opinion theyre very capable to be able to handle these cats
3445702 to me those tigers are almost like a symbol of power and pride and its good to restore them back to the zoo
3445703 i dont anticipate any problems for the tigers being there considering the zoos ability to handle them both humanely and properly
3445704 theres a basic principle we have here that you always support your military
3445705 theyre literally fighting for our freedom and many lose their lives so its the least we can do
3445706 chief pyle and the people of the choctaw nation are amazing patriots
3445707 they have done so much throughout the course of this conflict
3445708 he truly is a person who wakes up in the morning and goes to bed at night thinking about the soldiers serving our country
3445709 its a huge honor it was overwhelming for many of our tribal members
3445710 its nice for the indian people that have fought for so many years to be recognized
3445711 they truly are doing wonderful things for military members and veterans in oklahoma and in the area
3445712 mr luger worked it with a rake busting up the big clods making a flat brown table
3445713 well then must i be punished if jesus took the sin on the cross
3445714 eating only one full meal and up to two smaller meals to sustain strength but not greater in quantity together than the one full meal
3445715 ackkh what happened up 3 4 pounds in one week
3445716 there are three rules that i live by never get less than twelve hours sleep never play cards with a guy who has the same first name as a city and never get involved with a woman with a tattoo of a dagger on her body now you stick to that and everything else is cream cheese
3445717 weve seen a sharp decline not only in attacks but in foreign fighters traversing the western nineveh deserts
3445718 but the population is feeling more secure every day he said adding that rebuilding the infrastructure and finding jobs are the number one topics discussed on the streets of the city
3445719 the iraqi police and army are becoming more capable and the extremists are being pushed into the rural areas because of this
3445720 last week both iraqi army and u s military units entered several rural towns where al qaida had intimidated farmers for the past few years
3445721 these are places where security forces had not been there were beheadings we knew about those and murders and criminal behaviors in these towns in rural diyala
3445722 rigged with numerous explosive devices which could have killed soldiers or worse young children
3445723 we were having a conversation about when he would like to have the province turned back over to him and i gave him a date
3445724 he actually thought later than what i said as the date potentially to turn over salahuddin province and theyre the ones right now with the least amount of problems with security they have the least number of attacks of the four provinces in the north
3445725 iraqi security forces and the coalition forces are partnering very well that theres still work to be done in terms of the economic and the government line of operations
3445726 we are the most volatile area in iraq right now but were continuing to pursue terrorists so that isnt the case in a few months
3445727 today ive had my usual cereal and coffee lunch is noodles and sauce that i didnt use in the lasagna plus the usual options carrots apples yogurt more on that tomorrow
3445728 when i got to work i had double coffee with splenda and half n half
3445729 raisin bran with crunchy granola shaws brand with skim milk for lunch i have cheese ravioli with home made meat sauce a reasonable portion i have some options for side dishes but well see how it goes
3445730 sharp downfall in economic data coming out of the euro zone a rise in oil is not going to change that
3445731 a second half surge could come at the expense of what will be purchased next year
3445732 those interested in buying equipment in the first quarter will push it back to the fourth quarter for the tax advantage
3445733 we are seeing ssd interest in a variety of applications where historically hard disk drives have reigned
3445734 for many the most logical place is in notebook computers but there is incredible value for ssds in enterprise server systems
3445735 oil demand data are coming in weaker on an underlying trend basis
3445736 this only reinforces the view that high prices are beginning to play a central role in determining demand at least for the oecd countries
3445737 remains high by any measure sustaining inflationary concerns not least in developing importer countries
3445738 the combination of existing high volume civil aircraft work within magellan and the ramp up of new aircraft programs being introduced is expected to grow magellans civil aerospace activities over the next decade
3445739 the corporation also expects that defence work will grow throughout the foreseeable future
3445740 while sales during the second quarter increased from the same period last year profitability decreased
3445741 given strongcos lower than expected operating results challenging market conditions and the need to position the fund for the future the trustees decided to suspend distributions
3445742 we are fully aware of the importance of distributions to our unitholders however the fund needs to conserve cash to maintain balance sheet strength and meet operating requirements
3445743 its conceivable that the surviving u s financials because i do think there will be continued mayhem in that space and mergers and so on its conceivable that you will see not writedowns but writeups in the next year
3445744 our view is right now that were definitely seeing a slowdown but the u s is continuing its rehabilitation and china will slow but not fall into recession and then europe and japan thats a different story theres a more pronounced slowdown there
3445745 en las ltimas semanas he sido objeto de un juicio que tuvo como sede los medios de comunicaci n y como resultado del cual he sido condenado y he sufrido una especie de lapidaci n p blica
3445746 quiero en primer lugar llamar a la reflexi n sobre esta especie de encarnizamiento medi tico que ha dado por hechos probados lo que en realidad son sorprendentes acusaciones que no han sido ni ser n probadas ya que se trata de hechos que nunca han existido
3445747 si bien es doloroso y humillante que se destruya de este modo a mi persona lo es a n m s el efecto que se ha producido en relaci n a mi trayectoria profesional y acad mica
3445748 me parece muy injusto que a ra z de esta lamentable confusi n que me involucra sea puesta en tela de juicio una producci n te rica que ha contribuido y contribuye a la comprensi n de la violencia el maltrato y el abuso de poder en nuestra sociedad y que ha servido como material de estudio en m ltiples mbitos de formaci n profesional tanto en nuestro pa s como en otros de habla hispana
3445749 yo pido que se vuelva a la racionalidad que se ha visto afectada por el discurso medi tico y que no se sigan mezclando los niveles de an lisis del problema
3445750 si la justicia cumple acabadamente con el prop sito de investigar hasta llegar a la verdad me siento ntimamente tranquilo a pesar del horror que significa estar castigado en el mismo nivel que lo est n los delincuentes a quienes se ha condenado por un delito
3445751 tengo la ntima convicci n de no haber cometido delito alguno en toda mi vida
3445752 agradezco a la enorme cantidad de personas que me hacen llegar su apoyo y su solidaridad precisamente porque saben que yo ser a incapaz de ninguna de esa serie de barbaridades de las que se me acusa as lo demuestra la inexistencia de una sola prueba en mi contra en todo el expediente
3445753 solamente se han detenido a acumular evidencias sobre aspectos de mi vida privada que deber an estar resguardados por el derecho a la intimidad que me asiste y que no configuran delito alguno
3445754 agradecer que este breve y sint tico comunicado no sea sometido a distorsi n interpretativa alguna lo cual s lo se garantiza mediante la literalidad y el respeto a la totalidad de su contenido
3445755 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3445756 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another
3445757 customers should not stop virtual machines keep virtual machines going until we release a patch
3445758 you can also move the clock backwards on the server
3445759 vmware engineering has isolated the root cause of this issue and will reissue the various upgrade media including the esx 3 5 update 2 iso esxi 3 5 update 2 iso esx 3 5 update 2 upgrade tar and zip files by noon pst on 13 august these will be available from the page http www vmware com download vi until then vmware advises against upgrading to esx esxi 3 5 update 2 the update patch bundles will be released separately later in the week

3445774 i bet aidan would tell him about it faster than he does like how he does it with me and would be clapping like crazy when johanans done with his oral
3445775 the iraq war was an aipac war there were never any weapons of mass destruction now that aipac has cost us so dearly perhaps its time to make a healthy separation i blame our weak elected officials some who blindly supported aipac knowing full well that this was a contrived war himes proves that he is more of the same by taking one of the aipac propaganda trips
3445776 we are not even done with one aipac war and himes is ready to commit us to another one boy that training by aipac must be really effective
3445777 wealthy aipac members control many media outlets the media in the us perpetuates an antiquated 1950s view of israel as a small struggling democracy surrounded by powerful arab nations americans are too ignorant and lazy to spend the time to learn the truth israel since the second intifada which began eight years ago has been the aggressor israel is the most powerful force in the middle east with enough nuclear weaponry to blow up iran and all its neighbors 20 times over
3445778 according to the cnn special gods warriors ariel sharon walked into the vatican of mosques and declared i am a jew i am here to pray for the sole purpose of inciting a riot he did it to get himself elected prime minister his action marked the beginning of an eight year wave of violence a wave of violence that i believe contributed to our own 9 11 losses
3445779 osama bin laden and the hamburg 7 were very clear about why they blew up the world trade center they were angry about what they perceived to be injustice to the palestinian people in the 9 11 commission report they were already a concerned group of men hell bent on killing us before they went to osama bin laden for an assignment osama bin laden was the funding the how so to speak im talking about eliminating the why eliminating the root cause of why young men hate us

3445827 brazil knows more about deep water than anyone most of their reserves are in deep water
3445828 ethanol isnt going to replace fossil fuels it isnt a silver bullet theres no such thing
3445829 ethanol is one very important alternative to reducing our reliance on foreign sources of oil
3445830 i think this country has a lot of fossil fuel resources not being used
3445831 you never know if 15 years from now an energy crisis prompts pressure to tap the atlantic or alaskas natural wildlife preserve
3445832 petrobras is now constructing two major pipelines through the country for ethanol
3445833 we make so much ethanol here they need pipelines going from major producing areas to the shores so we can export ethanol to the world
3445834 but we can expect a huge amount of ethanol mill projects in the future
3445835 its very important for ethanol to be a world product
3445836 if only brazil produces this will never be people wont trust only one supplier it needs to become a commodity
3445837 instead of 10 countries producing oil we could have 120 countries producing biofuels
3445838 but this is going to produce enough ethanol only to feed the internal market because flex fuel cars are growing so much

3445840 everyone believes that with your own production the u s cant reach bushs goals
3445841 this car to fill with alcohol is 50 brazilian real compared to 100 real for gasoline
3445842 fuel choice is very important and flex power saves me money
3445843 here its about people valuing the price of the fuel in a price of the car
3445844 the market has changed like 100 percent now all the new cars we sell are flex and for two similar used cars flex and non the flex will be about 1 500 more because of demand
3445845 it just depends on what bang the customer is looking for
3445846 if theyre only looking for mileage then yes gas is better but if theyre looking at all the advantages environmental less reliance on foreign oil better for your engine taking all those benefits into account that 1 95 can be up to 2 55 or so
3445847 saab came here to learn to develop this two to three years ago
3445848 the consumers are doing it not exactly because they want a flex car

3445886 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3445887 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3445888 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3445889 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days

3445927 we have been hoping that cisco would merge the two channel partner programs into a unified smb partner program that would span products services and support
3445928 a single cisco relationship will definitely mitigate challenges and simplify how we do business with our channel partner community quite simply the whole is more than the sum of the parts for cisco and linksys
3445929 the smb market continues to present tremendous growth potential for cisco and our channel partners and we have been successfully serving the sector with solutions from both cisco and linksys
3445930 we believe that taking a coordinated approach across technology and go to market strategies is a natural evolution that brings greater synergies to our customers and channel partners alike this includes an array of channel program benefits to meet the broad requirements presented by our partners customer base all designed to increase revenue potential and enable us to focus collectively on serving the smb customer

3445960 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3445961 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3445962 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3445963 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3445964 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3445965 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3445966 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3445995 i never said we were going to the other side i just said across
3445996 we are camping here for the night there is a boat stashed in the middle of the trees here youll use that in the morning and take the river southwest after about a week or so depending on how fast you go youll pull into riverbend the trade town sell the boat and travel south to reach port len itll get you there in half the time you wont want to stay on the river the whole time though the further south you get the more it gets patrolled you can continue with the river if you like but i figure youll be more at home on the land
3445997 i think someone must have used this island for a hideaway many years ago but as far as i know no one has been on it for a while so we are safe i come here often because of that reason

3446017 i joined flickr when i started my doll collecting so that i could upload my doll photos and holiday snapshots
3446018 most of the contacts i met on there were fellow doll collectors although i did meet a number of portraiture photographers in my early days too i love flickr because i have met so many close friends on there and without the support everyone has given me im certain i would have lost interest in photography and dropped the camera in a dusty corner years ago
3446019 it couldve been great if they had stayed together what did we have 30 tds you dont see that type of combination very often thats like peyton manning and marvin harrison we wouldve been up there
3446020 in his situation hes finally maturing at age 35 actually 34 sometimes its you sometimes its me t o thought for so long it was someone else but at some point maybe it dawns on you that its not everyone elses fault i think once bill parcells left t o realized that jerry jones truly loved him and now he has a quarterback that he feels comfortable with hes listening sometimes you have to understand the reality of the whole situation and i think he did that
3446021 i still put us at the top of the nfc i feel confident in saying that because all the best teams are pretty much in our division the giants and cowboys are coming off great seasons and the redskins had a decent year
3446022 last year was a grind but the injury actually helped acclimate me to being the type of quarterback that ive wanted to be its helped me in certain areas
3446023 i might end up somewhere else and im prepared for that
3446024 he wasnt concentrating but was jumping high he was not focusing and im a bit disappointed
3446025 i negotiated a very tough deal he had to step down immediately from both his posts as president of the serb part of bosnia and as head of his party and he did so
3446026 we heard that professor mcgonagall hired a new defense against the dark arts teacher do you know who it is
3446027 good thing for me its not a state secret just a whim of the headmistresss
3446028 okay elderly gentlewomen then is that better i still cant see any of them teaching at hogwarts
3446029 if you fill out these forms now itll save quite a bit of time when you come in to register
3446030 i can hand them in tomorrow to the proper officials but if you take them in youll have to sit around and wait while they emboss each one ten times and stamp it twenty five times theyll all want to show off to their colleagues how theyre helping harry potter become an auror
3446031 its all a ridiculous game down there and when perce shows up tomorrow with twelve feet of parchments filled out by harry potter itll be a career day for him
3446032 better than sitting around offices all day with people staring at me
3446033 excellent excellent well have this business done in no time and then we can have lunch ron said hell join us i had all your parchment work processed yesterday a couple of people had to be prodded a little but everyones very enthusiastic very enthusiastic and after lunch well see minister shacklebolt hes going to tell you who your mentor will be
3446034 he said to meet him in his office at one oclock he and his friend had something to do
3446035 she just started working with him yesterday but i think they already knew each other ill have to ask george if he knows anything about her
3446036 it looked to me like they were more than friends
3446037 well did anyone say anything to you about what youll be doing i mean you are a little behind at this point i dont think youll have any trouble catching up but we just started going out on cases a week or so before the holiday break i wonder if theyll let you do that right away
3446038 i dont want special treatment if i have to sit in a classroom for a couple of months thats fine but no one said anything i was just signing papers all morning and i have no idea what they were for all i know i signed away all my gold in gringotts
3446039 you just met the people who really run the ministry we call them ministry gnomes just nod when they tell you to do something then ignore it they dont expect you to actually do what they say as long as you agree with them
3446040 thats the beauty of it people like dad saliyah and i have to admit percy just go out and do their jobs
3446041 kingsley has credibility because of what he did at hogwarts last may so every once in a while the gnomes listen to him but saliyah has a problem shes his girlfriend so no matter how competent she is the gnomes have a built in excuse to ignore her or even sabotage her you mate would not have that problem in fact the same slugs who sit around oozing slime all day and making it hard for everyone else they would probably do whatever you wanted
3446042 they didnt like it when the death eaters were running things the bastards were cruel and arbitrary and a bunch of bureaucrats got thrown into azkaban just for fun did you know that the day after you killed riddle there was a mini revolt here some people got hurt but they made it a lot easier for kingsley to take over when dad came back to work he found your picture on walls all over the place
3446043 not from everywhere but you wont see any in the training program office pester took them all down
3446044 i cant imagine that shagging his prime suspect was what they expected him to do
3446045 itll take him years to get his career back on track if he decides to stick around that is
3446046 harry im so sorry i got delayed in a magical transportation meeting come
3446047 were you waiting outside im sorry if i had known i would have asked you to come in
3446048 well first of all welcome to the ministry of magic i cant tell you how pleased i am that youre now working for us my level of optimism about the future has just increased tenfold
3446049 for so many years i thought of this place as the enemy but now here i am about to start a job
3446050 percy told you that the chief mentor and i would introduce you to your mentor well
3446051 i hope you can be more articulate than that when we go out on a job
3446052 i told kingsley thats what i wanted actually youre going to be a little bit more than my student harry it wont be a formal position but id like to consider you as my assistant as long as we dont call you that no one can complain about our breaking any rules youll be attending classes like the other trainees but your field work will be out of my office and youll start that immediately what do you think
3446053 i think im a little overwhelmed i mean i dont know anything do you really think its a good idea everyone else has been training for half a year wont they be you know
3446054 half the trainees were are members of dumbledores army when they learned that you were joining us they actually started cheering it was a bit amusing and extremely encouraging
3446055 thats understandable but be assured that both saliyah and everyone else in the program know that you will be starting a little behind
3446056 and you will have help no matter what you do as an auror
3446057 we work together we back each other up its always been like that no one who goes out on a case is alone and you harry have an even greater advantage dumbledores army
3446058 we want to recruit as many members of dumbledores army as we can do you see they will bring very developed skills but more important we know where their hearts are harry they will be very loyal to you
3446059 but youll be getting a wagon load of information the week before itll tell you everything you need to know dont worry about buying any books or parchments or quills well be giving you everything you need
3446060 okay i wont say that again but i will thank you
3446061 happy new year harry and say hello to that wonderful fianc e of yours
3446062 saliyah well thats very interesting and you met with percy too everything was in order im sure
3446063 excellent well we can catch up about everything this evening im sure molly will want to know exactly what happened ginny of course does she know already
3446064 no i dont think so i guess were pretty close but we uh we dont exactly
3446065 hes one of the beanies thats a muggle rock group very famous im told
3446066 yes ive heard of them well mr weasley do you think we can get my fireplace hooked up
3446067 level six itll only take a minute to get there the old friend i mentioned to you a few weeks ago should be there jackson bearcross hes a capital fellow and hell be pleased to help you
3446068 arthur its good to see you and i see youve brought mr potter as you said you would
3446069 harry this is jackson bearcross jack harry potter harry would like to connect a fireplace in his property to the network and he needs extra security theres been some problems and he wants well why i am telling it harry you tell him exactly what you want
3446070 i renovated it and now theres a flat upstairs with three fireplaces and i want one of them connected but i dont want just anyone to be able to use it someones tried to vandalize the inn a few times so i dont want to give them a way of getting inside
3446071 theres a standard level of restriction that automatically goes on every residential connection if you want something more elaborate you have to get authorization from the magical law enforcement office
3446072 and in your case i dont think that will be a problem
3446073 it will block anyone who is not specifically authorized by you from entering your fireplace actually it keeps them from entering your network branch it costs two galleons a month
3446074 it is magically maintained in our system no one will be able to change it except you not even one of our supervisors
3446075 if you want more protection than that you can get it but the cost is rather high very few people do
3446076 well whats that standard level you mentioned would that be enough
3446077 youll have to decide yourself the standard package keeps out everyone who is named on a list that you can maintain yourself at the location of the fireplace most people use it for nosey neighbors or a relative they dont like the higher level allows in only the people on the list that we keep here or rather in our vaults you can see that its much more restrictive
3446078 no problem so what do i do now i want that second level so do i have to go back to magical law enforcement
3446079 no need to harry ill take care of it when they want your gold ill let you know
3446080 just leave a diagram with arthur showing us which fireplace you want connected
3446081 mr potter my wifes parents are muggles she was in the department of mysteries when you when you freed her and all those others i can never thank you enough
3446082 as soon as we get that authorization itll take about three days to set up the connection id say with the holiday it wont be done until after the first
3446083 its my pleasure and its also a nice break from the routine even though this is my first day back from holiday
3446084 go ahead you take it ill get the next one and ill see you when i get home
3446085 i missed you how did everything go something surprising happened didnt it i could feel something happening

3446121 iphones success raised the bar of consumer expectations regarding mobile multimedia
3446122 handset manufacturers worldwide are in the midst of revamping their product lines against this new benchmark
3446123 until consumers are presented with a clear cut simple and inexpensive value model for accessing mobile video and tv content it will be hard to segment audiences at either an industry or geographic level
3446124 it is difficult to create forecasts for mobile video and mobile tv advertising due to the fact that the market is still fragmented and undeveloped
3446125 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things
3446126 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
3446127 any fool can criticize condemn and complain and most fools do
3446128 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
3446129 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
3446130 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy
3446131 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
3446132 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity
3446133 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governme walt whitman

3446196 the situation is clear hundreds have been killed russia has used massive and disproportionate force countries that want international respect do not attack their neighbours
3446197 history has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked you only store up graver problems for the future
3446198 russia says it is fighting in defence of russian citizens in south ossetia who will they claim to be defending tomorrow russians in the ukraine russians in the baltic states who are already members of the eu and nato
3446199 this is a dangerous doctrine with worrying echoes from the darkest chapters of european history
3446200 ser a un error plantearse como objetivo la s ptima plaza
3446201 todos los torneos son diferentes y nosotros debemos ir partido a partido primero para evitar el descenso y despu s ya buscaremos objetivos m s ambiciosos
3446202 bueno eso de que debo ser el l der es cosa de la prensa
3446203 desde hace dos a os soy uno de los cuatro capitanes eso es una responsabilidad extra
3446204 es una plantilla que no tiene tanto nombre pero es joven
3446205 no pod a pedir cualquier otra cosa hasta el momento
3446206 hemos hecho todo lo que yo quer a hacer hasta ahora
3446207 es cierto que de alguna manera me ha sorprendido que s lo haya podido hacer tres juegos pero he jugado muy bien a un alto nivel
3446208 ferragosto italia spaccata in due maltempo al nord e sole al sud

3446210 per una valutazione completa del gettito sar necessario attendere i versamenti del mese di luglio
3446211 es todo clase no te regala ning n punto y te hace trabajar muy duro no pude separarme del fondo de la pista me mantuvo all cuando no me entraba el primer saque me presion mucho
3446212 contra jugadores como nadal que devuelve tan bien y responde a cada intercambio es complicado jugar ha sido mejor en los puntos importantes
3446213 no ha sido f cil he puesto mucho inter s en el choque de dobles no me acost hasta las tres de la ma ana
3446214 es dif cil de explicar por qu nadal es tan fuerte es s lido en ambos lados pero sobre todo en la derecha es dif cil encontrar un s lo motivo a esta derrota tiene una velocidad de movimientos incre ble
3446215 nadal est jugando su mejor tenis en pista dura nunca ha jugado as su juego en tierra es excelente y ha logrado una adaptaci n incre ble a este tipo de pista
3446216 estamos muy contentos con tosi en el lugar 22 en individual es la primera vez que brasil presenta un conjunto en una prueba individual y eso es muy bueno para nosotros porque promueve nuestro deporte en brasil
3446217 todos nosotros nos sentimos muy bien terminar por equipos ya es bueno colocar un jinete en la prueba individual es muy bueno
3446218 estoy muy contento con mi actuaci n incluso si todo termina aqu
3446219 lo celebraremos en el hotel pero tenemos la impresi n de que todo ha acabado muy pronto como si a n quedara algo m s
3446220 era la pelea que siempre desee tener de nuevo en los juegos ol mpicos y se me cumpli el sue o de conseguirla y adem s ganar como lo hice hoy aqu en pek n
3446221 he llegado muy bien preparado sab a lo que ten a que hacer y todo fue perfecto
3446222 no es un entrenamiento para cuartos de final es un partido muy serio
3446223 china es un adversario fuerte he visto sus partidos y tienen jugadores buenos
3446224 los aficionados chinos tendr n su peso en el partido y presionar n a brasil
3446225 los ni os aman el b isbol en estados unidos y aqu sucede lo mismo he estado viniendo aqu por m s de 10 a os y soy buen amigo de v ctor mesa

3446227 le da a los ni os la posibilidad de conocerse como amigos
3446228 s que puedo mirar de frente a la gente sin dificultad
3446229 mirar de frente a la gente sin dificultad y si hay alguien que agacha la cabeza es su problema porque no est seguro de s mismo
3446230 si ha habido absoluta correcci n por parte de todos
3446231 para m entrenar a italia fue un sue o hecho realidad y no lo hice desde luego por dinero
3446232 un tercera l nea muy placador que tambi n salta bien en la touch
3446233 es un jugador de mucha experiencia que viene a reforzar nuestra delantera
3446234 un muy buen jugador como as demuestra su curr culum dado que estuvo incluido en la primera lista de cuarenta jugadores de la selecci n argentina previa al mundial
3446235 no buscamos nada pero si algo tiene que venir a lo largo de la temporada bienvenido sea
3446236 estamos contentos con lo que tenemos pero las lesiones en una temporada tan dura como la que se nos presenta con m s partidos que nunca son las que nos marcar n futuras incorporaciones
3446237 tambi n hay que ir metiendo a la gente joven que viene pisando fuerte
3446238 obviamente que cuando se pierde hay un poco de tristeza uno siempre viene esperando ganar y hacer lo mejor pero me toc perder me toc un jugador dif cil que jug bien y que est n mero siete del mundo
3446239 creo que tuve mis posibilidades en el primer set pero luego de ganarlo nalbadian agarr confianza y jug bien el tenis es un deporte en el que sobre todo en cemento no es muy f cil sacar diferencia
3446240 el partido estuvo muy parejo hasta el 6 5 en un momento cuando quise hacer un poco m s empec a fallar y luego l gan el primer set se solt y agarr confianza yo quiz s baj un poquito en el segundo set pero tambi n se debi a que mi rival me llev a eso
3446241 aqu solamente gana uno uno gana la medalla de oro y todos los dem s pierden y creo que no siempre se puede ganar hay que saber perder tambi n saber ganar y saber perder duele perder pero esto es as en la vida no siempre se gana
3446242 esto es importante para saber valorar lo que uno hace o lo que uno hizo y darse cuenta de lo dif cil que fue lo que yo hice hace cuatros a os
3446243 hasta yo mismo a veces miro para atr s y digo que incre ble lo que hice ganar individuales y dobles no era f cil venir para ac y repetir lo que hice en atenas
3446244 lo ten a m s que claro y me siento orgulloso porque cada vez que entro a la cancha entrego lo mejor de m
3446245 ellos saben que venimos a redimirnos y estoy bastante seguro que nos han observado bastante
3446246 este es un torneo bastante completo eso lo sabemos y por eso vamos a salir a batallar para hacer nuestro trabajo como debe de ser
3446247 esta victoria nos coloca en una buena situaci n porque nos acerca a la clasificaci n a la segunda ronda y nos pone en una posici n de poder conseguir una medalla
3446248 no siempre todo es bonito y a veces hay que saber perder
3446249 federer es el gran favorito me remito a los resultados
3446250 estoy acostumbrado a que al sacar lo que se ve es el cielo pero aqu al hacer el saque solo se ve gente es dif cil
3446251 no siempre todo es bonito y a veces hay que saber perder
3446252 kate and gerry hoped from the outset that the police were following up every lead in the most thorough and professional manner possible
3446253 where any information is found not to have been followed up our investigators are working on it all of it
3446254 in a dark area she noticed something was moving and thought it was a rat
3446255 she was shocked when on closer examination she saw it was the brown shoe of a man she shouted and the man came out of the darkness activating movement sensitive lights he walked towards her saying no no
3446256 seems to us to be out dated and of no relevance to the material under investigation
3446257 the way the judiciaria dismissed a lot of the leads is astonishing at the moment kate and gerry are concentrating on the belgium sighting
3446258 no siempre todo es bonito y a veces hay que saber perder
3446259 federer es el gran favorito me remito a los resultados
3446260 estoy acostumbrado a que al sacar lo que se ve es el cielo pero aqu al hacer el saque solo se ve gente es dif cil
3446261 lo importante es ganar cuanta m s diferencia mejor porque la diferencia de puntos cuenta y la forma de jugar tambi n aunque cualquier resultado que sea una victoria va bien servido
3446262 diecisiete puntos de diferencia son un buen resultado para argentina si empezamos a pensar en un fracaso ya empezamos mal llamar fracaso a perder un partido es un error este es un campeonato muy largo y hay que ganar muchos partidos para conseguir algo se puede perder alg n partido y lituania es un grand simo equipo
3446263 muy bien pero el equipo tambi n jug bien hace dos d as
3446264 ahora estamos dando un paso adelante contra australia mejoramos siempre buscamos ganar pero necesitamos dar un par de pasos m s hacia adelante movimos mejor el bal n porque australia que b sicamente es un equipo duro nos lo permiti todo el mundo se involucr en el partido y todo el mundo anot jugando de ese modo es m s sencillo lo hicimos mucho mejor
3446265 sei do potencial do wanderley infelizmente o rendimento caiu um pouquinho erramos passes e isso acabou dificultando

3446267 foi uma negocia o entre presidentes mas a gente espera que ele cumpra o que foi prometido
3446268 during the 1950s and 60s a series of intriguing experiments were conducted on the nature and effect of feedback on human activity
3446269 apertura de discusiones internacionales sobre el estatus y los modos de seguridad en abjasia y osetia del sur
3446270 a n no tenemos un acuerdo de paz tenemos un cese provisorio de las hostilidades pero esto es un progreso significativo
3446271 de hecho el jefe del kremlin orden al ministerio de defensa ruso que reanude las acciones de combate en cualquier momento en caso de que la poblaci n de la regi n separatista georgiana de osetia del sur vuelva a ser v ctima de la violencia las tropas rusas permanecer n en georgia
3446272 hemos acordado respetar la soberan a de georgia es un pa s independiente
3446273 los pacificadores rusos cumplir n y seguir n cumpliendo sus funciones en el c ucaso
3446274 son un factor clave de la seguridad en el c ucaso
3446275 es extra a la situaci n cuando un personaje que perpetr miles de asesinatos es considerado terrorista y otro que hizo lo mismo es considerado presidente de un estado soberano elegido leg timamente el derecho internacional no puede tener un doble rasero
3446276 faruq hossain took out a pair of scissors and began cutting his students hair in total he gave 14 students a haircut one after the other
3446277 he has been banned from the school hes not allowed anywhere near the premises weve also apologised to the students and their parents
3446278 we have a fantastic relationship with arsenal they are good people there and we would never fall out with them
3446279 but we have given it our best offer and we hope that it happens if it doesnt we move on
3446280 kolo has a hip muscle problem cesc has a hamstring problem he will be out for the next two games
3446281 abou diaby thigh will be out for a while we knew that philippe senderos has a scan on his hamstring he did that today whereas fabregas did his hamstring yesterday
3446282 samir nasri knee thigh should be ok for saturday and so should kolo toure
3446283 here we go this is it just give in to it
3446284 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about videogames
3446285 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit videogame play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3446286 our response to the epidemic is only as good as the data that informs us
3446287 we need greater support for cdc this is something our legislatures dont seem to understand we have seen a decrease in funding for cdc
3446288 take a hard look at the root causes of the epidemic in this country and the need for a comprehensive and accountable national aids strategy to address them
3446289 the ryan white care act has never fully addressed the aids crisis and is based on a labyrinth of formulas and requirements that place cities and states around the country in competition for scant funding davids said

3446291 not allowing researchers to go to these meetings hampers their ability to work effectively and get the latest information live feeds are not a substitute for being able to talk to other scientists we need to have top scientists at these discussions shaping agenda
3446292 die st rke der us exporteure hat dabei geholfen da der dollar damals seinen schw chsten stand hatte
3446293 another mixed bag of macroeconomic data has done little to assure us the uk is not heading for recession
3446294 cpi inflation came in at 4 4 per cent today 0 3 per cent more than expected and more poor housing and retail sales data shows that consumer spending is almost nonexistent
3446295 todays data leaves the bank of england stuck between a rock and a hard place with regards to future interest rate decisions as a cut or a rise look a long way off yet
3446296 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3446297 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3446298 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3446299 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3446300 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3446301 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3446302 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3446303 compared to people who dont drink alcohol drinking at least a half a drink per day was beneficial
3446304 up to one glass per day in women and up to two glasses per day in men
3446305 the diet was low in trans fat and saturated fat red meat and processed meats
3446306 walking at a brisk pace which is quick enough to build up a sweat about three miles per hour
3446307 free of major chronic illnesses such as heart disease diabetes and cancer
3446308 this really highlights the benefit of having an overall healthy lifestyle for the primary prevention of many chronic disease and not just stroke
3446309 we know oxidants produce free radicals that damage cells our experiments show ruthenium produces a reaction in the cell which destroys its anti oxidant defence glutathione thus destroying the cancer infected cell
3446310 working with colleagues in edinburgh university and oncosense weve proved this could be an effective line of defence against cancer
3446311 better jobs better care new research on the long term care workforce
3446312 the effort was to see what ideas are out there for improving direct care work to make sure people have what they need to stay in their homes and communities
3446313 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3446314 the sample for this study was a low income population
3446315 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3446316 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3446317 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
3446318 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale
3446319 women who conducted their interview in english were significantly more likely to express depressive symptoms compared to women who conducted their interview in spanish
3446320 our data indicate that the increase in adenocarcinoma is real and a growing health problem for both white men and women
3446321 the government of new jersey has regulated health insurance right out of the price range of most consumers
3446322 part of the reason for this is that new jersey has 42 coverages it requires every policy no matter how basic to include pennsylvania only has four fewer but the price difference that results from less regulation is stark
3446323 if new jersey would really like to help people at the poverty level get insurance they need to repeal those regulations or let people in new jersey buy coverage in pennsylvania
3446324 new jersey is perfectly free to do that because there are no federal government restrictions on such a move whatsoever
3446325 the state has taken the initiative on health care and the private sector will have to fight hard to take it back
3446326 massachusetts businesses were not vigilant enough when former governor mitt romney r and the legislature imposed a health reform that is proving far more expensive than promised
3446327 unfortunately massachusetts businesses let the proverbial fox inside the henhouse when they did not resist the states imposing mandatory fees on businesses to provide health care
3446328 destined to fail because it has no cost control whatsoever
3446329 wants to prevent the state from raising the level of employer contribution required to avoid a 295 per employee annual assessment
3446330 many u s residents wrongly equate higher spending with better care
3446331 the notion that the more you spend the better you are in health care is a giant urban myth
3446332 allowing consumers to choose a consumer driven plan that meets their needs is better than forcing people into expensive plans with low cost sharing which the commonwealth connector board favors
3446333 consumer driven health care where higher deductibles and copayments are paid by patients as an incentive for not going to a doctor too frequently or use other unnecessary medical services
3446334 people can reduce their spending by merely explaining to their physician they have a significant cost sharing requirement in their coverage plan and by asking for prices
3446335 the rand health insurance experiment proved 30 years ago that cost sharing reduces spending by about 30 percent with almost no effect on health

3446343 seeks to prolong their life while doing what is necessary to bridge costs
3446344 denying individuals the ability to make health and life decisions because of the perception of an unequal playing field is the height of perversity and is a great example of just why a government instead of the individual patient is so unsuited for the task of making medical decisions
3446345 to our knowledge this is the first report to show that doxorubicin and zoledronic acid inhibit subcutaneous breast tumor growth in vivo in a treatment sequence specific fashion and in the absence of tumor induced bone disease
3446346 our data suggest that there may be benefits of combining zoledronic acid with cytotoxic agents for the treatment of patients with early stage breast cancer

3446380 i went to the off site storage buildings and the rad detector went off the charts then i opened the steel door and there were all these drums many many drums of highly radioactive material
3446381 how did the world miss all of this why couldnt they see what was happening here
3446382 what happened apparently was that they broke iaea seals which is very unfortunate because those seals are integral to ensuring that nuclear material doesnt get diverted
3446383 experts u s discovery of nuke materials in iraq was breach of u n monitored site
3446384 today marks the first change of command ceremony between iraqis and the coalition
3446385 this place was a place of much concern and controversy we will use it for new and better circum stances
3446386 the americans did well to give back this facility to the iraqi people
3446387 we must immediately call a meeting of the nato council to estimate georgias security and consider the measures which nato may take to stabilize the highly dangerous situation

3446413 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers

3446460 i write to you on behalf of aafia siddiqui phd a 36 year old muslim woman and pakistani citizen who is in pre trial detention at the metropolitan detention center mdc in brooklyn new york dr siddiqui is not allowed by the federal bureau of prisons bop to have contact visits that is she is not allowed to come into physical contact with anyone
3446461 despite this the bop and staff at the mdc are insisting that dr siddiqui endure the humiliation of a so called strip search each and every time one of her lawyers come to visit her for purposes of defending her in the united states district court on criminal charges
3446462 the inmate is required to be stripped naked and checked to find he she is not hiding anything on his her body
3446463 i think you will agree that this type of strip search is not only humiliating and degrading but is also offensive to a woman who is a devout muslim as is dr siddiqui
3446464 because it is so offensive dr siddiqui is now refusing to undergo this procedure and because she will no longer consent she is now forbidden from having a contact visit with her attorneys
3446465 in addition neither you husain haqqani nor any representative of the pakistani government will be permitted to visit dr siddiqui to perform your diplomatic duties so long as she will not consent to a strip search

3446513 so every now and then i would just hold up my phone to let people read what i couldnt if youre wondering about data costs i found i could get between 200 and 400 translations in 1mb of data download
3446514 although we dont charge for this service your carrier may charge for the data usage so be sure to know what your roaming rates are for my plan i found that i could translate 400 phrases for less than us 10 when roaming internationally

3446532 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3446533 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl cable modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3446534 since we began working with nvidia mental images and procedural our rome reborn project has taken a quantum leap forward
3446535 the speed with which new buildings can be visualized with the nvidia gpus and propagated with the cityengine is astonishing and mental images realityserver will allow us to create an entirely new collaborative online archaeological journal that is unique and fills a major gap in the growing field of virtual archaeology

3446548 we have taken a decision georgia is quitting the cis

3446558 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3446559 huge disappointment as time inc was predicting it would be well over 3 million after spending nearly 6 million
3446560 im not settled with just one big ring i want a few of them
3446561 coach merritt im going to be honest with you i hate seeing guys like kenny back there
3446562 but if not then hopefully soon thereafter kenny can break into the lineup overall this young man i look for great things out of him
3446563 in my judgment theres a difference between realism and pseudo realism
3446564 the pseudo realists believe that we can operate in the world alone that expanding international law doesnt matter that things like arms control are false starts
3446565 you try to work with allies rather than without them
3446566 and that is the kind of realism that i think is common sense to the vast majority of the american people and thats what senator obama is reflecting in so many of his speeches
3446567 iraq is not going to be a perfect place and we dont have unlimited resources to try to make it one
3446568 not at all the worst comedy to come out this summer
3446569 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3446570 therefore we would also expect a rise in the number of elderly patients with stroke in the future
3446571 unfortunately limited information is available on stroke care in patients over age 80
3446572 the main significance is that on average patients who lose weight following diagnosis have better glycemic and blood pressure control than patients who dont even if they subsequently regain the lost weight
3446573 this is encouraging because people who lose weight often have trouble keeping the weight off were saying thats ok its still worthwhile to lose it
3446574 the weight gain and weight loss groups began and ended at similar average weights
3446575 a very common question that women who are five year breast cancer survivors ask us as oncologists is what is my risk of recurrence of breast cancer now and thats a number that weve had a hard time coming up with
3446576 like the physical and emotional harm caused by medical errors the financial consequences dont stop at the hospital door
3446577 eliminating medical errors and their after effects must continue to be top priority for our healthcare system
3446578 i have to do the cheesecake or some variation of it
3446579 its one of those things that people come for that you always have to have
3446580 i want everything on the menu to be a signature dish i have to believe it is all of that quality
3446581 but there are certain things the customers expect you can suggest the specials maybe the lobster ravioli or the lamb chops i love them all but they come back to the ossobusco al bosco
3446582 even if you dont intend for it to be your signature it can turn out that way if the customers love it and expect it from you
3446583 i wanted to do something a little different and the small plate concept really appealed to me
3446584 i think people have gotten away from the big entree i noticed so many people ordering off the appetizer menu i decided to focus on a selection of small entrees people could share
3446585 nothing fancy just five ingredients but its the one thing always in my repertoire even my mom has to have it and i would make anything on the menu for her
3446586 over the top is how i would describe its popularity
3446587 you can only get it on monday for a reason it develops a following it brings people in who might not otherwise check us out and my hope is that their eye goes to other parts of the menu and they see something else they want to try its a no brainer if its good they will come
3446588 it is a good thing and bad thing to be known for something
3446589 but we prided ourselves on being as organic as possible and serving things that were as fresh as possible and natural the jar was a way to showcase what we were doing once it caught on i had to have it
3446590 and probably some cheesecake in fact i may just have the cheesecake
3446591 i may change it a little but it still has to taste the same
3446592 dear sir i write you with urgent business proposal for which i will pay you sum of ten million american dollars i am martin ngobe a filmmaker in nigeria with your assistance i will complete my newest film

3446604 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3446605 it is time to start looking after myself and my family
3446606 my departure and seclusion in najaf is my response to all the mistakes we have made in the mahdi army
3446607 we fought for 50 days and in the end iraqi soldiers came and violated the sanctity of our homes
3446608 i will not join those cells even if i am personally asked to do so
3446609 but najaf can wait to fight the occupier with the imam mahdi army is holy work too
3446610 i will have to make do with very little in najaf but thats ok
3446611 but i must find a way to provide for my family
3446612 these iraqi soldiers you see on sadr city streets will beat a fast retreat if al sadr orders us to fight them
3446613 they will desert if they miss a single paycheck their victory is fragile

3446650 we are disappointed with todays ruling and are considering all of our appellate options
3446651 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power
3446652 here not only did these officials cause untold harm to two individuals who honorably served their country they also jeopardized our national security for short term political gain
3446653 courts must be available to remedy precisely this kind of harm to ensure such conduct is neither condoned nor repeated

3446661 well never get reform in albany if we dont send reformers there and daniel squadrons independent voice is exactly what new york city needs in our state capitol
3446662 as mayor i have made turning around the citys schools and investing in our infrastructure among my top priorities because its hopeless to build for our future without either by helping move hundreds of millions of dollars out of our school bureaucracies and into city classrooms and by helping us raise nearly three billion dollars for transit infrastructure daniel squadrons record getting things done for new yorkers is already more impressive than many lifelong legislators daniel squadron is independent hard working and smart three things i always look for when i go into the voting booth i am proud to endorse daniel squadron for state senate and strongly encourage democrats in lower manhattan and brooklyn to vote for him in september
3446663 mayor bloomberg and i share a belief in taking on big challenges and fighting for what we believe is right and we both know that there is no bigger challenge than reforming albany nor any fight that could be more right
3446664 i am honored that the mayor is supporting this race for reform and results i continue to believe that with hard work independence and a progressive vision our state legislature has incredible potential to deliver real results for our neighborhoods our city and our state

3446691 i didnt get a ground ball out and thats what my strength is thats what my strength has been the entire year my job was to get past the fifth inning at the very least and i didnt do that i would rather have nine ground balls and throw one third of the pitches a stat like that at the end of my career when im done playing it might be cool to think about having a couple games where you strike guys out but my job today was to get ground balls

3446715 wir werden die fenster bespielen die sich ber dem caf m2 befinden
3446716 es handelt sich um einen ofen der zirka 500 vor christus verwendung fand und bis zu 960 grad hei wird
3446717 er war ein sehr umsichtiger pfarrer und unerm dlich im einsatz an unseren drei kirchen wurden laufend renovierungen vorgenommen
3446718 die feldkirchner sind eine sehr gute routinierte mannschaft aber sie haben ebenfalls keinen optimalen start erwischt

3446720 tenemos muchas informaciones que en su momento vamos a dar podr a haber conspiraci n es real
3446721 es una de las t cticas utilizadas para la desestabilizaci n de un gobierno
3446722 no voy a negar que de repente el partido no est teniendo lo que se esperaba teniendo en cuenta los resultados electorales nosotros ten amos una mayor esperanza
3446723 yo soy presidente de todos los paraguayos y tengo la libertad de nombrar a los t cnicos que me parecen que van a hacer una excelente funci n

3446731 let feingold talk he wasn u2019t ours to begin with
3446732 i tried an early version of this interface out on my trip and it was great although my pronunciation wasnt
3446733 so every now and then i would just hold up my phone to let people read what i couldnt if youre wondering about data costs i found i could get between 200 and 400 translations in 1mb of data download
3446734 although we dont charge for this service your carrier may charge for the data usage so be sure to know what your roaming rates are for my plan i found that i could translate 400 phrases for less than us 10 when roaming internationally
3446735 the sound of helms precise yet bluesy steel guitar on williams recordings helped usher in a honky tonk sound that would define country music for years to come
3446736 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3446737 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3446738 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3446739 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3446740 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3446741 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3446742 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3446743 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3446744 daddy where s mommy i can t find mommy where is she

3446773 we raided the different homes to find caches and to find people on the iraqi armys high value target list
3446774 we had been given a short time to prepare for this tournament and our team consists largely of new faces to complement the few old hands
3446775 further more we were placed in a very difficult group brazil are simply second to none and the north koreans are very good too
3446776 but despite our defeat we can hold our head high and say we did not play badly we focused on attack at the beginning and even got the opening goal but were unlucky not to convert more chances we created
3446777 ich habe mit adler und enke zusammen trainiert beide sind hervorragende torleute und gute charaktere aber zu dem was da passiert muss ich meine meinung nicht mehr abgeben
3446778 bislang war ich nach dem auslaufen immer da und hatte keinerlei sonderrechte
3446779 solche themen werden im ausland nie angesprochen und daran sehe ich dass es so eine typisch deutsche sache ist ich glaube es geht die ffentlichkeit eigentlich gar nichts an wie lange oder wie oft man am tag trainiert
3446780 der trainer ist dazu da um alles zu bestimmen und armin veh hat gezeigt dass er sehr erfolgreich gearbeitet hat und da besteht berhaupt kein bedarf dass irgendjemand sich f r irgendwas rechtfertigt
3446781 my short term feeling is its hot money its looking to make money on a trade its not commitment money thats looking to stay in
3446782 its not necessarily a sign that the bear market is over i could see this reverse relatively quickly
3446783 theres huge demand on the production side that is not going to go away
3446784 weve been adding money into some of the small caps some good companies out there
3446785 we want to be there first however were still being cautious were not investing all the cash right now we dont think were out of the woods yet
3446786 right now the moneys rotating pretty heavily out of the commodities and its going into areas that have not had much attention as of late
3446787 its certainly much more a market you dont see the broad money going pretty much everywhere
3446788 i think those trades make sense for those people who want to dip their toe in and take a little speculative turn here
3446789 i think for the next month or two were on an upswing
3446790 are they going to feel like they missed a lot of this and do some catch up and push the market higher
3446791 it feels like commodities have settled down and i think stocks as a result could see some more upside
3446792 siempre estuve por debajo de los 7 000 metros la idea es alcanzar los 8 200
3446793 miedo siempre va a haber siempre con la naturaleza no se juega

3446796 just to line up the airlift sorties wouldve taken weeks
3446797 we would ask everyone to avoid entering or touching these water sites until told it is safe to do so
3446798 there is no need for alarm as we are taking the necessary safety precautions to protect humans and animals from coming into contact with the algae
3446799 signs have been placed around the pond as a precautionary measure
3446800 these will stay in place until any potential danger to the public is removed
3446801 whats a classy dame like you doing in this part of town

3446824 several scientists describe the genetic puzzles that prompted their studies and explain how they started to tease out the existence and functioning of the epigenome
3446825 were in the midst of probably the biggest revolution in biology which is going to forever transform the way we understand genetics environment the way the two interact and what causes disease
3446826 its another level of biology which for the first time really is up to the task of explaining the biological complexity of life

3446830 the study supports the use of 11c pib pet in the evaluation of beta amyloid deposition in for example mild cognitive impairment alzheimers disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus
3446831 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether 11c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of 11c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation
3446832 we really dont know if its better than current therapy
3446833 the main purpose of chemotherapy for metastatic advanced non small cell lung cancer is to improve quality of life since the patient populations are never cured
3446834 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3446835 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3446836 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect
3446837 new hampshire residents like americans everywhere have come to realize the importance of accessing domestic supply
3446838 for years they have relied on easily accessible sources of oil and natural gas to run their cars heat their homes and cook their food but the current situation is making everyday energy use a difficult proposition for many in the granite state
3446839 congress needs to acknowledge current day realities and lift the ban on domestic drilling
3446840 the burden of high gasoline costs is weighing heavily on the minds of new hampshire residents
3446841 and congress can address their concerns by bringing forth a balanced energy policy that includes the development of domestic oil and natural gas along with measures to encourage conservation efficiency and greater supplies of other forms of energy
3446842 a lot of hard work a love for food and passion

3446857 they need to borrow money but theyre being told no
3446858 the federal reserve is freeing up vast amounts of money to help the banks but the fed can only do so much
3446859 too much money pumped into the economy will drive up inflation
3446860 at the same time businesses are finding it harder to borrow which threatens overall economic activity
3446861 financial experts say up to nearly a trillion dollars of debt will eventually be erased from the books as financial institutions around the globe get their balance sheets back in order
3446862 studies show for every dollar lost its 10 to 15 times that amount no longer able to find its way into the marketplace as much needed credit
3446863 thats up to 15 trillion no longer available to businesses worldwide
3446864 its exactly like draining all of the oil out of your engine
3446865 credit is the lubricant of our global economy and we still have a leak in the oil pan
3446866 the risk is higher and you may lose control of your business
3446867 the longer they keep the dollar weak the more inflation they build up you cant have it both ways you have to take the pain sometime
3446868 they should have opened their slanted eyes a little bit wider and looked closely at the girls heart

3446893 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3446894 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3446895 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3446896 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world

3446904 a database search finds 50 percent fewer news stories on global warming in the month before this poll was conducted compared with the month before last years survey
3446905 highland financial may not advertise that it offers debt counseling or credit repair services unless it establishes its qualifications and legal authority to provide those services to consumers
3446906 the settlement merely corrected a few technical parts of highlands contracts
3446907 in fact in the final settlement agreement highland agreed to add provisions into their contracts not even required by law so as to further help consumers make an informed decision
3446908 highland shall continue to provide quality service and choices to consumers and had no problem making the technical changes requested by the attorney general office
3446909 although we lost our home to this company i am glad to see something positive has come from the situation
3446910 perhaps no other family will be taken advantage of by them or other foreclosure rescue companies like them
3446911 it is very important for idahoans to know that absent fraud or deceptive practices idaho law will not protect you from giving up your equity and agreeing to pay a substantial amount for rent and to repurchase your home at a later date
3446912 it is important for consumers who are facing the possibility of losing their homes to work with their lenders to find an alternative to foreclosure
3446913 housing and urban development approved housing counselors will provide consumers with free information about government and private organizations that offer assistance to financially distressed homeowners
3446914 niles do you know for a fact that they equity skimmed

3446920 we know consumers need increasingly more and more space to store the amazing digital entertainment content we provide

3446922 there is no need for alarm as we are taking the necessary safety precautions to protect humans and animals from coming into contact with the algae
3446923 signs have been placed around the pond as a precautionary measure

3446926 nbcs decision to delay broadcasting the opening ceremonies by 12 hours sent people across the country to their computers to poke holes in nbcs technological wall by finding newsfeeds on foreign broadcasters web sites and by watching clips of the ceremonies on youtube and other sites in response nbc sent frantic requests to web sites asking them to take down the illicit clips and restrict authorized video to host countries as the four hour ceremony progressed a game of digital whack a mole took place network executives tried to regulate leaks on the web and shut down unauthorized video while viewers deftly traded new links on blogs and on the twitter site redirecting one another to coverage from say germany or a site with a grainy spanish language video stream
3446927 you might assume along with nbc executives that the jail break of information damaged nbcs precious choreographed broadcast you would assume wrongly by the way according to richard sandomir of the new york times the four hour opening ceremony attracted an average of 34 2 million viewers the most ever for an opening ceremony not in the united states i was one of them in part because as the day wore on i saw all manner of oohing and ahhing on the web from bloggers and friends who had peeked in and found themselves awe struck by the time the broadcast rolled around my daughter and i had been nicely primed by the web fanatics for what was after all a kind of epic movie made in real time that was best enjoyed on a big screen with good resolution

3446936 in many ways the obama campaign is challenging the fundamental political premise that has prevailed in washington for more than a generation that any majority coalition must be carefully centrist if not center right bill clinton ran in 1992 as a candidate willing to break with liberal orthodoxy on many issues including crime and welfare and eager to move the party which had lost five of the six previous presidential elections to the middle mr clintons new democrats assumed a certain level of conservatism among voters mr obama and his allies are basing his campaign on a different bet that the right leaning political landscape mr clinton confronted has changed several major democratic strategists and outside analysts as well argue that the country has shifted to the left because of the iraq war the economy and seven plus years of president bush and that it has become open to a new progressive majority
3446937 obama says if he were president hed take politically courageous stands while forging the consensus needed to enact universal healthcare immigration revisions global warming legislation and a withdrawal from iraq his three year record in the senate however offers little evidence that he can do what hes promising his party was in the minority for his first two years and in the third he began campaigning for president and missed lots of time on capitol hill he was absent from or only partly involved in some key bipartisan efforts to head off stalemates on judicial nominations immigration and iraq war policy

3446979 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
3446980 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
3446981 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
3446982 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
3446983 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds

3447054 a pentagon effort to overhaul georgias forces from bottom to top
3447055 at senior levels the united states helped rewrite georgian military doctrine and train its commanders and staff officers
3447056 georgia meanwhile began re equipping its forces with israeli and american firearms reconnaissance drones communications and battlefield management equipment new convoys of vehicles and stockpiles of ammunition
3447057 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3447058 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3447059 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3447060 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3447061 the only language that bullies understand is when someone stands up to them
3447062 this is not an occasion for megaphone diplomacy russias behaviour is disproportionate and unacceptable but the only way to bring stability back to the region is through diplomatic means
3447063 the first minister took the opportunity to have a private meeting with the russian ambassador to make that clear
3447064 the ambassador pledged to communicate that message to the russian government
3447065 russia is trying to send the strongest signal it can that it will not countenance further meddling as it sees it in its affairs
3447066 this is one of the only growing oil markets in the world and it is such a dangerous cocktail mix of politics economics and strategic interests that frankly the health and wellbeing of the civilians of south ossetia is nothing to do with it
3447067 imposing house arrest and suspending the fourth amendment for law abiding people is only going to cause more problems for this city

3447071 the government committed to a more disciplined approach to managing its spending and focusing on programs that are our priorities so more than anything its a budgeting expenditure decision and we feel canadians want accountability for their tax dollars and were following through on that commitment
3447072 concerned that cluster munition remnants kill or maim civilians including women and children obstruct economic and social development including through the loss of livelihood impede post conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction delay or prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced persons can negatively impact on national and international peace building and humanitarian assistance efforts and have other severe consequences that can persist for many years after use

3447116 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3447117 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3447118 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3447119 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3447120 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3447121 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3447122 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3447123 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3447133 yang kita bicarakan pada waktu itu pertautan jiwa dengan alam syekh
3447134 sabda alam tetapi tadi syekh mengatakan mungkin saja puting beliung bisa menghancurkan padepokan kita mengapa
3447135 mungkin disini bukan berarti akan terjadi atau tidak sama sekali bahkan bisa saja terjadi
3447136 namun mungkin disini saya tegaskan kemarahan alam sedahsyat apa pun tidak akan pernah menyentuh padepokan kita
3447137 benar justru akan saya usahakan agar enyah dari desa khendarsawa
3447138 bukankah saya sedang menjelaskan hal yang terkait dengan ilmu hamamayu hayuning bawana
3447139 saya kira bencana akan datang jika bumi dirusak penduduk desa khendarsawa akan kekeringan dan kekurangan air pada musim panas seandainya pohon pohon besar yang berada disekitar hutannya ditebang habis mungkin saja akan terjadi longsor bahkan bencana lainnya
3447140 seandainya kita telah mengamalkan ilmu hamamayu hayuning bawanna memakmurkan bumi tidak akan pernah kita dimurkai alam atau hidup dalam kesusahan
3447141 lihatlah pohon jambu batu yang di tanam ki chantulo itu bukankah ki chantulo memelihara jambu ini sejak kecil menanamnya merawatnya hingga menghasilkan buah
3447142 benar sekali dengan perawatan dan pemeliharaan saya hingga jambu ini memberikan imbalan pada saya berupa makanan buah jambu saya bisa menikmatinya dan memakannya saya baru ingat ketika jambu ini berupa bibit ya mengerti
3447143 itu salah satu contoh dimana kita memakmurkan alam maka alam akan memberi imbalan lihatlah para petani dengan jerihpayah menamam padi lihat pula para petani membuat pematang sawah menciptakan saluran air dengan teratur dan memeliharanya sebaliknya rusaklah pohon jambu tadi tebas dan biarkan merana biarkan pula padi disawah tidak harus dirawat dan diberi pupuk biarkan pula saluran air dipenuhi sampah apa yang akan terjadi memeliharakah pada kita murkakah mereka
3447144 namun selain itu tadi syekh bisa mengenyahkan angin puting beliung agar enyah dari khendarswa
3447145 bukankah andika pernah mendengar kanjeng nabi musa membelah lautan lantas menjinakan air laut sehingga dengan sebilah tongkat kayunya bisa menyebrangi lautan yang terbelah lantas kanjeng nabi sulaiman menundukan angin kencang

3447152 the point is there is no right or wrong and there is no perfect formula we do our best by taking a multi dimensional approach we look at a number of factors including how many people are following you back before applying limits
3447153 twitter has always been about limits embracing the idea that constraint inspires creativity

3447155 it is wrong to compare the success of the two films the hindi film industry is one big market whatever money earned from the movies made goes into one kitty the film industry every one benefits out of successful films actors fees also goes up
3447156 in an area like juhu in suburban mumbai there are 28 shows of the film in one multiplex alone due to this 80 to 90 per cent money is recovered by the producer
3447157 it is quite natural that the collections slump at the start of the second week everything depends on how steep is the decline in box office collections if the steep is less the film is sure to bounce back during the weekend

3447163 she came up to me and she called me an angel
3447164 she gave me this look up and down and said i guess you want me to apologize but it wont be sincere
3447165 this this was when i got my first real look at this kid
3447166 this world is pretty funny isnt it here want to share my juice
3447167 surely the famous author must have pulled from personal experience when he penned the opening line to
3447168 completing the grueling slog on saturday certainly brought the best of times and worst of times inherent in a mountain bike race that extended beyond nine hours
3447169 my hope through months of training was to best 12 hours somewhere in the 10 30 range would have been nice earn a coveted silver belt buckle and call it a success
3447170 the day started with ominous black clouds pushing over the white fangs of mountain ranges on the horizon the same peaks we were ordained to summit
3447171 as a point of reference think of the chequamegon fat tire festival hordes starting at the top of the north avenue hill in brookfield
3447172 it was truly best of times grabbing glimpses of the seven time tour de france champion pacing off the control vehicle
3447173 but with an out and back course the good times were matched with a wickedly difficult climb up one of the five major slopes that covered the 100 miles technically 103 87
3447174 st kevins pronounced kee vins by the locals came first
3447175 the major obstacle here was staying clipped in amongst a duteous tightly packed bunch of 200 300 riders in close proximity and the best part oxygen at that elevation was in abundance
3447176 my spirits rose with the realization that other true flatlanders were here testing their oxygen deprivation limits
3447177 we chatted amicably up to the second major test of the day sugarloaf here the road crests above 11 000 feet on ride able trails but where did that oxygen go
3447178 it became apparent that the measure of this race was managing energy output
3447179 each major effort was like rationing a dribble of water from an eye dropper two drips on this hill four on that little rise as a first timer there no telling just how much my dropper held
3447180 that became clear on the major event of the day ascending all 12 600 feet of columbine mountain
3447181 i settled into a rhythm on the 10 mile climb expecting to spend almost two hours worth of droplets just to get to the top
3447182 tapping out a steady but rigorous pedal stroke 35 minutes about 3 miles in panic nearly brought a halt to the proceedings this pace was crazy slow
3447183 was it possible to ride this slow exerting this much energy for this long
3447184 two of the cheesehead 6 brad amp fleck overtook me near the top
3447185 hubris caused me to scamper up the final rocky pitches to reach the 50 mile turn around
3447186 the reward was a mist of sleet rain and wind and a 10 mile descent
3447187 zipping my vest the fun began first with two plus miles of bone jarring baby head boulders at 18 20 grade then eight miles of wide open fire roads
3447188 the scenery flashed by at 40 mph in a flip card movie of the colorado rockies
3447189 at the bottom deep breaths sweet oxygen and only 40 miles to go
3447190 the return to leadville proved more difficult first with a leg tenderizing 20 mile
3447191 i wasnt fareing nearly that poorly but still had the backside of st kevins to climb and a real storm loomed over the crest of the mountain
3447192 indeed at the foot of this final climb the full baptism began
3447193 first with freezing rain then a bit of hail and sleet and temperatures that dropped to the upper 40s
3447194 the double track leading to the peak turned to foot deep rivers providing an added splash in the face and backside to keep me
3447195 finally 45 minutes later the trail pitched downward again the best of times
3447196 in another counterpoint my hands were near completely numb making it difficult to brake shifting was best accomplished with the heel of my hand
3447197 i bounced off rocks and roots for the next 20 minutes finally reaching the bottom and some minor warmth of 55 ish temps and blessedly the major climbs were over
3447198 the final miles into town drew me down the trail with dreams of breaking nine hours and 30 minutes
3447199 the major in the finish stretch is known as the
3447200 i satisfied myself by picking off a couple stragglers and pushed across the finish line in 9 hours 36 minutes good for 198th out of the 650
3447201 in this drama those who reach the finish in less than nine hours are rewarded with gold those who best 12 hours receive silver

3447311 as i urged you when i went into macedonia stay there in ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies these promote controversies rather than gods work which is by faith the goal of this command is love which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk they want to be teachers of the law but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm

3447381 said the afghan government tortured well that embarrassed the harper government quite a bit
3447382 i think what is really going on is prime minister stephen harper does not want our allies to be shown up by our reporting of their problems
3447383 those are exactly the same sorts of things that the harper government cut out about afghanistan and now wants to do across the board

3447455 when you disrupt one of them terror modules we dont go public the press will call it a publicity stunt obviously some are getting away and there are quite a few under the scanner at the moment
3447456 it the claim doesnt jell with the extent of terror india is facing
3447457 in jaipur cycles used for the blasts were bought from a series of shops the extent to which locals are involved whether they are mercenaries is what we are trying to unravel
3447458 you cant eliminate the menace of terrorism but india needs a national consensus on how to deal with the problem
3447459 we are trying to tackle extremists as democratically as possible despite occasional complaints of targeting minorities or profiling people certainly no profiling is taking place

3447485 an opportunity has been presented to me of spending my days among the heathen attempting to persuade them to receive the gospel were i convinced of its being a call from god and that it would be more pleasing to him for me to spend my life in this way than in any other i think i should be willing to relinquish every earthly object and in full view of dangers and hardships give myself up to the great work
3447486 o if he god will condescend to make me useful in promoting his kingdom i care not where i perform his work nor how hard it be behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word
3447487 i desire no higher enjoyment in this life than to be instrumental of leading some poor ignorant heathen females to the knowledge of the saviour to have a female praying society consisting of those who were once in heathen darkness is what my heart earnestly pants after and makes a constant subject of prayer resolved to keep this in view as one principal object of my life
3447488 good female schools are extremely needed in this country i hope no missionary will ever come out here without a wife as she in her sphere can be equally useful with her husband
3447489 you know i love you more than all the world beside

3447492 rain in the san gabriel mountains the third week of may actually caused our vegetation moisture levels to increase for a short time
3447493 but we are now approaching fall and its very important for the multitudes of people who visit the forest to have an awareness of their location in case they need to report a new wildfire or be evacuated
3447494 this goes for weekend recreational users as well as those who commute through the forest from for instance the antelope valley to los angeles we have had several new starts over the last two weeks none of which burned more than a few acres
3447495 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
3447496 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
3447497 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
3447498 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
3447499 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
3447500 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back

3447506 das neue geb ude zeigt sich selbstbewusst am sterreichischen platz und setzt ein markantes st dtebauliches zeichen
3447507 i think its not easy to convince people that are feeling uncertain about something
3447508 it is a difficult task but we have to do our best and inshallah we will be able to convince them
3447509 the first thing we should look at is what we can do what we will try and do is convey the type of confidence we have in the measures that are in place hence why we will go to member countries to convince them
3447510 youve got to remember that unfortunately they sit far away and theyve not been to pakistan they might not share the sentiment that we do and it would be good of us to go and explain to them exactly what measures are in place and raise their levels of confidence
3447511 some of us whove been here feel satisfied with the security measures if we can convince them then there is no issue
3447512 on the other hand we can never force anybody to come and play in the competition we will do our very best to convince them the member countries have signed participation agreements to send their teams
3447513 weve had two very entertaining days in pakistan we got into islamabad and met with officials and diplomats in the day we then proceeded to lahore to get a physical demonstration of the security measures that have largely been recommended in various security consultant reports and observed them similarly weve observed them in karachi
3447514 observations will be shared and points noted before two teams head off on missions to either side of the planet
3447515 we are following up later this week with a journey down to australia and new zealand as well as simultaneously down the other side to england and south africa where we will share with them the observations and the kind of comfort level that we have observed and noted and lets see what comes out of that journey
3447516 we must cater for diversity we know it exists by this i mean the range of relationships from single couples triples blended de facto and so on thats where were going with social policy
3447517 its entirely my responsibility what goes out under my name so its my fault that i didnt know that a speech that i hadnt given had been put on the website
3447518 i get speeches a lot that i dont give i dont want to be too critical of people who draft my speeches but i get a lot of speeches in draft that i never use they have no relationship with what i say
3447519 i havent bothered asking because im not interested in it
3447520 the social security legislation is very clear about what a relationship is youre either single or a couple a couple is in the nature of marriage which includes civil union and de facto
3447521 its been the same for years its been tested in court theres no interest in changing it
3447522 i get draft speeches from the department all the time sometimes its msd sometimes its dol department of labour sometimes its health sometimes its education it depends what the speech is
3447523 ive got no idea im sort of not interested because i didnt say it and its not our policy
3447524 there would be nobody in msd who is under any illusion that that is government policy
3447525 it sounds like a secret agenda to me i dont think that speeches miraculously appear on the governments website without anyone knowing who put them there
3447526 i know what she would be saying if it was us
3447527 now includes something called triples and my mind just boggles
3447528 playing the springboks in south africa might be the biggest challenge in world rugby at the moment
3447529 we have submitted a bid and we are waiting for arsenal to respond
3447530 what we must do now is ensure that its a lasting ceasefire and that there is humanitarian aid which we are prepared to provide for those who are casualties of what has been a terrible set of events
3447531 there must now be talks that will resolve this once and for all
3447532 we cannot continue with the situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to this problem
3447533 is obviously a great achievement for us but its only part of the goal
3447534 im very proud of the team the way they played
3447535 its like the sweden of old improving with every game in the tournament
3447536 the players are in very good physical condition i hope that means were also going to be better against germany
3447537 those dang smith boys are the culprits who egged all those cars last night
3447538 what is showing through is that were up in pretty much all areas for taranaki which is good
3447539 im not really surprised after the result of june there is always a bit of movement that happens there seems to be the rise and fall were lucky in taranaki because we are cushioned to some degree particularly with the dairying scene and the energy scene but generally its pretty good reading its nothing like sales of a couple of years ago but this is a good sign
3447540 there is an unmistakable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3447541 the fact is that for the market nationally to achieve an unchanged median price against the pressure of the declining auckland market is a remarkably good result in the circumstances and it is beginning to look like the june figures may have given a poor reading of the markets health
3447542 if this is as bad as it gets then perhaps the market is in better shape than we thought
3447543 they are insufferable because they are unsure of their worth and must therefore brag and show off and prove themselves again and again
3447544 islam and terrorism what the quran really teaches about christianity violence and the goals of the islamic jihad
3447545 it definitely sends a warning out not only to our pool but the whole tournament that we are here for business
3447546 if spain has a weakness we think their defence isnt as sharp as some of the other sides but if their forwards have got the ball the whole game we are not going to find out
3447547 we are going to have to take some chances against them if we are successful we have given ourselves a serious chance at a semifinal
3447548 our new zealand businesses have been affected throughout the period by the economic slowdown with a number of major advertisers cutting back advertising plans
3447549 colombia is the worlds leading slaughterhouse for trade unionists and it defies belief that the british ministers should be cuddling up literally judging by photographs with the perpetrators

3447752 nothing would be sillier then to claim an autochthonous development for the greeks on the contrary they invariably absorbed other living cultures the very reason they got so far is that they knew how to pick up the spear and throw it onward from the point where others had left it

3447798 new hampshire residents like americans everywhere have come to realize the importance of accessing domestic supply
3447799 for years they have relied on easily accessible sources of oil and natural gas to run their cars heat their homes and cook their food but the current situation is making everyday energy use a difficult proposition for many in the granite state
3447800 congress needs to acknowledge current day realities and lift the ban on domestic drilling
3447801 the burden of high gasoline costs is weighing heavily on the minds of new hampshire residents
3447802 and congress can address their concerns by bringing forth a balanced energy policy that includes the development of domestic oil and natural gas along with measures to encourage conservation efficiency and greater supplies of other forms of energy
3447803 new manufacturing processes will needed but once that problem is solved nanoantennas should easily best solar cells in efficiency and production costs

3447806 the united states israel and some of their european allies have begun to recognize that their policy of trying to defeat their enemies by isolating and vilifying them has failed
3447807 is in stark contrast to what arab moderates could show for in the same decade they spent negotiating with the israeli state
3447808 un black trendy french for noir has a good chance to become president of the united states a guy like us president of one of the worlds most powerful nations
3447809 what everybody would like to ignore or forget must nevertheless be stated namely that we have sustained a total and unmitigated defeat
3447810 the utmost western diplomacy has been able to gain for czechoslovakia has been that the german dictator instead of snatching the victuals from the table has been content to have them served to him course by course
3447811 if only great britain france and italy today we would add the united states of course had pledged themselves two or three years ago to work in association for maintaining peace and collective security how different might have been our position but the world and the parliaments and public opinion would have none of that in those days when the situation was manageable it was neglected and now that it is thoroughly out of hand we apply too late the remedies which then might have affected a cure
3447812 of foresight unwillingness to act when action would be simple and effective lack of clear thinking confusion of counsel until the emergency comes until self preservation strikes its jarring gong
3447813 all is over silent mournful abandoned broken czechoslovakia recedes into the darkness
3447814 in future the czechoslovak state cannot be maintained as an independent entity i think you will find that in a period of time which may be measured by years but may be measured only by months czechoslovakia will be engulfed in the nazi regime perhaps they may join it in despair or in revenge at any rate that story is over and told but we cannot consider the abandonment and ruin of czechoslovakia in the light only of what happened only last month it is the most grievous consequence of what we have done and of what we have left undone in the last five years five years of futile good intentions five years of eager search for the line of least resistance
3447815 in fact if not in form it seems to me that all those countries of middle europe will one after another be drawn into this vast system of power politics not only power military politics but power economic politics radiating from berlin and i believe this can be achieved quite smoothly and swiftly and will not necessarily entail the firing of a single shot
3447816 you will see day after day week after week that many of those countries in fear of the rise of the nazi power
3447817 which looked to the western democracies and loathed the idea of having this arbitrary rule of the totalitarian system thrust upon them and hoped that a stand would be made
3447818 the prime minister desires to see cordial relations between this country and germany there is no difficulty at all in having cordial relations between the peoples our hearts go out to them but they have no power but never will you have friendship with the present german government you must have diplomatic and correct relations but there can never be friendship between the british democracy and the nazi power that power which vaunts the spirit of aggression and conquest which derives strength and perverted pleasure from persecution and uses as we have seen with pitiless brutality the threat of murderous force that power cannot ever be the trusted friend of the british democracy
3447819 in a very few years perhaps in a very few months we shall be confronted with demands with which we shall no doubt be invited to comply those demands may affect the surrender of territory or the surrender of liberty i foresee and foretell that the policy of submission will carry with it restrictions upon the freedom of speech and debate in parliament on public platforms and discussions in the press for it will be said indeed i hear it said sometimes now that we cannot allow the nazi system of dictatorship to be criticized by ordinary common english politicians then with a press under control in part direct but more potently indirect with every organ of public opinion doped and chloroformed into acquiescence we shall be conducted along further stages of our journey
3447820 do not suppose that this is the end this is only the beginning of the reckoning this is only the first sip the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigor we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
3447821 everybody knew president bush was aiming at senator barack obama last week when he likened those who endorse talks with terrorists and radicals to appeasers of the nazis
3447822 tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
3447823 iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military i mean if iran tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything that doesnt we might not compromise with them on any issues but at least we should find out are there areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tension that have caused us so many problems around the world

3447872 the maoists have assured us that they will not obstruct the show but they have asked us to make slight modifications and give nepali culture preference while choreographing the show
3447873 we dont have swim suit round and we have been trying to promote nepalese culture and tradition through the event and this time we will pay special attention to that
3447874 we will try to promote nepali originality by minimising influence of foreign culture we will involve all the participants in the activities related with womens rights and welfare ending sexual discrimination and hiv aids

3447976 we disagreed on the overall public policy merits of the legalizing slots but we agree now that the experience of the past several years compels us to make changes

3448028 i have a good feeling about him we will wait and see we are a country with so much natural wealth yet we are so poor we really need someone who can help us we are hoping he aziz will be better we hope because we have to

3448192 above all this irony emerges clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity in fact she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make what follows is the inside account of how the campaign for the seemingly unstoppable democratic nominee came into being and then came apart
3448193 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3448194 my guess is that penns career as a a list political consultant was probably over anyway but hopefully this drives a final nail into his coffin what a sleaze
3448195 hillary clintons campaign revealed as many of us noticed someone who did not have basic leadership skills a lot of hope an admix of self righteousness and a good deal of anger but not the ability to make decisions she couldnt control her own staff and didnt seem to make an effort to exert leadership
3448196 personnel is policy the old saying goes and hillarys campaign had assembled a cadre of second raters in top positions but this is entirely the candidates fault the candidate is always ultimately in charge of his own campaign and if hillary put the wrong people in charge she has no one to blame but herself
3448197 what with team hillarys old melodrama and team edwardss new one those no drama with obama signs the obama staff hung all over their chicago office are starting to look like just the right mantra
3448198 these people arent all nuts though it seems after reading this hillary was just such a frontrunner with so many advantages that each of her top advisers was going out of his or her mind 24 hours a day not wanting to be the one that blew it as a result they just fought all the time these very smart individuals and ended up blowing it as a team and thats quite an achievement
3448199 im not particularly outraged by this let mark be mark the fact is if anything it looks like clinton ultimately held back no i was pretty pissed about that hard working white voters remark but for some reason ive come to think of it as a slip let me expound on that not a slip like clinton didnt mean it but a slip like its exactly what she meant it just wasnt supposed to be a dog whistle it was the un pc truth at least from her twisted perspective
3448200 i trust that after this we wont hear all that much more about how the evil republicanses are working to make barack obama look un american let history record that it was the clinton campaign that sought to beat everyone to the punch on that issue and it was a strategy they followed with a surprising degree of devotion as well recall the picture of barack obama dressed up in somali tribal wear that the clintons released to the public by leaking it to the drudge report recall as well hillary clintons statement that barack obama was not and is not a muslim as far as i know the clinton campaign went out on the warpath to make obama look like the other very early in the game these tactics are of course despicable the only mildly amusing thing about them is that the clinton campaign and all of the democrats associated with it acted more like their conception and caricature of karl rove than the real karl rove ever did
3448201 barack obama has twiced smeared john mccain and the republican party as racist and fearmongering but perhaps that may be better explained as projection politico reports that a campaign strategy of xenophobia didnt come from the gop it will also have one other effect and thats to put the race card out of reach for barack obama he cant call mccain a racist and a fearmonger again without first pointing the finger publicly to the clintons who obviously went a lot farther than mccain would ever countenance along those lines mccain all but forbid the mention of jeremiah wright by his campaign or surrogates this could also rip the veneer of inclusionism off of identity politics and expose it for the tribalism that it is these memos and the democratic infighting demonstrate the corrosiveness of identity politics and its eventual outcome division bitterness and loss that will help improve american politics in the long run as we focus on ideas and philosophy and not the color of skin internal plumbing or ethnicity of our great grandparents
3448202 overall clinton lost 100 points of support among black voters in about 120 days a truly remarkable achievement since black voters make up about 20 percent of the democratic primary electorate a 100 point swing among black voters translates to a 20 point swing among all voters and that essentially was how the primary was lost it is clear from reading the penn memos that the clinton campaign had very little idea this was coming there is abundant discussion about how to squeeze every last nanometer of a vote out of groups like waitress moms but very little substance about how to build or retain their support among african americans clinton to her credit declined to press many of penns more venomous lines of attack although they came out occasionally through surrogates including clintons husband more fundamentally though one senses that the clinton campaign simply took the black community for granted and didnt understand how certain of their core lines of argument might go over with african americans in particular clintons claims to being experienced were always fairly specious considering that she had spent barely more time in elected office than obama less if you count his years in the illinois state senate and had relatively few accomplishments to her name
3448203 the article and leaks hurt hillary and the timing of the release right before the democratic convention is especially damaging it helps obama to portray hillary in the worst light possible
3448204 no doubt the clinton hating obama blogs will cluck cluck cluck with satisfaction over this one seen as validation the internal memos hinted at in allens piece and dished about recently the subject of which has been whispered about among political junkies for months will also likely spur people on to asking more about hillarys campaign and what exactly went wrong and whos to blame however many will simply not write this tale until after november most democrats dont want to do anything to distract from winning
3448205 first edwards now this stuff are the stars converging to sabotage the democrats or are we doing it to ourselves remarkable
3448206 not to re litigate the primary wars but clinton spokesperson howard wolfson tells abc news that were it not for john edwards hillary clinton would have beaten barack obama in iowa
3448207 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3448208 iowa actually didnt turn out to be that close with obama defeating edwards by 7 9 points and hillary clinton by 8 1 points for clinton to have beaten obama she would have needed as wolfson correctly points out about two thirds of those edwards voters the thing about iowa however is that unlike virtually any other electoral contest second choices matter since democratic caucus rules dictate that a voter may caucus for her second choice candidate if her first choice does not achieve the 15 percent of the vote required for viability as such iowa pollsters did a lot of work in trying to determine voters second choices and in virtually every survey clinton did rather poorly as a second choice an average of several surveys in december showed that she was the second choice of about 20 percent of voters as compared with 25 percent for obama and edwards so the odds are that if john edwards had dropped out on the morning before the iowa caucus obama would have won by more points rather than fewer it was also the case that barack obama appeared to get the lions share of edwards supporters once edwards dropped from the race wolfson is making a much cruder sort of argument based on the polls and the evidence cuts against him
3448209 so if clinton was truly the second choice of edwards voters they sure had a funny way of showing it voting for obama in huge numbers
3448210 here was excuse mongering as art if you count only the primary states were winning if you count florida and michigan were winning if you count the states with the most electoral votes were winning now its if the john edwards story had broke we would have won in its specifics this claim is preposterous recall that clinton lost iowa by almost ten points recall that the clinton campaigns biggest weakness was an utter ignorance of caucuses recall that after edwards dropped out clinton lost eleven straight primaries but in broader terms the worst thing about the clinton campaign is was their complete inability to come to terms with the fact that they were supposed to lose not because barack obama is more of a liberal not because hed make a better president not because clinton supported the war not because bill clinton is amoral but because they ran a losing campaign accountability does not exist with these guys and in that they really are bush lite they had millions of dollars front runner status and allegedly the greatest politician of our era stomping for them and they got their asses handed to them but they cant come to terms with it
3448211 i have no idea what would have happened the night of january 3 2008 if edwards had not been in the race but to ignore the fact that john edwards served as obamas attack dog in iowa when discussing his effect on the race is absurd
3448212 do her people really want to go there if so theyll incite comments like mine it appears hillary is repeatedly doomed by men who cant keep their pants zipped
3448213 look the clintons have their understandable if not always legitimate gripes about losing the nomination but there is just one thing the clinton camp cant ever ever ever complain about can you guess what it is no well here it is you cant whine about smooth talking southern politicians who cheat on their wives and then brazenly lie about it howard wolfson is floating the idea that hillary lost the iowa caucuses and by extension the nomination because that no good john edwards didnt fess up to the american people what a scoundrel that john edwards is
3448214 a wikipedia editor emailed political wire to point out some similarities between sen john mccains speech today on the crisis in georgia and the wikipedia article on the country georgia given the closeness of the words and sentence structure most would consider parts of mccains speech to be derived directly from wikipedia
3448215 now i love wikipedia and think it is a great resource however lifting your report on a subject directly from an encylopedia is something most people are encouraged to stop doing in oh about the sixth grade if you your policy team and your speech writing team are still doing it when commenting on an international crisis while running for president of the united states thats both pathetic and scary
3448216 its never a good sign when a presidential candidate is caught cribbing foreign policy notes from wikipedia particularly when that candidate is trying to put himself forward as the more serious and experienced choice in the realm of foreign policy but taking a step back its always interesting to think about these stories from the perspective of the shoe being on the other foot what would the reaction have been had this story come out in relation to the other candidate in this case what would have happened had barack obama not john mccain been caught cheating on the 3 am test by appropriating from wikipedia this is a major league embarrassment one that goes a long way towards undercutting the meme that mccain is untouchable on foreign policy
3448217 the alleged plagiarizing strikes me as something of a gaffe which when added to the list points to an embarrassing situation mccain thinks czechoslovakia is still a countrybetween sudan and somalia hes confused about how many u s troops are in iraq hes confused about irans relationship with al qaeda and he doesnt understand the difference between sunni and shiia and now mccain cant give a speech about the war in georgia without relying on an online encyclopedia for content
3448218 cqs suggestion of wrongdoing by mccain strikes me as ridiculous the information that the mccain campaign apparently obtained from wikipedia is simple factual background material the idea that he should have cited wikipedia as his source for basic factual information about georgia is absurd cqs taegan goddard wonders whether a presidential candidate should base policy speeches on material from wikipedia but mccain was not basing any policy prescription on the apparently accurate background information contained in wikipedia e g the fact that georgia adopted christianity early on or that it gained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 rather it is clear from the face of the speech that mccain has first hand knowledge of the current situation in georgia having met he says with president saakashvili many times including during several trips to georgia cq elects to omit this fact this story then looks like much ado about nothing and im surprised that cq decided to run it
3448219 i agree that its probable that mccains speechwriter s looked at the wikipedia entry for basic facts when crafting the historical portion but thats hardly plagiarism or frankly even noteworthy its hardly a novel finding that there was a russian revolution that georgia was annexed in 1922 that the soviet union collapsed in 1991 and that georgia struggled mightily in its early years of independence more importantly a political speech isnt a term paper for one thing candidates seldom write them so theyre almost always passing off others work as their own
3448220 amazing how dismissive the left was when bloggers accused obama of lifting whole passages from other peoples speeches and yet the left is perfectly willing to accuse john mccain of plagiarism by accurately recounting georgias history here again is the take away point mccain has gotten so much good press for his statements and speeches on georgia clearly contrasting his experience with barack obamas inexperience the left must discredit mccain they cannot build up obama they must tear down mccain even if it means theyll grasp at straws to do it
3448221 but as a writer and former professional journalist i know from plagiarism and i think mccains detractors are jumping on this one a little too quickly i think the only reason there is any controversy is because the first quoted passages about georgia and christianity are obviously very similar they are also very short and in all three examples the text is purely expository none of it expresses any thoughts feelings emotions or other content that would be an obvious case of intentional plagiarism additionally its worth noting that historical facts cannot be plagiarized only their expression if there is any here its probably inadvertent of course if the campaign did plagiarize it at least wikipedia is released under a free public license
3448222 cohens district is mostly black if the priority is to address the needs and concerns of black americans then i assume that means the black folks in tn 09 who voted for cohen as their representative unlike in 2006 where his mandate was questionable because he won with a small percentage of the vote in a crowded field cohens victory this year 79 to 18 represents a conclusive rejection of the presumption that he needs to be black to best represent them this isnt about giving cohen honorary black status its about making sure the needs of his constituents are better served as it stands clay has essentially said addressing the needs of the black community in memphis is less important than making cohen understand that he isnt black im pretty sure hes figured that out by now
3448223 its been a while since i suited up and dumpster dived in the obama conspiracyverse
3448224 republican operatives have unearthed critical information on obama and are just biding their time until after the convention to drop it on him such as having a birth certificate that lists you as barry soetoro incredible ann dunham met her second husband lolo soetoro in 1966 in hawaii barry obama was at this time five years old the only reasonable explanation is that dunham and soetoro built or purchased a to clone a new son using dna from barack obama sr that dunham had pulled off one of his combs
3448225 so ive decided to combine my two loves of child rearing and world domination by giving birth to mega uplets
3448226 seeing a new nation born will be the greatest moment of my life besides i want to make sure the doctors put in a few extra stitches afterwards

3448249 it appears i have expressed a common feeling a shared view
3448250 china was backward throughout its modern history so we were always seeking the reasons for why the west grew strong
3448251 we learned from the west all of us who are educated have this dream grow strong by learning from the west
3448252 weve been studying western history for so long we understand it well
3448253 we think our love for china our support for the government and the benefits of this country is not a spontaneous reaction it has developed after giving the matter much thought
3448254 because we are in such a system we are always asking ourselves whether we are brainwashed
3448255 we are always eager to get other information from different channels
3448256 but when you are in a so called free system you never think about whether you are brainwashed
3448257 the same bunch of goons and thugs theyve been for the last fifty years
3448258 i can tell you everything about all those movies like star wars

3448263 problems with human rights property right disputes the threat posed to taiwan
3448264 but we chinese can use it to tell the people of the world that china cannot be insulted
3448265 up to now the chinese government has been able to keep a grip on it
3448266 but i call it the virtual tiananmen square they dont need to go there they can do the same thing online and sometimes be even more damaging
3448267 chinese tradition has many good things but weve ditched them
3448268 i feel there have to be people to carry them on
3448269 most of my generation has a smooth happy life including me
3448270 i feel like our character lacks something for example love for the country or the perseverance you get from conquering hardships those virtues i dont see them in myself and many people my age
3448271 for him from that kind of background with nobody educated in his family nobody helping him with schoolwork with great family pressure its not easy to get where he is today
3448272 leo strauss and the world of intelligence by which we do not mean nous
3448273 during the nineteen eighties and nineties most intellectuals had a negative opinion of chinas traditional culture
3448274 to assess a countrys true strength and prosperity you cant simply look at gnp growth and not look at the inner experience of each ordinary person does he feel safe is he happy
3448275 i sensed that this kid is very smart and diligent
3448276 now we started reading ancient chinese books and we rediscovered the ancient china
3448277 we opened our market but when we try to buy your companies we hit political obstacles its not fair
3448278 no matter who is elected china is still china and will go the way it goes
3448279 who can stand in the way of the march of history
3448280 we used to think they were just a postmodern occidentalized generation
3448281 of course i thought the students i knew were very good but the wider generation i was not very pleased to see the content of tang jies video and the scale of its popularity among the youth made me very happy very happy
3448282 how can our national self respect be so fragile and shallow
3448283 somebody says youre a mob so you curse him even want to beat him and then you say were not a mob this is as if someone said you were a fool so you held up a big sign in front of his girlfriends brothers dog saying i am not a fool the message will get to him but hell still think youre a fool
3448284 however the current young generation turns a blind eye to it ive never seen them respond to those major domestic issues rather they take a utilitarian opportunistic approach
3448285 we accept all the values of human rights of democracy
3448286 we accept that the issue is how to realize it
3448287 june 4th could not and should not succeed at that time if june 4th had succeeded china would be worse and worse not better
3448288 in the nineteen nineties i thought that the chinese government is not good enough maybe we need to set up a better government
3448289 the problem is that we didnt know what a good government would be so we let the chinese communist party stay in place the other problem is we didnt have the power to get them out they have the army
3448290 we really acknowledge him we really think he was brave
3448291 they fought for china to make the country better and there were some faults of the government but finally we must admit that the chinese government had to use any way it could to put down that event
3448292 you eat bread you drink coffee all of these are not brought by democracy indian guys have democracy and some african countries have democracy but they cant feed their own people
3448293 chinese people have begun to think one part is the good life another part is democracy
3448294 if democracy can really give you the good life thats good but without democracy if we can still have the good life why should we choose democracy
3448295 at duke university grace wang a chinese freshman tried to mediate between pro tibet and pro china protesters on campus
3448296 i really dont know where she is and i think its better for me not to know
3448297 when people cant express themselves in real life what can they do they definitely have to express their anger toward someone im far away they dont know me so they dont feel sorry about it they say whatever they want
3448298 this is just like what happened in the cultural revolution
3448299 think about how deng xiaoping was treated at that time and then in just ten years things had changed completely
3448300 the accumulated desire for expression just like when a flood suddenly races into a breach
3448301 are acutely aware that their country whose resurgence they feel and admire has no principle to guide it
3448302 some of them see that liberalism in the west has lost its belief in itself and they turn to leo strauss for conservatism that is based on principle on natural right this conservatism is distinct from a status quo conservatism because they are not satisfied with a country that has only a status quo and not a principle

3448430 democrats have given us the highest taxes in the southeast
3448431 it took very little research to discover that nc has some of the highest taxes in the southeast
3448432 mondays claim from howard wolfson clintons communications director during the campaign that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
3448433 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was
3448434 as the campaign progressed few edwards supporters i knew gave any indication that clinton was their second choice
3448435 in my own caucus which i chaired when our edwards group was initially declared non viable there was discussion of moving but to obama not clinton in the end we gained viability by bringing over richardson and biden forces and by negotiating with the obama group
3448436 an iowa campaign without edwards would have had a totally different dynamic with a different focus on issues with different media coverage for all of the candidates and probably with some breathing room for bill richardson or joe biden
3448437 if youve never been in iowa during a caucus campaign you cant begin to understand how the dynamic works how candidate focused it really is take out one candidate and its an entirely different animal
3448438 clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to do the job from day one

3448446 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
3448447 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
3448448 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
3448449 kids want to think for themselves they dont care what mom and dad say

3448463 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
3448464 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3448465 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line
3448466 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3448467 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3448468 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3448469 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3448470 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3448471 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3448472 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3448473 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3448474 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3448475 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3448476 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3448477 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3448478 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3448479 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3448480 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3448481 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3448482 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3448483 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3448484 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3448485 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3448486 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3448487 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3448488 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3448489 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices

3448494 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3448495 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3448496 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week

3448500 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3448501 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3448502 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3448503 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3448504 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3448505 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3448506 its better that the us do the drilling than china or cuba it will be a lot safer
3448507 he has a voting record to the left of vermont sen bernie sanders and sanders is a socialist
3448508 for me the issue is israel with obama you get louis farrakhan and rev jeremiah wright coming in the back door to the white house
3448509 lord now is the time to send your wisdom and kindness to the tortured who although they have forgotten need you as they hurl themselves closer to the precipice
3448510 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews

3448516 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3448517 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3448518 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3448519 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3448520 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3448521 just so you all know we did set a record
3448522 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3448523 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3448524 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3448525 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3448526 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3448527 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3448528 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3448529 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3448530 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3448531 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3448532 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3448533 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3448534 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3448535 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3448536 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3448537 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3448538 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3448539 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3448543 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3448544 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3448545 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3448546 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3448547 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3448548 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3448549 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3448550 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3448551 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3448552 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3448553 everything our members receive every benefit every right every gain has come from the work of this union over the last 90 years
3448554 thank you to all of you for protecting the most important people in the world to us our families
3448555 thank you for protecting our properties our businesses our jobs
3448556 our primary focus right now is on ensuring the safety and security of our students and fully investigating these allegations which we consider very serious
3448557 in addition to the offices mentioned above the college of liberal arts and sciences and the rape victim advocacy program have worked together to ensure that these allegations are investigated thoroughly fairly and professionally
3448558 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3448559 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3448560 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3448561 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3448562 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3448563 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3448564 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3448565 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3448566 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3448567 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3448568 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3448569 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3448570 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3448571 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3448572 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3448573 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3448574 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3448575 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3448576 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3448577 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3448578 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3448579 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3448580 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3448581 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3448582 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3448583 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3448584 those are words that ring in the american national anthem on american licence plates in the american declaration of independence
3448585 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3448586 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3448587 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3448588 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3448589 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3448590 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3448591 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3448592 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3448593 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3448594 google is slowly but surely gobbling up the search market
3448595 next generation of mobility products with mind blowing designs and exciting new features
3448596 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3448597 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3448598 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3448599 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3448600 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3448601 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3448602 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3448603 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3448604 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3448605 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3448606 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3448607 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3448608 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3448609 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3448610 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3448611 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3448612 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3448613 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3448614 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3448615 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3448616 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3448617 these battleground states are good reflections of the nation as a whole
3448618 the youth vote both religious and non religious are likely to show the same patterns at the national level if they religious youth can have an impact nationally they will have an impact in the battleground states
3448619 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3448620 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3448621 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3448622 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3448623 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3448624 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3448625 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3448626 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3448627 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3448628 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3448629 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3448630 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3448631 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast
3448632 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3448633 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3448634 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3448635 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3448636 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3448637 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3448638 who will be the next president of the united states
3448639 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3448640 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3448641 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3448642 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3448643 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3448644 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3448645 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3448646 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3448647 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3448648 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3448649 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3448650 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3448651 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3448652 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3448653 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3448654 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3448655 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3448656 as the mid 20th century came to a close the german people changed more and more rapidly
3448657 with the election of konrad adenauer in 1949 germans began the fight for world peace and to bring down the final barriers of anti semitism
3448658 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3448659 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3448660 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3448661 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3448662 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3448663 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3448664 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3448665 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3448666 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3448667 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3448668 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3448669 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3448670 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3448671 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3448672 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise

3448684 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3448685 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3448691 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3448692 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3448693 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3448694 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3448695 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3448696 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3448697 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3448698 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3448699 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3448700 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3448701 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3448702 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3448703 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3448704 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3448705 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3448706 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3448707 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3448708 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3448709 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3448710 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3448711 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3448712 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3448713 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3448714 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3448715 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3448716 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3448717 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3448718 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3448719 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3448720 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3448721 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3448722 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3448723 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3448724 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3448725 anyone whos paid attention knows that obama makes many more gaffes than mccain
3448726 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3448727 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3448728 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3448729 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3448730 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3448731 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3448732 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3448733 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3448734 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3448735 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3448736 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3448737 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3448738 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3448739 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3448740 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3448741 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3448742 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3448743 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3448744 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3448745 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3448746 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3448747 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3448748 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3448749 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3448750 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3448751 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3448752 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3448753 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3448754 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3448755 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3448756 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3448757 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3448758 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3448759 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3448760 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3448761 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3448762 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3448763 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3448764 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3448765 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3448766 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3448767 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3448768 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3448769 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3448770 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3448771 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3448772 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3448773 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3448774 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3448775 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3448776 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3448777 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3448778 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3448779 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3448780 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3448781 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3448782 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3448783 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3448784 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3448785 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3448786 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3448787 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3448788 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3448789 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3448790 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3448791 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3448792 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3448793 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3448794 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3448795 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3448796 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3448797 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3448798 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3448799 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3448800 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3448801 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3448802 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3448803 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3448804 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3448805 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3448806 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3448807 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3448808 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3448809 the fact that theyve been able to develop a polymer type material that can be used in a relatively thin film is worth a second look compared with previous ceramic heatsinks that worked the same way
3448810 also its working in a temperature range that is of interest to us
3448811 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
3448812 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3448813 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3448814 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3448815 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3448816 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3448817 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3448818 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3448819 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3448820 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3448821 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3448822 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3448823 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3448824 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3448825 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3448826 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3448827 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3448828 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3448829 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3448830 cutting extreme poverty around the world in half by 2015
3448831 so the key to the upcoming election is whether white voters will be more less or equally likely to vote for obama as for kerry i believe the answer is less likely
3448832 just as the american revolution inspired mahatma gandhi to free a great people
3448833 even if you dont like both candidates you should vote for someone because if you dont then you have no business complaining for the next 4 years you did not allow your voice to be heard
3448834 does a governorship have more credibility than congressman or senator
3448835 the average age of elected presidents since 1952 the era of televised politics is 56
3448836 mccain is scare mongering and creating fear in americans just as weve seen republicans do in the last 8 years fear seems to work which is why they are doing it again get scared of the black guy etc etc very old politics of mcbush mcsame
3448837 what i think it boils down to is are the democrats just as motivated for obama in 08 as they were with an
3448838 please tell me a mccain policy that is not in line with bush
3448839 i think it was one of those memos that was written looked at by the candidate and wisely discarded
3448840 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3448841 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters and then produces a strategy that all through the summer and into the fall and almost up to iowa is cautious calculating triangulating and is basically a replica of president clintons 1996 reelection strategy when he had no competitive primaries i mean its undeniable that she ran on inevitability she ran as the candidate of the establishment she ran as a quasi incumbent in a year of change it was a terrible mistake so if mark penn understood what the targets were in march maybe they should have come up with a strategy that would have reached those targets
3448842 campaign it seems from these memos to have been at least as focused on the staff going after each other as they were on going after the nomination and getting past barack obama
3448843 by the way one thing we shouldnt ignore in all of this they can all stand around pointing fingers at each other theyre not pointing fingers at the one person who deserves the most blame for their defeat and that is barack obama
3448844 he was an extraordinary candidate who resonated with what america feels and felt and what democrats felt as he went through those primaries
3448845 theres a certain strength in the sense of centeredness and almost the serenity that the obama campaign has displayed
3448846 they have a strategy theyve executed it consistently they dont get thrown off by day to day polls i remember last september there were all these people who were saying obama is behind clinton hes got to go out and hes got to attack her hes got to run negative ads and some of his own people and fundraising people said that and he held a conference call and he said im not doing that i know what the strategy is i know what i want to say i know how to reach people now ill tell you something youre a lot better off in a campaign with a strategy consistently adhered to than with 20 people debating ten competing strategies moving day to day
3448847 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3448848 barry and his 300 advisors are no match for putin hed spin the junior senator like a top and play him like a fiddle
3448849 barack obama while on vacation still managed to handle the crisis between russia and georgia better than trigger happy mccain john mccain was ready to wage war with russia because he thought that they attacked atlanta if he had any soldiers in his army after his brilliant surge in iraq he could send them to fight russia
3448850 it took the race card to defeat the clintons and they resent the hell out of it
3448851 hillary fought a tough battle made mistakes that cost the nomination
3448852 it was written well before he went into politics and it was not ghost written
3448853 why are people still arguing about hillary and obama this entire election will boil down to one factor race like bob kerrey said if obama was a tall skinny white guy named paul jones the election is a different story
3448854 is there anything obama can learn from this story and these memos
3448855 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters
3448856 there is a huge shift taking place in the global awareness in the last 5 years with strong views about globalization and the power structures of major corporations

3448869 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3448870 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3448871 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3448872 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3448873 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares

3448883 of all the housemates he wants to be here the least and when someone does feel that way it makes it harder to get on with them in the house
3448884 shes not really bothered about being on big brother if she was she would have auditioned for her its just a chance to be with her boyfriend but you cant just come in at the end and reap all the benefits and rewards from it
3448885 i dont trust her id say shes devious she doesnt actually say some things she makes you feel uncomfortable with the way she is acting its all a game she creates rows i think
3448886 hes very arrogant and controlling within the house i do wonder what rex is doing here i do feel that he still looks down on people
3448887 rex has been really really bad to live with from day one hes bossed people about hes been nasty hes tried to brew up arguments hes been banging on for the last eight weeks about how bored he is and how much he wants his girlfriend and all theyve really done since arriving in the house is bicker
3448888 although shes good fun its just all a bit of glamour in this house for her and i think generally she doesnt even enjoy it nicole is very very selfish
3448889 i just dont really agree with the way he handles things especially today being nasty and stirring up little comments i dont think he deserves to be here the way he keeps going on about how he wants to go home
3448890 i just feel like she licks kats a e the whole time they sing together they just do everything together and i do believe its because rachel believes that kats going to win and its an easy way to get into the final

3448900 the excellence of the holy quran over all other expressions is like the excellence of allah over his creation
3448901 bring out thy people from thedepths of darkness into light and teach them to remember the days of allah
3448902 ye verily will work corruption in the earth twice and ye will become great tyrants
3448903 so when the time for the first of the two came we roused against you slaves of oursof great might who ravaged your country and it was a threat performed
3448904 then we gave you once again your turn against them and we aided you with wealthand children and made you more in soldiery saying if ye do good ye do good foryour own souls and if ye do evil it is for them in like manner
3448905 so when the time for the second of the judgments came we roused against youothers of our slaves to ravage you and to enter the temple even as they entered itthe first time and to lay waste all that they conquered with an utter wasting
3448906 it may be that your lord will have mercy on you
3448907 but if ye repeat the crime we shall repeat the punishment
3448908 and when they felt our might behold them fleeing from it
3448909 but it was said unto them flee not but return to that existence which emasculatedyou and to your dwellings that ye may be questioned
3448910 and verity we have written in the psalms after the reminder my righteous slaveswill inherit the earth
3448911 they are those who if we establish them in the land establish regular prayer andgive regular charity enjoin the right and forbid wrong with allah rests the end anddecision of all affairs
3448912 if such were our will we could send down to them from the sky a sign to whichthey would bend their necks in humility
3448913 is not he best who answereth the wronged one when he crieth unto him andremoveth the evil and hath made you viceroys inheritors of the earth
3448914 and whoso defendeth himself after he hath suffered wrong for such there is no way of blame against them
3448915 the blame is only against those who oppress mankind and wrongfully rebel in theearth for such there is a painful penalty
3448916 fain would they put out the light of allah with their mouths but allah will perfect hislight however much the disbelievers are averse
3448917 at length when they see with their own eyes that which they are promised
3448918 then will they know who it is that is weakest in his helper and least important inpoint of numbers
3448919 say have ye thought if all your water were to disappear into the earth who thencould bring you gushing water
3448920 he it is who hath sent his messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that he may cause it to prevail over all religion however much the idolaters may beaverse
3448921 oh but i call to witness the planets that recede the stars which rise and hide
3448922 alif lam mim this is the scripture whereof there is no doubt a guidance unto thosewho ward off evil who believe in the unseen
3448923 why is not a sign sent down to him muhammad from his lord
3448924 know ye all that allah giveth life to the earth after its death
3448925 we have made clear our revelations for you that ye may learn and understand
3448926 allah hath promised such of you as believe and do good works that he will surelymake them khalifas to succeed in the earth even as he caused those who werebefore them to succeed others
3448927 and that he will surely establish for them their religion which he hath approved for them a will give them in exchange safety after their fear
3448928 and we desired to show favor unto those who were oppressed in the earth and tomake them leaders in faith imam and to make them the inheritors
3448929 we the ahle bait are the oppressed ones referred to in this verse
3448930 that they become not as those who received the scripture of old but the term wasprolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened and many of them areevil livers
3448931 such days of varying fortunes we give to men and men by turns
3448932 this day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion
3448933 and an announcement from allah and his apostle to the people on the day of thegreat pilgrimage that allah and his apostle
3448934 fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together
3448935 and verily we will make them taste the lower punishment before the greater
3448936 that when our revelations are recited unto him he saith mere fables of the men ofold
3448937 every soul will be held in pledge for its own deeds except the companions of theright hand
3448938 they will ask one another and ask of the guilty what hath brought you to thisburning
3448939 it is he who has sent his apostle with guidance and the religion of truth that hemay proclaim it over all religions
3448940 truth has arrived and falsehood perished for falsehood is bound toperish
3448941 soon we shall show them our signs on the horizons and within themselves
3448942 until it will be manifest unto them that it is the truth
3448943 until when they see the promised warning of allah being fulfilled either inpunishment or in the approach of the hour
3448944 they will at length realize who is worst in position
3448945 and has made his bounties flow to you in exceeding measure both seen andunseen
3448946 we give him increase in its harvest and whoso desireth the harvest of the world we give him thereof and he hath no portion in the hereafter
3448947 even though the markets have been sketchy at best youve seen the volumes on the online broker side pretty much hold up
3448948 they have better risk management strategies and customers are embracing options and stop orders
3448949 if weve learned anything from history smart people are trading now the people who learned nothing are selling out the people who understand the market are buying
3448950 you can throw as many bells and whistles as you want at traders but you ultimately have to head multi asset

3448978 in the middle of the season when the ratings dipped a little before they went back up i think that maybe we lost some people
3448979 there were some episodes that were very heavy mythology episodes and very heavily serialized i would say that these episodes this year are a little bit more self contained than our episodes were last year
3448980 people seemed to make terrible comments i have gigantic biceps this season
3448981 what i can tell you is that both the show and the movie take certain inspiration from the terminator mythology and certain themes you know that are important like the value of self sacrifice and perseverance and faith
3448982 but when we in the premiere of our show deposited sarah connor in the present day we instantly created a new timeline in the mythology so in that way you know the experience that our audience has watching sarah connor can only be seen on the television show
3448983 you have to look at things differently when youre on a series like this
3448984 we are very guarded about what we do on the show
3448985 the actors dont even know what were doing until they get their scripts
3448986 people always choose to say something to me when im at the pharmacy the produce section or the airport

3449012 this election may well come down to which candidate can better control his crazy pastors and after yesterdays weirdness at the convention center mccain has fallen behind by about two cubits
3449013 stotts ignores that hagees new apparent defense of his inflammatory remarks and more specifically his claim that his critics do not understand the bible view seems to contradict his previous retraction of them
3449014 as a believing christian i see the hand of god in everything that happens here on earth both the blessings and the curses but ultimately neither i nor any other person can know the mind of god concerning hurricane katrina i should not have suggested otherwise no matter what the cause of the storm my heart goes out to all who suffered in this terrible tragedy there but for the grace of god go any one of us
3449015 it is deeply troubling to pick up a newspaper and read sweeping condemnations of things you did in fact say but which are not new or controversial to those who believe in an all powerful god who is sovereign and intervenes in human history
3449016 is hagee now un retracting his retractions and standing by his attacks on catholics and gays once again it appears so why didnt stotts notice that
3449017 as some in the media sought to play us one against the other we did something the media was not expecting we acted like christians we sat down together brother to brother and talked as a result of those meetings we developed a friendship we developed a greater understanding and now christians united for israel has formed a new alliance were honored to have with us tonight some of the most important catholic lay leaders in america and they have brought many of their friends with them
3449018 we have promised that in the future were going to open the borders of our tent and bring the catholics who are pro israel to this event and celebrate our union because we are brothers and sisters in the faith
3449019 perhaps because she was too busy trying to decouple hagee from mccain even though prominent mccain supporter joe lieberman was a featured speaker at hagees cufi event
3449020 would stotts let obama get away with barack obama for instance claiming that a close adviser who say spoke at an event that also featured rev

3449151 yesterday federal prosecutors in new york alleged that siddiquis activism had become extremism us officials say that the 36 year old mother of three became an al qaeda operative who ended up in afghanistan and attacked us soldiers who had come to interrogate her
3449152 intelligence officials believe that siddiqui considered the worlds most wanted female before her arrest became affiliated with al qaeda while in boston though the fbi had sought her in 2003 she returned to her native pakistan with her children and went underground before agents found her according to interviews with us officials and documents from the fbi and the director of national intelligence
3449153 us officials say she eluded them until last month when she was arrested with an unidentified teenage boy in ghazni afghanistan local police caught the two outside the provincial governors compound with chemicals maps and documents on explosives according to court papers
3449154 they were here for suicide bombing an afghan official in ghazni told the globe in a telephone interview last week
3449155 around the time she graduated from mit in 1995 siddiqui married muhammad khan an anesthesiologist from karachi who became a resident at brigham and womens hospital in boston at first the couple seemed happy hosting friends for meals in their apartment on st alphonsus street in roxbury
3449156 shortly after her marriage siddiqui gave birth to a son and bore a daughter maram bint muhammad in september 1998 at st
3449157 in the spring of 2002 months after the sept 11 terrorist attacks fbi agents questioned the couple about their purchase of night vision goggles body armor and military instruction manuals according to sharp months later the family returned to pakistan where siddiqui and khan divorced just before the birth of their third child according to sharp
3449158 siddiqui then married an al qaeda operative known as ammar al baluchi the nephew of khalid sheikh mohammed the alleged mastermind of the sept 11 attacks according to documents from the director of national intelligence
3449159 in march 2003 mohammed was arrested in a predawn raid in islamabad he and baluchi were held for years in secret us detention and are now awaiting trial at guantanamo bay within weeks of mohammeds arrest siddiquis photo appeared on the fbi website as a person wanted for questioning
3449160 with her whereabouts unknown sketchy reports in pakistani papers suggested that she had been arrested in pakistan and was turned over to the americans prompting anti us protests in pakistan amnesty international listed siddiqui as possibly among the ghost prisoners held in secret by the us government her anguished mother traveled to the united states in search of clues
3449161 but yesterday us officials vehemently denied that siddiqui had been in american custody until her recent arrest
3449162 dean boyd a justice department spokesman called the allegations absolutely baseless and false a cia spokesman also denied that she had been detained
3449163 for several years we have had no information regarding her whereabouts whatsoever said gregory sullivan a state department spokesman on south asian affairs

3449181 i think it was big every time we get the ball were trying to score were always telling ourselves make big plays we were able to connect and make a big play its definitely a booster for the offense get some momentum swinging on our side the defense was playing great whenever we can contribute and make a big play thats always good
3449182 we think we can be a lot better i think a lot better in every category obviously tonight there was times where we felt we played alright and then the bengals first group we let them drive on us toward the end and score so that was disappointing for us but we talk about all the time about being consistent stopping the run and tonight we didnt get that done as much as we can but we took a couple small steps forward at times and we have a quick turnaround going to san fran next week so were going to make sure we take the positives and take it into next week
3449183 of course i think this defense our expectations that we set for ourselves is very high we feel like the skys the limit for the number of impact plays we can make turnovers everything we can do we feel like we can set the tone of the game we want to do that and set our offense up to score some points
3449184 i thought aaron did a number of solid things there was a lot of productivity on offense i didnt like the start of the whole offense as a unit on the first series with a false start we had a mental error that resulted in a sack and we had a dropped ball for an interception but other than that i liked the tempo i thought the productivity was there i thought aaron did a good job with the mechanical part of the game i thought he threw the ball off his back foot with accuracy i liked his decisiveness i thought he put together a good performance for us to build off of now theres going to be things im sure tomorrow as there always is its a preseason game number one but well correct it accordingly and build on the positive and fix the things that need to be corrected
3449185 i would think its a starting point for both of our rookies we knew coming into the preseason that we had a lot of work to do there there are going to be things from my vantage point that brian brohm did some really good things from the game and well build off of that he was in a bad spot there on his first play of the game with the interception the route progression wasnt what it was supposed to be and thats something where you have to have the discipline to move on to the next receiver he will definitely learn from that situation but once again the productivity was there was it clean no it wasnt clean but theres a number of factors going on well get that cleaned up and i think it was a very good first solid first step for the whole quarterback position
3449186 i think it went pretty well i did some good things out there made some plays the receivers did a great job james jones had a fantastic catch donald driver breaking tackles and i think the line protected for the most part very well there were some mistakes out there weve got to clean them up and hopefully get better for saturday
3449187 it felt great its nice when you throw not a great pass and youve got a guy who can catch it break two tackles lose the helmet and score a touchdown
3449188 it was a good night the reception from the fans the signs i saw in the stands were very positive and encouraging
3449189 ive always felt like weve got the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett favre or management or whatever it was a great reception when we took the field and when we scored the touchdown the fans were in it the whole game and it feels great to be able to look up in the stands and see the support and the signs and stuff it definitely means a lot to you
3449190 it definitely had a different atmosphere we had 70 000 fans couldnt get the camera out of my face in pregame it was all over me it definitely had a different feel but we prepared the same way as any other game
3449191 barnett was last year and will be again the best player on this team he is everywhere barnett kampmann driver tauscher clifton tt is such a genious for drafting those studs
3449192 green bay the packers are announcing the starters on defense which means any chances of aaron rodgers getting booed will have to wait until he takes the field
3449193 green bay the result a loss of 7 yards wasnt pretty but it wasnt all bad for aaron rodgers on his first drive
3449194 a false start from his offensive line put the team back 5 yards on the first play rodgers had a nice conservative completion to james jones on the second play rodgers was then sacked but it was all brandon jacksons fault as he totally whiffed on his assignment and then on third down rodgers fired a pass that should have been caught by donald driver for a first down but driver bobbled it and then dropped it
3449195 sundog if youre ripping on rodgers for leading martin into coverage no one hung receivers out to dry more than favre those receivers were getting killed in the middle for many years ask donald driver
3449196 shermans lucky he had the team he inherited because he ran it into the ground and i dont care about the regular season record they had no heart and yes including favre during shermans years that was completely evident in the horrible home playoff losses year after year to far inferior teams
3449197 obviously tonight there was times where we felt we played alright
3449198 also sundog its a good thing packers have plenty of fans like jj which is also why packers have the best fans in the entire nfl
3449199 also it is proven fact and everyone knows green bay has the best fans any nfl player would say so and everyone would agree
3449200 actually if you ever got outside wi you would realize that the general consensus of gb fans is that they are the least football savvy fans in the nfl
3449201 also another noticeable concept all rodgers passes almost set up his recievers for big hits sure it looks great works at times but that will become pretty hard your team doesent have a lot of depth at a lot of positions
3449202 how many great seasons in the nfl did they have

3449221 if you receive the order to cease fire this would not mean that we would stop all operations including reconnaissance operations
3449222 that makes it clear that the targets of the russian military were not only georgian economic objects but international objects on georgian territory

3449349 im joining a big club in the premier league this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well they play very good football and had a fantastic season
3449350 so i am very happy to come here with the opportunity to play in the premier league we are also playing in europe this season so that will be good
3449351 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here
3449352 i follow premier league football because at this moment i think it is the best league in the world so it is good to play my football here
3449353 the football here is very offensive and the most honest in europe players here are strong and it is a very difficult league
3449354 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3449355 i won the scottish cup last season and it would be nice to win a trophy with aston ville here in england we have a very good team and could get some trophies
3449356 the uefa cup run with rangers last season was a fantastic experience even though we lost the final it was an amazing experience and playing in a european final was a great moment in my career
3449357 in germany we always said the biggest thing to win is the league title because it is a competition for the whole season so we are looking for this title and also the champions league
3449358 we have a big target to win not just one title but go for all four so we need a big squad

3449362 but if you have no improvement then thats difficult and so i was very happy after i came back in december to play and come so close to a title
3449363 the confidence among the players is as high as i have known
3449364 every player has looked back at last season and seen how close we were despite the injuries and everything that happened
3449365 we have improved the squad with the players we have signed and everyone has improved as players as well i think this year will be our season

3449455 but never mind if you look into the bag for the one that is left you will be able to tell which pebble i picked
3449456 when i planted the fern and the bamboo seeds i took very good care of them i gave them light i gave them water the fern quickly grew from the earth its brilliant green covered the floor yet nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo in the second year the fern grew more vibrant and plentiful and again nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo
3449457 in the third year there was still nothing from the bamboo seed but i would not quit
3449458 then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant but just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall it had spent the five years growing roots those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive i would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle
3449459 did you know my child that all this time you have been struggling you have actually been growing roots i would not quit on the bamboo i will never quit on you dont compare yourself to others
3449460 the bamboo had a different purpose than the fern yet they both make the forest beautiful

3449497 that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences

3449499 directives on the use of the name of god in the sacred liturgy
3449500 some impact on the use of particular pieces of liturgical music in our country as well as in the composition of variable texts such as the general intercessions for the celebration of the mass and the other sacraments
3449501 ask them to try to come up with alternate language
3449502 it may take time for people to get used to singing something different
3449503 an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the name of god in daily life emphasizing the power of language as an act of devotion and worship
3449504 by directive of the holy father in accord with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith this congregation deems it convenient to communicate to the bishops conferences as regards the translation and the pronunciation in a liturgical setting of the divine name signified in the sacred tetragrammaton
3449505 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god it was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord
3449506 avoiding pronouncing the tetragrammaton of the name of god on the part of the church has therefore its own grounds
3449507 apart from a motive of a purely philological order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
3449508 the name of almighty god expressed by the hebrew tetragrammaton and rendered in latin by the word dominus is to be rendered into any given vernacular by a word equivalent in meaning
3449509 notwithstanding such a clear norm in recent years the practice has crept in of pronouncing the god of israels proper name
3449510 the practice of vocalizing it is met with both in the reading of biblical texts taken from the lectionary as well as in prayers and hymns and it occurs in diverse written and spoken forms

3449512 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3449513 im not sure that obama will actually pursue the same kind of idea that we had inserted in the platform
3449514 i think we will have to pursue our congressional representatives to bring legislation forward
3449515 to say youre going to provide affordable coverage to people is not the same as giving them health care
3449516 just because you have insurance coverage does not guarantee you access to the care that you and your doctor decide you need and people with insurance understand that
3449517 ensuring that americans have access to affordable high quality health care
3449518 for 50 years the democratic party has been engaged in a battle to provide the kind of health care a great nation owes its people
3449519 we believe that health care is a right and not a privilege

3449523 but part of building a team for our customers of course requires us to find the team
3449524 we went into the conference room where the rest of the magicimage odc team a total of six was sitting and dialed into a u s bridge
3449525 by listening to the discussion i could tell both teams understood the system equally well and had formed a close relationship
3449526 he took me to the magicimages odc area where vivian explained to me how the complex system works i didnt understand much
3449527 the process involves requirements specifications system modeling and analysis design build test iteration project acceptance and delivery and postmortem

3449593 obviamente el p blico no toma esto como una evoluci n de la comprensi n cient fica objetiva sino como una proliferaci n de opiniones contradictorias
3449594 las palabras que usamos rutinariamente los cient ficos para expresar la incertidumbre se separan para hacer art culos con m s gancho y m s fuertes
3449595 transmiten significado a los lectores no solo en ese art culo de prensa sino de manera m s general acerca de que la ciencia es menos exacta de lo que normalmente se dice
3449596 creo que nos hemos hecho m s sensibles a la necesidad de una revisi n cr tica de los art culos de investigaci n que probablemente iniciar n o mantendr n el tipo de controversia que produce un efecto l tigo
3449597 el ejemplo de reducir las p rdidas debidas a huracanes es v lido

3449599 lo mismo podr a decirse de de muchos estudios sobre la salud referidos a las grasas el caf o los carbohidratos

3449601 en esta esfera p blica se supone que predominar n las mejores argumentaciones respaldadas por evidencias cient ficas s lidas
3449602 el p blico general tiene que dar un paso adelante en los t rminos de la literatura cient fica y pol tica en los del compromiso con la educaci n y un liderazgo pol tico eficaz y fuerte y en los de su propia mejora general
3449603 in the days and weeks ahead i will continue to reach out to colleagues in the senate and leaders throughout louisiana to build a unified effort for the important general election race ahead the stakes couldnt be higher we face tough challenges both at home and abroad and sen obama has my full support for meeting them

3449612 far too much is made each year of a percentage point or two up or down in the key stage 3 results in english mathematics and science
3449613 what is important is that the trend is upwards reflecting the rising standards in schools across the country
3449614 too much importance is placed on key stage 3 tests which are no more than a progress check two thirds of the way through secondary education
3449615 the key stage 3 tests are an irrelevance no one will be interested in the results when young people apply for a job

3449632 you are directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate
3449633 i think that one of the reasons i got this letter was to intimidate me

3449814 rudy has good height and appears to use it that quickness almost makes him seem rangy as expected he moved well without the ball when the sets called for it he also showed good speed up and down the court his shot and release were quick as well both in decision making and execution he doesnt let grass grow under his feet when there are points to be had hes also fast getting up in the air one of the problems plaguing the current blazer leapers is that their rim finishes take a long time to develop rudy appeared to get in the sky in a hurry i dont have many doubts about him being able to get shots up in the nba everything thats good about him happens fast
3449815 the worst part of rudys game by far was his defense which aside for a couple noticeable moments ranged from a high of semi adequate to a low of wholly ineffective he was reaching leaning and getting beat off of the dribble with regularity in the first quarter he got a little more active in the second quarter but still ended up getting to the spot late getting out of position and or playing with his arms instead of his feet
3449816 the most impressive aspect of rudys game and probably the game overall was the way he took over when the spanish made their comeback in the fourth those two drives against yao ming were priceless he picked that team up and carried them on his back others would come along and add to the win but rudy did it first brilliant you could tell how much the coach was relying on him as well by the minutes he got
3449817 i still drool over how well rudy moves without the ball no matter how many cuts i see him make if the other blazers will recognize the potential there and take care to get him the ball oh boy this showcases his quickness more than any other aspect of the game
3449818 that workout maybe brought out a few flaws in his game and i think it maybe scared him szczerbiak said
3449819 so even though he was on everybodys radar he decided not to go into the draft
3449820 he had to learn to put the ball on the floor a few years ago and he has worked on that aspect of the game to the point where the team can give him the ball and ask him to create and make a shot in a game winning situation
3449821 the horse is really young and im really pleased with him as he has never seen anything like this before

3449864 you have no ability to demand that delivery drivers such as fed ex and ups obtain signatures at the door when delivering alcohol youd better just ban wine shipping all together

3449867 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3449868 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3449869 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3449870 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3449871 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3449872 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3449873 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3449874 now theyre reading the sides of the foods and drinks for sugar content
3449875 without a healthy work force to support the ag industry will suffer
3449876 just by talking about it does in some ways change behaviors
3449877 we dont know what they suffer from and how they solve their health issues so the goal is to find that out
3449878 a large well funded study like ours will be read by those who have the power to make changes politicians policy makers health professionals and so forth
3449879 at the beginning people were scared and didnt want to open their doors
3449880 i always stayed away from those kinds of foods but now with the information even more so
3449881 many times they go to the consulate and they dont know where to go
3449882 the shares of applied materials have been stuck in a 6 trading range for the past five years
3449883 this in part reflects a slowdown in growth in the semiconductor industry and a greater ability of applieds customers to use the same equipment to achieve better results
3449884 solar prospects remain bright but until solar becomes more of a growth driver for the company we would remain on the sidelines
3449885 ill have a good week training and look forward to playing newcastle sundays game was too soon for me to start but it was good to get out there were all looking forward to the first game of the season
3449886 ive never really taken penalties throughout my career but i took one at aberdeen and ive scored in penalty shoot outs if a penalty comes up id step up no problem
3449887 its still early days the performances are there and were creating the chances
3449888 since the first game back against aberdeen weve all progressed and got better with every game
3449889 we believe for the longer term it is better off keeping the business intact and as an alternative perhaps consider selling a minority interest to private equity investors as just one example
3449890 lehman has illiquid asset exposures and we believe tough headwinds persist even after reducing exposures meaningfully in the second quarter
3449891 one of the things that lehman has been very cognizant of that we cant say has necessarily been the case with several of its peers is getting in and out of businesses depending on what point of an equity or fixed income cycle we are in

3449893 i can get you on a flight back from chicago
3449894 as such we believe the slot win and slot hold percentage was artificially high this month
3449895 after adjusting for this issue results on the strip were down 5 1 year over year
3449896 reflect the impact of a slowing economy on travel to and spend on the strip
3449897 when it stops is tough to forecast with any great precision though we think this continues through the summer
3449898 clearly a lot of investors have discounted what this company is all about
3449899 the third quarter may be kind of tough and trends will down year over year but we own and manage this business for the long term
3449900 we are holding up a better than i think people give us credit for
3449901 are feeling the impact of the weakening economy and a slowdown in consumer spending during the third quarter
3449902 the strips performance is cyclical and is dependent on a stronger macroeconomic environment to return to the type of consistent growth it has exhibited over the past several years
3449903 on the positive side it appears that trends at wynn las vegas and many of the higher end oriented properties have continued to hold up better than most of the strips mass market oriented properties which have experienced more substantial revenue declines
3449904 we expect broad domestic economic weakness to weigh on gaming trends into 2009
3449905 with exposure to regional economies in texas and louisiana which we believe could benefit from a booming energy industry and or rebuilding efforts
3449906 the combination of slower u s and global oil consumption growth increased production capacity for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and higher non opec supply raises the prospect for a drop in demand for opec crude oil and an increase in surplus capacity
3449907 pues s m s el formar li el cap dels xiquets i no donar li els coneixements i ja est es formen com a persones s n independents s n es saben buscar la vida li donen si a cas els instruments a labast que li fan falta al xiquet per a buscar se daix per s n ells els qui sho treballen o veuen la necessitat daprendre a o all no li ho donen escudellat
3449908 s una q esti personal per jo crec que s una q esti m s de fons una manera de carregar se una escola valenciana una escola de funcionament democr tic on no sha callat res on els alumnes ixen lliures no
3449909 una s per conforme treballem en esta escola i perqu ell s lluitador ell no es d na per ven ut perqu vol millorar leducaci p blica i aix molesta ells volen des de conselleria trobe volen dominar ho tot
3449910 jo pense que els tres les tres caracter stiques que he dit de lescola sembla que no deu de ser que no agraden no a la conselleria actual no solament la valencianitzaci sin tamb la part que he comentat de participaci i democr cia i la part duna de fer una actitud cr tica de cara a all que s el sistema educatiu la renovaci pedag gica
3449911 s una persona molt valenta i s una persona molt ambiciosa de cara als seus alumnes i de cara a la seua escola i aix de vegades pues ladministraci fa determinades accions en les que pareix que no que no t massa en compte el donar una escola realment de qualitat
3449912 el que desitgem a banda de les q estions personals que no s n tan importants s que tornem a una legislaci en qu la democr cia es fa a es fa a realitat mitjan ant la voluntat dels consells escolars de les ampa i dels sindicats
3449913 que ja est b de les lleis autorit ries que volem democr cia a lescola que no pintem fava els pares ja no pintem res amb estos dos decrets nous que ha tret no se mos contempla per a res i que lleven eixa llei era vol em fer nos notar
3449914 pues se trata m s de formar la mente de los ni os que no de darles los conocimientos y ya est se forman como personas son independientes son se saben buscar la vida se les da si acaso los instrumentos a su alcance que le hacen falta al ni o para buscar eso pero son ellos quienes lo trabajan o ven la necesidad de aprender esto o aquello no se lo dan masticado
3449915 casi como lo hacen en la universidad no en la universidad hay clases magistrales pero las hay que no son magistrales donde te dan elementos para que puedas navegar por internet y buscar t la informaci n pero eso ya hace veinte a os que pasaba en almoines no hab a internet pero te daban los medios para buscar esa informaci n
3449916 es una cuesti n personal pero yo creo que es una cuesti n m s de fondo una manera de cargarse una escuela valenciana una escuela de funcionamiento democr tico donde no se ha callado nada donde los alumnos salen libres no
3449917 un motivo es por c mo trabajamos en este colegio y porque l es luchador l no se da por vencido porque quiere mejorar la educaci n p blica y eso molesta ellos quieren desde conseller a creo quieren dominarlo todo
3449918 yo creo que los tres las tres caracter sticas que he citado de la escuela parece que no debe ser que no gustan no a la conselleria actual no solamente la valencianizaci n sino tambi n la parte que he comentado de participaci n y democracia y la parte de una de tener una actitud cr tica frente a lo que es el sistema educativo la renovaci n pedag gica
3449919 es una persona muy valiente y una persona muy ambiciosa respecto a sus alumnos y a su colegio y eso a veces pues la administraci n hace determinadas acciones en las que parece que no que no tiene demasiado en cuenta el dar una escuela realmente de calidad
3449920 lo que deseamos aparte de las cuestiones personales que no son tan importantes es que volvamos a una legislaci n en que la democraci se haga se haga realidad a trav s de la voluntad de los consejos escolares de las ampa y de los sindicatos
3449921 ya est bien de leyes autoritarias queremos democracia en la escuela que no pintamos nada los padres ya no pintamos nada con estos dos nuevos decretos que han sacado no se nos contempla para nada y que quiten esa ley quer amos hacernos notar
3449922 the basic reason for china closing the gap is that growth in the u s economy has essentially been zero over the last year and will continue to struggle over the next year
3449923 the basic reason is that growth in the u s economy has essentially been zero over the last year and will continue to struggle over the next year
3449924 we know that china is a big manufacturing giant now
3449925 what this study suggests is that it will continue to play an increasingly larger role
3449926 the expanding market in china is more likely to open up greater opportunities for the u s as well as other producers
3449927 in many ways it has to do with the weakening u s economy
3449928 it also shows how china is a key player in the global economy and that china is not invulnerable to global trends
3449929 china needs exports markets as the global economy slows china needs to make sure that consumers are going to buy its goods
3449930 these cost pressures might mean it will take longer to outstrip the u s in manufacturing

3449960 fife police have led the way on many new initiatives such as test purchasing which is tackling the sale of alcohol to underage youngsters and i have had many parents tell me how pleased they are with the blue light disco initiatives
3449961 i am fully aware that anti social behaviour crime and the fear of crime continue to be concerns for my constituents and that is why i was keen to hear what is happening on the front line
3449962 the important message is that we have all got a part to play and it is important to report crime and disorder if you come across it
3449963 fife polices commitment to partnership working is very evident at the community level where they are actively engaged with local schools community groups local councillors and are leading the co ordination of a multi service approach to making our communities safer
3449964 i support this approach and i am impressed by the enthusiasm for community policing by officers at every level
3449965 it was a pleasure meeting the prime minister today and a valuable opportunity to discuss the issues that matter most to the people of fife
3449966 fife constabulary is addressing these concerns and has adopted a number of innovative approaches in building safer communities
