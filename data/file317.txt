3170000 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
3170001 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
3170002 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3170003 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3170004 the main reason why i attended this session was because my friend was on the panel the concept and discussions around this session were pretty basic questions on how affiliate networks manage their programs run incentive programs and also how they are viewed by affiliates in between sessions i found some time to hit the exhibit floor and meet with some new people and companies i found that the short amount of time i spent on the exhibit floor networking with others proved a lot more beneficial and knowledgable than attending a few of these sessions unfortunately the majority of whats being discussed seemed to be so introductory and such basic information after this session i attended one more but it seemed to keep the same tone and non informational concept so i skipped out early on this is when i then headed to the exhibit floor and made some nice contacts after hitting the exhibit floor i headed back to the hotel then made my way back to the last session of the day ppc super affiliate strategies you must know
3170005 united has gone from being the finest airline in the world with the best route structure and safety record to a shell of its former self
3170006 u s corporations are moving their executive pensions into their regular employee pension funds to take advantage of tax breaks of course were very concerned that this may be happening at the boeing company and we and employees need to know if it is indeed happening
3170007 pensions will be a issue in our upcoming talks with the boeing company management has already indicated that they would like to do away with the traditional pension plan if indeed they were successful in doing away with that it would be a major takeaway for employees and our union has already made it very clear that we will not stand for the traditional pension going away
3170008 i have sent my grits jewelry to government officials as well as various celebrities
3170009 no two pieces are exactly alike as some dry flat while others curl somewhat when they dry
3170010 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3170011 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3170012 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3170013 i want people to see things on our show that makes them think differently about their lives to be a light for people to make a difference to open their minds and see things differently how to get in touch with the spiritual part of their life

3170023 program which has the overall goal of landing astronauts on the moon by 2020 lockheed martin corp which is developing the orion spacecraft and united technologies corp company which are working on new rockets
3170024 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
3170025 we may never know how much money fred baron spent to cover up the story of john edwards affair but covering up is nothing new for the asbestos lawsuit king
3170026 baron routinely makes huge campaign contributions to groups with names like texas values and public justice to hide the truth from voters that the funding comes from the wealth he acquired as a personal injury trial lawyer
3170027 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
3170028 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
3170029 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
3170030 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns
3170031 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
3170032 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach we want to have a whole tool bag full of methods any and all methods that are effective and safe and i view falconry as one method that could have some use
3170033 obviously we are very pleased with the companys strong earnings thus far in 2008 and particularly in the second quarter
3170034 as was announced at the time the membership of usw local 11 0001 which represents union employees at the east boulder mine ratified a new four year labor agreement on july 8 2008 without experiencing any labor interruption
3170035 at june 30 2008 the last of our outstanding forward sales commitments covering a substantial portion of our mined platinum production finally settled out the company entered into these forward sales commitments several years ago in order to protect the company against a decline in platinum prices while we were spending heavily to re establish the developed state of the mines as the price of platinum continued to rise though they have cost us substantially over the past couple of years losses on these forward hedging transactions reduced our sales revenues by 5 8 million in the second quarter and 12 8 million in the first half of 2008 at present we have no plans for any further hedging of our mine production
3170036 mine production in this years second quarter at 126 200 ounces was a little below last years second quarter production
3170037 the companys total cash costs per pgm ounce produced 1 averaged 394 in the second quarter of 2008 quite a bit higher than the 320 per ounce in last years second quarter more than half of this increase was attributable to higher operating costs particularly for power and contractor services and the remainder to lower mine production in the second quarter of 2008 compared to last years second quarter our initial guidance for 2008 full year total cash costs was between 355 and 375 per ounce in view of our reduced production forecast for 2008 along with record high energy prices we have revised our earlier guidance for 2008 total cash costs we now believe total cash costs for 2008 will fall in the range of 380 to 395 per ounce
3170038 operationally progress continues on our mine transformation efforts safety and environmental performance continued strong during the quarter we have implemented recommendations from a third party safety audit conducted during the first quarter that are intended to help drive our incident rates toward zero construction is now under way on the second smelter furnace in columbus it should be fully operational by the end of 2008 or early in 2009 as noted last quarter we believe this furnace once in operation will increase our processing capacity and provide a strategically critical back up facility during scheduled or unscheduled furnace outages total production from selective mining methods at the stillwater mine was at 86 of the new mill feed while east boulder averaged only 56 at this time we do not expect any significant change in these levels due to the tight labor markets we are currently seeing in the mining industry along with these tight markets for seasoned miners we are renewing our focus on how we can improve and accelerate our existing miner training efforts
3170039 another of stillwaters corporate objectives is to foster new market demand for its primary products
3170040 we also are working toward diversifying the companys asset base
3170041 as i have commented before these investments in generative exploration projects are inherently long term and fairly speculative in nature but are intended to give us access to seasoned exploration teams and build a portfolio of attractive opportunities for the future we also actively track various later stage mineral development projects and operating properties to identify those that might offer good investment value and mesh with stillwaters corporate expertise we are proceeding deliberately in these growth and diversification efforts
3170042 although the 2008 financial results to date are very gratifying we still have a lot on our plate and remain focused on adding value to stillwater over the longer term
3170043 if a child has never touched a fingerprint scanner there is zero probability of being incorrectly investigated for a crime

3170087 any large event in australia is going to absolutely have in amongst the people who come here those who are seeking protection
3170088 its a very clear and known means for people to flee persecution in their country of origin
3170089 if theyre able to get a visa to an event elsewhere and have that as the means by which theyre able to get to a place of safety then thats something thats very much sanctioned under international law
3170090 we were expecting that there would be people coming to us seeking this kind of support
3170091 you can only wear that if you are going to a barn dance
3170092 how much crap from h amp m do you have
3170093 rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem
3170094 growth in health related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing state and local governments as well unsustainable growth in health care spending also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercuts their ability to compete in a global marketplace

3170112 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3170113 russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
3170114 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3170115 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3170116 it had to be the best ever and it was the best ever
3170117 thats the kind of anchor you dream of when you put the world record holder in on the end of a relay and you go into the pool behind him the chance of you beating him is slim and none theres never been a 50 meters like that in my memory not running down somebody that holds a world record and thats on their game that was incredible

3170137 the important point is they havent produced for us that verification regime that we need to go forward on that issue
3170138 what we need from the north koreans is a strong verification regime thats our policy and it still stands
3170139 the process has already been protracted and so it is already clear that this administration is not going to be able to achieve its stated goal

3170142 nbc has a lot at stake both in terms of the event and a promotional platform for a new television season
3170143 i would think if i were nbc right now id be very pleased its still early but judging off these ratings theyre in very good shape
3170144 they have a lot of big commitments to huge advertisers what else were they going to do
3170145 i dont think there is a corporate halo that carries over because i liked the olympics on nbc i will watch nbc programming i dont think it works that way

3170156 we will review the proposals advanced today by the governor and will continue to work with the governor and with our colleagues in the senate

3170165 the plan is to hire a part time code enforcement officer to make sure everyone in potsdam will have adequate housing
3170166 that code enforcement officer will be tasked with more assertively enforcing the new york state property maintenance code
3170167 we asked the housing counsel to put on a home maintenance seminar for us
3170168 if theyre more prepared to meet those challenges then we wont have to apply as regularly for rehabilitation funding
3170169 people will want to move into that neighborhood whereas right now there are streets in potsdam where certain people dont want to live because its considered student housing and its just not a desirable neighborhood
3170170 we did some earth work back there took a bulldozer closed in a gulley and put a new fence up it will be a deterrent theres no doubt it will help but you know a fence is for honest people just like a lock
3170171 we had a lot of complaints so this is a blessing to have something done thats an initial stage to deter some of the bad things so i think its going to pay off immediately
3170172 i can live with anyone elses kids but not my three girls dad loves you all no contact for 365 days family courts harm children

3170480 not on my watch i will no longer be subject to your tyranny
3170481 gos a company known for its debut in the us 199 wal mart gpc and netbooks announced wednesday the details of gos 3 gadgets the newest version of its linux operating system for consumers
3170482 mustard seed has been in california for centuries and so we are just finding a new use for it a new innovative use for the 21st century
3170483 is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention
3170484 to the curious incident of the dog in the night time
3170485 if things go right we can start talking about forever
3170486 i expect that most of the people who participate in this project will continue to stay proprietary free after the week is over because they will discover what we already know linux foss and the freedom to choose in our digital pursuits far outweigh the digital hegemony provided by the digital mandarins in redmond and cupertino
3170487 the lindependence events are a good thing since they help overcome one of microsofts biggest advantages inertia
3170488 if not for the event people would just continue using microsoft products because thats what they have always been using and they would be afraid to try something new on their own
3170489 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
3170490 well work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice by offering this industry leading solution
3170491 great but can i get one without lotus notes too
3170492 to paraphrase yoda notes leads to anger anger leads to notes consultants notes consultants lead to suffering
3170493 2008 will be known as the year of lotus notes on the desktop
3170494 this is a perfect example on why ibm stays ahead they adapt
3170495 they went from proprietary to open from dos to linux from punch cards to computers despite how old ibm seems they always seem to adapt something that some tech companies refuse to do
3170496 one of the weak points of linux desktops over the years has been access to viable let alone powerful productivity applications
3170497 ibms lotus suite has been around for years is used by billions worldwide and is well understood and well established
3170498 for red hat novell and canonical being able to leverage lotus on desktop pcs is a real opportunity
3170499 if a company is thinking of moving to a new platform this mixture of ibm and these partners gives it some options for having a solid business productivity experience with linux that would not necessitate the purchase of either vista or new hardware to support it

3170508 what made you decide to make minix based on a microkernel rather than a monolithic kernel
3170509 good software engineering principles dictate that your programs are modular you dont want a bug in one piece to bring down the whole thing if that can be avoided a microkernel is much better engineered and is more modular and easier to understand monolithic kernels are still too big and unreliable my metric is the tv set the system should run for 10 years with a total of zero failures for 99 9 of the users
3170510 from the very beginning there was a conviction that saddam hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go
3170511 if this is not a proper case of imposition of the death penalty no case ever would be
3170512 if youre not willing to come back with a verdict of death in this case then we should abolish the death penalty in the state of california how many people would you have to kill to get the death penalty
3170513 laura and i are having the time of our lives

3170515 have a light dinner and then head for the ballgame
3170516 no you son of a bitch if i may call you that mr president youre not going to have a perfect day or i should say youre not going to have another perfect day for as long as you live if i have anything to say about it because im going to put a thought in your mind of prosecution that youre going to take with you to your grave its the least i can do for the thousands of young american soldiers that came back from your war in a box or a jar of ashes and for the thousands upon thousands of innocent iraqi men women children and babies who died horrible deaths because of your war thats the least i can do
3170517 reclaiming history for one week was a best seller that was a book that you know weighed seven and a half pounds and cost 57
3170518 oh yeah i know vince weve had him on the show hes a good guest whats the new book
3170519 well let me get back to you on this this may be a little difficult
3170520 mr bugliosi are you sure you want to publish this book
3170521 vince i cant find any audio company in america that will do the audio on the book
3170522 mr bugliosi the reason theyre not having you on television is because of who you are
3170523 if some nut wrote a book with a title like this we would probably have him on because its colorful its entertaining it doesnt mean anything it doesnt go anywhere but youre a very serious person and you write very serious books
3170524 vince come on this is incredible youve been essentially blacked out by the mainstream media and youre still a new york times best seller
3170525 i guess this is just this is what happens during a war
3170526 if you hear about a hundred innocent iraqi civilians in a mosque or a market blown to pieces over there dont you get upset
3170527 holy hell looks sweet i bet the snowbaorders will even have fun in the winter there hella poo
3170528 hey wanna go to the beach for a week naah the mountains maybe later i have an idea lets visit raleigh
3170529 hey raleighs the capital so there must be some cool stuff to do there right
3170530 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3170531 john edwards was interesting because in person when i met him he was very real and authentic from my perception
3170532 his public persona from what i knew of him in 2004 wasnt really that in my opinion
3170533 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species
3170534 going forward there are signs that sales activity might pick up a little as sellers start to re evaluate unrealistic asking prices however the current confused messages from the government regarding stamp duty risks damaging any returning confidence and may discourage mobility
3170535 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3170536 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

3170540 our program is set up to where we offer the associates basically part time hours 20 hours a week but they also get paid full time benefits and full time hours
3170541 i think the biggest thing thats impressed me the most about seeing her here when she is working is that shes just a regular person and shes made it to this great status
3170542 weve been just cheering her all the way you know
3170543 following tdd is more about your mind set and attitude than it is about the process in my opinion
3170544 i feel tdd has the potential to change the way you think about coding
3170545 do you really mean to say that covered code code you dont have to worry about
3170546 taking the initiative to provide infrastructure only you use sounds a lot like wasting time and resources to me
3170547 getting you the things you need is our first priority and quality will be defined in that context
3170548 quality is number one always quality cannot be too high though it could be that you want too much behavior for the situation
3170549 i once felt ashamed about failing to follow best practices for password selection but no more
3170550 that would be the case even if we had done a better job of listening to instructions
3170551 this procedure which now seems perfectly natural because weve been trained to repeat it so much is a bad idea one that no security expert whom i reached would defend
3170552 the solution urged by the experts is to abandon passwords and to move to a fundamentally different model one in which humans play little or no part in logging on
3170553 in short we need a log on system that relies on cryptography not mnemonics
3170554 as users we would replace passwords with so called information cards icons on our screen that we select with a click to log on to a web site
3170555 its clear the momentum is only just starting to pick up
3170556 why not because the companies see the many ways that the password based log on process handled elsewhere could be compromised they do not want to take on the liability for mischief originating at someone elses site
3170557 we wont make much progress on information cards in the near future however because of wasted energy and attention devoted to a large distraction the openid initiative
3170558 frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3170559 t he force of your conviction doesnt ameliorate the burden of making your point clearly and rationally if you want to convince someone else
3170560 for example i hear so many guys using the terms tailor made and custom made interchangeably when theyre totally different
3170561 many guys can tell the difference between designers and wholesale brands or between high and low thread count in fabric but theyre baffled when it comes to the finer distinctions like the difference between custom suits and tailored suits thats where we can help
3170562 it comes down to the fact that if youve got two weeks or more then ordering a tailor made suit online and getting it handmade for your exact measurements by skilled tailors all for under 300 is really hard to beat
3170563 to be honest we dont give a damn what people think about our music
3170564 to be honest we dont give a damn what people think about our music
3170565 we just go into writing or recording sessions and give it 1 000 per cent and play it from the heart and its left in the lap of the gods for people to make of it what they will
3170566 i think if we worried too much about reactions wed be sitting at home twiddling our thumbs were really happy with what we made and thats the main thing for us
3170567 i think all musicians are directed by their own sense of creativity
3170568 if you worried yourself about what people are going to think about what youre doing i think the world would be a very stale place to live in
3170569 to be honest we dont give a damn what people think about our music
3170570 its one of the favorites on the new disc so we cant wait for people to hear it we had a really good time working with brian for the video too and were very happy with his work

3170574 dar ber hinaus hat die sich entwickelnde resistenz gegen zwei bew hrte anti influenza wirkstoffe n mlich oseltamivir tamiflu r und zanamivir relenza r sowie der mangel an geeigneten impfstoffen die notwendigkeit verst rkt neue antivirale wirkstoffe zu entwickeln
3170575 infolgedessen bin ich sehr erfreut an den vorklinischen forschungsarbeiten dieses innovativen antiviralen wirkstoffkandidaten beteiligt zu sein und freue mich auf die fortsetzung der erfolgreichen zusammenarbeit mit canopus biopharma auf diesem gebiet

3170589 part of my problem with tdd has been that it claims to provide complete testing
3170590 part of my problem with tdd has been that it claims to provide complete testing
3170591 asking if i have any experience with tdd implies that without that experience im not competent to evaluate tdd tenets and make reasonable judgments about them
3170592 what that means in practical terms is that we have a tough time separating the value of pout from the value of tdd few people have done both thoroughly enough to judge them based on this relatively singular point of differentiation
3170593 so heres my request for those of you who are using and enjoying tdd who want to invite us all to partake of its superior benefits please couch your arguments in the assumption that i am already pouting that my pouting already delivers substantial benefit and that adopting tdd is a non trivial training and practice burden thank you
3170594 if you are interested try it and see if you like it
3170595 asking if i have any experience with tdd implies that without that experience im not competent to evaluate tdd tenets and make reasonable judgements about them
3170596 what if i told you we are going to start with unit testing
3170597 you should try to create your tests first before the code
3170598 now that youve completely defined the behavior you expect from your conversion functions youre going to do something a little unexpected youre going to write a test suite that puts these functions through their paces and makes sure that they behave the way you want them to you read that right youre going to write code that tests code that you havent written yet
3170599 unit tests are so important that you should write your tests before you write the code
3170600 faced with the substantial alterations in habit and development methodology inherent in tdd many developers and development managers eschew unit testing altogether who wouldnt have had a problem with simpler unit testing methods
3170601 the only relationship that a design has to a methodology is as a limitation design literally cannot be a benefit of a methodology in the absence of the methodology in this case tdd a developer is free to select the very best design
3170602 you know you we really i guess you ought to write the tests first
3170603 ensuring or regularizing unit testing is the primary value proposition of test driven development tdd
3170604 boy jacob i hope you are wearing your asbestos undies
3170605 i dont need tdd to force good design on me
3170606 you are never in an absolute position of sole control
3170607 ask yourself this which unit tests are going to be better the ones created before youve implemented the functionality or those created after or considered another way at which point do you have a better understanding of the problem domain before implementing it or after if youre like me you understand the problem better after implementing it and can thus create more relevant tests after the fact than before i know better where the important edge cases are and how to expose them and that could mean that my tests are more robust
3170608 we also observed that the minimum quality increased linearly with the number of programmer tests independent of the development strategy employed
3170609 testing is optional go ahead do it in the end
3170610 test first programmers did not achieve better quality on average although they achieved more consistent quality results we attribute the latter observation to the influence of skill on quality which test first tended to dampen writing more tests improved the minimum quality achievable and decreased the variation but this effect does not appear to be specific to test first
3170611 at which point do you have a better understanding of the problem domain before implementing it or after
3170612 yeah you tell em i encountered a bunch of tdd zealots and they didnt know squat
3170613 pas menentang umno bukan kerana namanya umno tetapi kerana umno mengekalkan perlembagaan penjajah mengekalkan peraturan kafir dan mengekalkan peraturan jahiliah disebabkan itu perjuangan menentang umno adalah jihad dan jika mereka mati dalam perjuangan itu mati mereka adalah mati syahid

3170615 i drove away elated in disbelief it may have been the most amazing thing ive ever seen
3170616 it was a pretty direct hit i would say to do the damage that it did
3170617 i think about like what could have happened if it just struck like a few inches to another direction it could have hit through out house
3170618 weve been in webster for 18 years or so and weve had summers with bad storms but they roll in and they roll right back out east but this year its been really strange it occurs anytime of day and you dont know when its going to happen
3170619 we should rebuild our military strength not because we want to declare war but because we want to declare peace

3170636 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3170637 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on
3170638 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3170639 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia
3170640 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3170641 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3170642 the situation in georgia is extremely difficult as russia is using all its resources to occupy the country
3170643 todays game was overall not a comfortable game from a personal standpoint
3170644 i knew that barring something like that happening for me i was probably going to go home and have a pretty rough night
3170645 now i can go home and look forward to tomorrow its a nice feeling
3170646 he comes into situations like this and hes just not making pitches
3170647 at first i thought it was going to stay fair for sure then i saw it had kind of had a little lean to it
3170648 i wasnt positive whether it would stay fair im glad it did
3170649 all the time i wait for this kind of moment
3170650 this guy had a no hitter going into the sixth inning without his best stuff
3170651 he ran his pitch count with those five walks but were so happy for this kid weve got a pitcher here hes got four pitches and he can throw them for strikes
3170652 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3170653 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3170654 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3170655 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
3170656 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
3170657 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
3170658 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
3170659 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict in south ossetia attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3170660 evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital
3170661 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3170662 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3170663 its all good and i hope the players know that as nice as everything is thats not going to win us many games
3170664 we have the best facility in football now and i want them to enjoy it its very player friendly but then we cant get too caught up in that we still have a lot of hard work to do
3170665 i had been here with the kingdome and ive been here with the new stadium so to be able to be blessed to see this its great
3170666 we might even get to walk through the whole thing
3170667 a lot of times you talk to a lot of free agents and a lot of them want to see the facilities and what the team has to offer
3170668 the players desks it was the old school desk they would stick to the players as they would walk to their meetings with the desk attached to them and the coaching staff we had our offensive staff and coach bill walsh in one room basically
3170669 its so different but the game has changed the money has changed the stadiums have changed the nfl is a really big business and im very proud of our city everyone that put this whole thing together and allowed us to do this its fabulous
3170670 it was a great way to start especially against them
3170671 theyve got a great defense and theyre strong up front weve had some trouble starting out well on the road in the past but i thought this was a great start and a lot to be happy about
3170672 considering he wasnt a center until three weeks ago id say he did fine
3170673 thats what the preseason is for to work these kinks out
3170674 there are things we need to improve on and this will be a good measuring stick
3170675 our first unit early on we moved the ball pretty well and kind of mistake free there
3170676 thats one of the things you look for in an early preseason game and i like the way we ran the ball
3170677 we feel very comfortable with our running game but we wanted to get our pass game a fresh start
3170678 program information software code or command that would assist another in any material way to circumvent or otherwise attack the security of the fare media system
3170679 the mbta will reserve comment on the substance of the presentation until staff has had a sufficient period of time to thoroughly review the information and meet with the students and their professor
3170680 this is not simply saying we did it arent we inventive its also providing a tool to help accomplish this our understanding is that these would likely be software tools that would make it easier to analyze the cards
3170681 being in a really huge clock shop where its always 12 oclock
3170682 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
3170683 the acquisition of colubris networks will strengthen procurves hardware management platform and services significantly improving the overall performance capabilities of both wired and wireless networks
3170684 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgias georgias capital of tbilisi
3170685 theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3170686 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3170687 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3170688 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3170689 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russians relations russias relations with the united states and europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3170690 in our minicamps he was good and then it was just a matter of him being able to hold up in pass protection
3170691 a lot of people dont think ill be able to do it because of my size but i tell them all the time low pad wins
3170692 theres not too many linebackers in the nfl my size so ive got a little advantage on that point i was prepared in college to block first and run second so thats the kind of mentality i bring
3170693 at first you do kind of question his size but that kid has a big heart and thats all that matters in this league
3170694 its good for him because he was the media darling over there i saw
3170695 i wont be able to coach him now he wont listen to me anymore
3170696 im going to go out there and use my opportunities to my advantage try to seize every moment i can and whatever happens happens i cant worry about the numbers
3170697 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
3170698 we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
3170699 the acquisition of colubris networks will strengthen procurves hardware management platform and services significantly improving the overall performance capabilities of both wired and wireless networks
3170700 the union representative presented a very strong case to me that they believe the nsw fire brigade management is not acting in the communitys best interest by their hard line approach to this matter
3170701 the 2 5 per cent wage offer is totally unacceptable when you consider that inflation is running at four per cent plus at the moment
3170702 i believe the unions submission asking for five per cent in the first year and then four per cent for two succeeding years is a responsible claim and i do not believe that the offsets nsw fire brigades management is asking for are reasonable
3170703 possible reductions in 24 hour fire protection and changes to the training regime are totally unacceptable
3170704 we have to realise that nsw fire brigades are recognised as one of the most efficient effective and well trained emergency fire fighting services in the world and other countries have mirrored their training expertise
3170705 the nsw brigades safety record is second to none and i would oppose any negotiations that would compromise this
3170706 i have spoken to the minister for emergency services nathan rees and relayed to him my concerns about the issues raised by local union representatives
3170707 the minister has assured me that he is listening to the submissions from the unions and is working hard to get a sensible conclusion to these negotiations
3170708 the zig zag tunnels are a challenging location on the main western line about 150 km from central station and we will be examining access and emergency response times
3170709 this exercise will also focus on the evacuation and treatment options for injured rail passengers
3170710 these joint forces exercises enable railcorp and emergency services to work as a team in a fairly inhospitable and remote section of rail corridor so we can all be better prepared if an actual emergency occurs
3170711 its a beautiful site to produce a pyromusical and im very happy with how the show was designed installed and performed
3170712 his unique style and firing techniques really brought the site to life with brilliant rays of pyrotechnic effects that not only illuminated the entire le ronde site but the greater area of montreal with massive 300mm aerial shells that proved to be a real crowd pleaser
3170713 the fire one computer firing system performed beautifully and was the biggest fire one system ever deployed during the competitions 25 year history and we were very very happy
3170714 in fact we used the latest ultra fire software released just the week prior to the show to fire from 172 modules with the greatest precision and we can confirm it works brilliantly
3170715 we had a very successful display and we had a great time working with the entire local la rhonde team who are a great bunch of guys and girls to work with
3170716 the ovation we received after the show and the positive feedback from the la ronde crew and many regular audience members was very satisfying and to win the silver medal is just a brilliant result
3170717 the swedish it sure is a nice web site focusing children but my humble opinion is that it is very web 1 0 and would benefit from a social media fix what do you say all finnish innovators can we hope for a president s blog print post

3170724 it clearly is going to be difficult to get a loan the fed cutting rates doesnt help a lot when you cant get a lender to make a loan

3170743 intel has announced that desktop processors based on the companys upcoming new microarchitecture codenamed nehalem will be formally branded intel core processors
3170744 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward
3170745 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
3170746 and how important it is and how you gotta make the right choices in life and really value it

3170764 as these delegates go about the important business of the convention i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
3170765 russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west and adhering to western political and economic values we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of the world
3170766 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
3170767 say whatever you want about bill clinton but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based
3170768 to undermine barack obama as a quasi american whose lack of american roots are outside the political mainstream according to an inside the bunker article being published in the atlantic on monday
3170769 ridiculed obamas boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii arguing obamas multicultural diversity could be exploited penn in a memo to clinton urged that every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america and include the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today

3170799 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3170800 ive never celebrated that much after a race in my life
3170801 its hard to put that kind of race behind you but it sets me up for something good tomorrow the 200 free final thats my first priority
3170802 i started off with the hardest one im just out there to swim and have fun and thats what im doing
3170803 its a great comeback after the disappointment from this morning
3170804 i showed that im still in form this morning i read the race wrong
3170805 a lot of people are like what in the heck are you doing in that but its really nice to be in an event where theres no pressure on me and no ones expecting anything
3170806 it makes me feel like an age group swimmer because i keep improving
3170807 its hard to put that kind of race behind you
3170808 but it sets me up for something good the 200 free final thats my first priority
3170809 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3170810 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals as long as you have a lane it doesnt matter where you are
3170811 i really thought theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what that is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a supercharge and took it from there
3170812 b team set the previous evening of 3 12 23
3170813 i was watching michael phelps after the anchor leg touched
3170814 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3170815 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3170816 jason is the most phenomenal closer ive ever seen in my life
3170817 hes been able to get his hand on the wall from behind from ahead it doesnt matter
3170818 he was just a part of it and we were a part of it whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3170819 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili said
3170820 the russians are staying near gori they did not enter the city itself
3170821 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people

3170823 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet he said on cnn television adding that georgia must make an accord first with south ossetia and abkhazia
3170824 i got a new album coming out in the later part of the year
3170825 because music is my life so i wasnt going to quit
3170826 we were like a big family and i would say above the mason dixon line motown got it
3170827 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising
3170828 i think a lot of people felt definitely for this particular ad it looked like loreal had pretty much whitewashed beyonce
3170829 a lot of african american celebrities dont want to speak out about this because they dont want to be seen as playing the race card
3170830 if beyonce wants to be silent on her personal life i can understand
3170831 if theres something that has been misconstrued set the record straight so we can learn from it
3170832 just installed a pre commit hook on the kynetx puppet repository to syntax check the puppet files before theyre committed
3170833 does anyone know any of the management team at winder farms http www winderfarms com aboutus executiveteam im looking for an intro
3170834 oh so the chechens won a war against us lets find a pretext to do his all over again and lets win the war even if it means depopulating their capital by 90
3170835 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3170836 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3170837 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3170838 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3170839 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3170840 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3170841 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3170842 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3170843 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3170844 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3170845 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3170846 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3170847 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3170848 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3170849 the ilog acquisition goes a long way in rounding out ibms bpm enabled by soa
3170850 but every choice they made in that movie was wrong

3170858 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3170859 frequent water breaks is what were providing for the kids if at any time theyre feeling dizzy short of breath anything they know they need to see me or the coaches we set them out
3170860 a kid who loses a lot of fluids have more injuries they cant go as hard its not just for injuries we want them to be aware that heat exhaustion and heat stroke can take place
3170861 water is definitely important you dont want to start with sports drink because it will irritate your stomach which will make the situation worse so we start with water and progresses into sports drinks later on because when you sweat you lose electrolytes water is not going to replenish that
3170862 as oil fell to a 14 week low below us114 per barrel
3170863 the market ignored escalating fighting between russia and georgia oil fell on signs of slowing economic growth
3170864 the end result was not as strong as it could have been however as the stock market gave up half its advance in afternoon trade as crude prices recovered some losses and the fed federal reserve said that lending standards have tightened
3170865 the combination of the big drop in crude oil futures prices a huge rally in the dollar and stability in the credit derivatives market provides strong evidence that most of the major problems eroding investor confidence and driving stock prices lower are finally on an upward track
3170866 we expect the markets for worley parsons services will remain strong
3170867 our key markets and sectors continue to experience positive conditions and we are well positioned to respond to these opportunities
3170868 subject to conditions remaining favourable we expect to achieve increased earnings in 2009
3170869 it was a time that shaped what our family was to be from that time on
3170870 i dont know what it was and i think well never know
3170871 they set the course for the rest of their lives
3170872 my mother had a 50 year old view of what institutional care was like she didnt want any part of it for lee
3170873 you hate to criticize your own mother but that was one of her blind spots
3170874 my mother thought with her heart my father thought with his head im more like my dad in that regard
3170875 imagine changing a baby in a body cast burping a baby in a body cast holding a baby in a body cast its going to have an effect on you
3170876 shed gotten used to being confined she was frustrated at times she and i were more like sisters wed call each other and confide to each other but she did what needed to be done
3170877 lee was easily agitated when he got out of his routine
3170878 but i never realized it was supposed to be any other way not until i married and had a family of my own
3170879 its no use to talk to him he wants to attend acu and learn to preach
3170880 my parents did an exceptional job of not focusing their attention all on lee
3170881 i had a separate life my parents always made sure of that
3170882 i thought they spoiled him to tell the truth they wanted to give him everything he wanted
3170883 at the time i thought good grief why didnt he tell me before
3170884 later on i understood that it just wasnt something he thought about he certainly wasnt ashamed of lee it wasnt the center of his world it was the center of mrs moneys world but not his
3170885 it was a sad day when i had to tell my dad it was time to move to a home
3170886 i still remember my mother crying in the kitchen she would open the medicine cabinet and couldnt remember what medicine everyone was taking
3170887 he came down every week to make sure they were ok
3170888 he always saw that they were taken care of he always took them out to eat he made the effort to get lee bud and marian out of the nursing home
3170889 royce told lee he could kiss her and he did then he turned around and left
3170890 you cant know what a royce money would have been without a lee money
3170891 how do you look at someone like royce whos been so successful so sensitive so compassionate and not know that so much of that comes from his brother
3170892 he listens for whats underneath he cares for the heart of a person not just their surroundings
3170893 in my most morbid times i look at lee and think that could have happened to me
3170894 i feel sometimes im living for both of us it could have contributed to my being an overachiever i have felt at times the hope of the family was all on me no one else
3170895 hes got a free trip to heaven hes got an inside track on all of us and thats a great comfort
3170896 my prayer is that in his own good time god will take him peacefully then hell be whole for the first time
3170897 refuses to pay plaintiffs at the correct royalty rate for its digital exploitation of the capricorn masters
3170898 umg incurs practically no expenses or risks in connection with the masters particularly with respect to licensing other companies such as apple to create and distribute digital downloads yet umg reaps millions of dollars every year from such exploitation
3170899 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3170900 texas man who didnt kill may be executed jeff wood didnt kill kris keeran but he is set to be executed for keerans death
3170901 its terribly risky to allow the death penalty to be imposed where the jury has to draw inferences about what was in the defendants mind
3170902 there are serious questions about whether a getaway driver who might have anticipated that a death would take place should be death penalty eligible
3170903 unlike many who have responded to this case i am not an opponent of the death penalty
3170904 the death penalty to me is the easy way out
3170905 if you had to be down there and get up every morning as hot and humid as it is knowing that you are going to spend the rest of your life locked up under those conditions thats punishment thats what i think my son would want for him
3170906 mr wood undeniably shares responsibility for what happened to mr keeran and should be held accountable for his reckless acts but no man ever deserves to die for another mans acts justice was served in this case when the state of texas executed daniel reneau on june 13 2002 the continued imprisonment of mr wood will continue to serve justice

3170946 this advice on demos is almost a verbatim lift from a piece i wrote over 10 years ago
3170947 our original tips were in a slightly different order the first tip was the same we put the taboo about powerpoint in at 2 etc but we covered every one of these points in the written piece which was on the demo web site for three years in our coaching sessions for demo demonstrators and in articles published in a range of magazines of the 2 200 or so words you included in your blog 1 893 were directly lifted from our piece
3170948 her comment here represents her own opinion and claims not that of demo
3170949 the accusations were made in demos name from a former partner of the event at the very least release the document in question
3170950 yes lets see a side by side comparison asap im a life long journalist and everything i write is 100 percent from my brain or attributed this piece i wrote while doing 200 or so interview s for the techcrunch50 event
3170951 when you reach your 50s you finally become comfortable in your own skin it is the decade of your life when you can truly become an individual and do all the things that you have wanted to do
3170952 people in their 50s tend to know their own mind and as a result of their life experience they can enjoy more fun and freedom than people much younger than them

3170957 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3170958 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3170959 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3170960 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3170961 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3170962 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing
3170963 microsoft is making wider adoption of hpc possible by moving
3170964 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
3170965 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
3170966 higher and higher in the tree the valves are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
3170967 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
3170968 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
3170969 and thats what we see at the tops of very tall trees the foliage is struggling to get enough water and seems to be under drought stress its not unusual to see periodic die back at the tops of very tall douglas fir trees that are near their height limits
3170970 its not the broadway show its only an hour and 45 minutes a lot of the score has been cut theyve made it its own thing you have to go in knowing that but what theyve done is great
3170971 they crossed paths of the 2100th block of broadway theres some discrepancy on what happened but there is some evidence that they struck him possibly when he was on the bike
3170972 in this particular this case was a completely random act with no premeditation that were aware of they crossed paths in the middle of the night and unfortunately an altercation happened and as i understand we lost a good man in the community for absolutely no reason whatsoever
3170973 what we have are two individuals that obviously did not value life and an altercation occurred and we have a very negative result and theres consequences to be paid for that theres no correlation between gang activity
3170974 that rumor about the good samaritan i cannot confirm or deny we dont have any evidence except he did encounter these two there appears to be no previous history except this is a senseless act

3171027 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3171028 the georgians were naive to think that the international system could protect them there will be a lot of blame to go around for this we have failed a young democracy
3171029 the georgians made a big mistake now georgia will have to take the toll most probably disproportionately severe
3171030 i believe the georgians were suckered into this and paid a very heavy price if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily
3171031 this makes nato expansion much less likely the last thing the united states needs now is another front thats exactly what russia is taking advantage of

3171231 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
3171232 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
3171233 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
3171234 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
3171235 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
3171236 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
3171237 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
3171238 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
3171239 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
3171240 we are now in a fight against the great russia
3171241 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
3171242 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
3171243 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too

3171270 we think decisions on backup power are best left to the carriers
3171271 it is in our best interest to keep our networks up and running and in the event of an emergency we have resources ready to deploy at a moments notice in addition sprint nextel has a strong track record of getting call traffic moving again and utilizing our resources to serve our customers in emergency situations
3171272 we have extensive backup power capabilities for all of our key network assets and have devoted substantial resources to our best in class disaster recovery capabilities
3171273 we find that the benefits of ensuring sufficient emergency backup power especially in times of crisis involving possible loss of life or injury outweighs the fact that carriers may have to spend resources perhaps even significant resources to comply with the rule
3171274 the need for backup power in the event of emergencies has been made abundantly clear by recent events and the cost of failing to have such power may be measured in lives lost
3171275 we detained nine agents of georgian secret services who were spying on our defense facilities and engineering terrorist acts some of which were to be committed inside russia

3171304 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
3171305 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars

3171309 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
3171310 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
3171311 this translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes perhaps due to stronger than normal connections says saenz who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes
3171312 we might find that motion processing centers of the visual cortex are more interconnected with auditory brain regions than previously thought even in the normal brain
3171313 at this point very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience our senses work together all the time

3171356 people do indulge in acts of asphyxiation either auto or with a partner
3171357 its relatively unusual they do it because it results in heightened sexual pleasure
3171358 theres no way of knowing how common the practice is because you only ever come across it when someone dies from it
3171359 to put it bluntly she was someone who indulged in kinky sex
3171360 her dressing gown showed signs of perhaps quite vigorous sexual activity
3171361 it does not exclude the possibility that the strangulation was either self inflicted or was part of a consensual act with a partner
3171362 pretty horrific to see all that brush in the river
3171363 thats supposed to be a roadway but it looks more like a creek

3171367 theres leeway its just getting everybody together to talk about what everybodys going to do thats the hard part getting everybody to confirm what they want and what we can do
3171368 go for it give it all you got and god bless ya
3171369 hating is like drinking poison and expecting it to kill your enemy
3171370 there is so much difference between how students think and how teachers think
3171371 you think of technology as a tool we think of it as a foundation its at the basis of everything we do
3171372 a lot of teachers make a powerpoint and they think theyre so awesome
3171373 if its the way we want to learn and the way we can learn you should let us do it
3171374 we share with others and get help technology helps it strengthens interactions so we can always stay in touch and play with other people ive never gone a day without talking to my friends online
3171375 kids grew up around computers they love them their computers are their second teachers at home
3171376 if i were using simulation in school that would be the sweetest thing ever
3171377 my teachers bore me so much i dont pay attention
3171378 pointless im engaged in two out of my seven classes
3171379 the disconnect between what students want and what theyre receiving is significant
3171380 it is an always on anywhere anytime anyplace behavior that involves an artificial sense of constant crisis
3171381 we pay continuous partial attention in an effort not to miss anything
3171382 if you made it more interesting we would respond better
3171383 if you give us a goal to get to well get there
3171384 how do you like being able to talk to your teachers and supervisors about your learning
3171385 i like the fact that we become equals students do not get the opportunity that often to share their ideas if students and teachers could collaborate a lot more would get done
3171386 a lot of students care you just dont realize it
3171387 most of the time the teachers are talking and i want to go to sleep but now my brain is exploding
3171388 i think its important that you take time to see what we feel
3171389 now you know what we think and how we feel hopefully that will go to the heart
3171390 i wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen it
3171391 as a general rule you dont hear from kids unless theyve gotten into trouble
3171392 both groups teachers and students can learn from each other
3171393 if you dont talk to us you have no idea what were thinking
3171394 it would be good if teachers have this conversation with us on the first day but often they dont change anything
3171395 i hope this didnt just go in one ear and out the other
3171396 we hope educators take our opinions into account and actually do something

3171414 i begin by declaring to my reader that by everything good or bad that i have done throughout my life i am sure that i have earned merit or incurred guilt and that hence i must consider myself a free agent despite an excellent moral foundation the inevitable fruit of the divine principles which were rooted in my heart i was all my life the victim of my senses i have delighted in going astray and i have constantly lived in error my follies are the follies of youth you will see that i laugh at them and if you are kind you will laugh at them with me you will laugh when you discover that i often had no scruples about deceiving nitwits and scoundrels and fools when i found it necessary

3171431 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3171432 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3171433 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3171434 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3171435 virtually all production has been shut down because of this
3171436 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it
3171437 pre planned cold blooded and pre meditated murder of a small country
3171438 no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3171439 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3171440 all that we have had from the international community is humanitarian aid which is starting to arrive and statements re georgia fighting rages in s ossetia russian tanks head for battle
3171441 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3171442 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3171443 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3171444 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3171445 russian and georgian forces must immediately cease hostilities throughout georgia and return to their august 6 positions
3171446 furthermore in escalating the conflict through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside south ossetia russia has ceased to act as a peacekeeper it is imperative that russia respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
3171447 military force will not resolve this dispute the only viable long term solution is international mediation and peacekeeping
3171448 we understand that we may face a massive money withdrawal so it seems logical to keep the assets in the banks
3171449 but we havent seen any kind of panic so far
3171450 much of the foreign money is invested in the infrastructure road railway and pipeline construction so it will be hard to withdraw
3171451 we try to export our wine and fruit to europe and the united states but they have very high standards so we would prefer russia
3171452 the situation in georgia highlights the greatly increased risks related to energy transits through the country
3171453 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3171454 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3171455 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3171456 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3171457 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3171458 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3171459 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
3171460 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
3171461 the russians have crossed the border and are now in control of zugdidi
3171462 we saw russian military trucks passing by we saw hundreds of soldiers there was a mix of soldiers from the regular army and soldiers that are supposed to be peacekeepers
3171463 is absolutely a war between russia and america the biggest mistake was in underestimating us now youll see what happens
3171464 the whole of south ossetia is in ruins the role of those who came here today is 100 per cent humanitarian they came to rebuild infrastructure
3171465 in the past two days about 2 000 people volunteered these are men with experience of military operations in hot spots
3171466 not one newspaper in the west has written the truth about whats happening here no one has written that the georgians were the ones who started this that they are the ones shooting women and children
3171467 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3171468 but the energy expenditure is too high for us to do anything with so it s purely speculative
3171469 these are places nobodys gone before in essence so this is a first step

3171495 in and of itself the it department is a liability not an asset

3171500 hey thats cool ive probably done something much worse when i first started with computers
3171501 hey thats cool ive probably done something much worse when i first started with computers
3171502 there are three doors pick one then go through now you will be presented with two more doors pick one now flip the coin what are the chances the coin will be heads
3171503 after all all weve actually been told is that there are two dogs distributed as either mm mf or fm but not ff
3171504 two possibilities mm and oneofeach so it is 50 50
3171505 what is the probability that the other one is a male
3171506 what is the probability that both are male given that one is male
3171507 what is the probability that both are male given that one is
3171508 the probability of flipping a coin and getting tails is 50
3171509 i have flipped a coin it came up heads what is the probability that it is tails
3171510 im going to flip two coins i want to know if both are heads both are tails or they are one of each the first is heads given that what is the probability both are heads
3171511 im going to flip two coins what is the probability that one is heads what is the probability the other is heads
3171512 whie its true that you just have mm and mf as possibilities the mf which is equivalent to fm is twice as likely to occur therefore its a 33 chance
3171513 what is the probability that the other one is a male
3171514 given what was just said in the previous 4 sentences
3171515 what is the probability that the other one is a male
3171516 but if he says that the big coin is heads that only leaves two answers small has 1 2 chance of being heads or tails
3171517 to say the odds are 50 50 we would have to know that c was able to answer the question
3171518 what is the probability that the other one is a male
3171519 i take your question to mean what is the probability that both of them are male the answer to that question is 1 3
3171520 your question is meaningless since it relies on an term the other one which cannot be evaluated
3171521 what is the probability that the other one is a male
3171522 what is the probability that the other one is also a male
3171523 you have two dogs i assure you one is male what are the odds that you will correctly guess the gender of both dogs
3171524 goodness i never expected so enthusiastic a reply to this problem ill devote a separate post to trying to sort out some of the issues raised by this problem stay tuned
3171525 choose 2 doors well open both and if the car is behind either one you win
3171526 a shopkeeper says she has two new baby beagles to show you but she doesnt know whether theyre both male both female or one of each
3171527 the first coin is heads what are the chances fo the second being heads
3171528 at least one of the coins is heads what are the chances the other is too
3171529 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3171530 we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
3171531 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction and that this constitutes the very rationale to kill this effort totally we urge you to carefully consider the existing precedent before making your determination
3171532 for consumers the interference will be extensive widespread and unpredictable significantly degrading their service
3171533 in essence theyre gaming the system to make rules so that a new broadband competitor doesnt appear
3171534 any new entrant especially one that appeals to consumers because the price is disruptive is something they want to kill or delay
3171535 to have any relevance they have to stick to this
3171536 we do not believe that there is any well founded evidence in support of large colleges generally
3171537 indeed we are concerned that in some cases mergers may actually be detrimental to the interests of learners employers and communities in terms of reducing choice and potentially undermining local ownership and accountability
3171538 the top performing fe college in the uk after receiving the best results in ofsteds history
3171539 colleges and other providers are autonomous bodies and there is no intention to specify or impose any particular model of organisation
3171540 no evidence of a relationship between college size and success rates
3171541 larger units are more flexible for so many different purposes curriculum timetabling employer support
3171542 larger colleges do not necessarily perform well and colleges of any size can perform well
3171543 half a grade point sounds a small variance but it isnt
3171544 given that no inspection grade can be lower than 1 or higher than 4 the range in play is three points and so half a grade point is a 17 better result
3171545 we will expect to see robust evidence that all other options have been considered proposals will be subject to a high level of scrutiny and challenge
3171546 how will government deal with a small college that loses a couple of contracts in the free market for adult funding
3171547 either that college would have to merge or receive a public subsidy
3171548 before the demise of the carter amp carter group the government could be gung ho and say if colleges cant cope the private sector will
3171549 but now government needs to be more careful it listened to business now it has to listen to colleges
3171550 hes saying that when you get a super college you lose that localness
3171551 i suspect the reason that they are against college mergers is the reason that some colleges are in favour of them
3171552 colleges want to get into a strong position but the department wants a lot of weaker providers fighting like rats in a sack
3171553 no significant change in the ethnic social class or age profile of accepted applicants across the four years 2004 5 2007 8
3171554 its encouraging to see from this report that demand for higher education remains solid despite various changes to the system there continues to be real growth in the number of applications and a pattern of stability in recruitment
3171555 whilst it is encouraging that student numbers have not decreased in our universities it is extremely worrying that there has been no change in the number of students from the very backgrounds the government is spending considerable sums of money on persuading to apply
3171556 with applications to university up significantly and the proportions from lower socio economic groups increasing i am confident the new system is working in major part this is because we have a better fairer and more progressive system of student financial support with no one paying tuition fees before university and because we have brought back and greatly expanded access to non repayable student grants
3171557 he came in one day to give us religious instruction about st joseph the worker but ended up talking about the price of sten guns in the second world war
3171558 there has been a collapse in access to adult education
3171559 it is encouraging to see that the proportion of 17 year olds applying to scottish universities has continued to increase however over the next 20 years the proportion of 17 year olds in scotland is expected to decline significantly if scotland is to achieve sustainable economic growth in the global economy it must have the right people and skills to compete other countries like finland and sweden are achieving higher education participation rates of over 70 per cent all the projections show that growth will occur in occupations that are high in skill and at managerial and professional level it is therefore vital to scotlands future prosperity that we encourage and inspire people to go into university
3171560 it is of concern scotlands demographic problems could also be
3171561 a steady improvement is what we want to see wide variation would be a cause for concern
3171562 most markers are seriously trying to maintain standards but the interpretation of those standards depends on the culture in each subject
3171563 substantial differences in the average grades achieved by the same or comparable candidates
3171564 there has been a much more open debate about it here compared with a lot of countries
3171565 there arent many countries that have an independent body with that role
3171566 we need a better understanding of how the cut off points between exam grades are set the processes in the uk arent as transparent as they could be and they need more focus but that will come out of ofqual
3171567 all i knew about patsy kensits dad was that he was a grass
3171568 i want to get away from the idea that crime is an extraordinary activity
3171569 if you are a victim of crime it is a terrible thing
3171570 but crime can be quite life enhancing for people it gives them a buzz a little bit of the day is theirs if they have a mundane job and have nicked something from work or taken a packet of drugs it gives them the feeling they have some control over their lives they enjoy it otherwise they wouldnt do it
3171571 he was known as a shooter and these werent random acts
3171572 it was someone who would use weapons as part of their job
3171573 anyone can have a whip round take a cheap flight to amsterdam and become an international drugs smuggler hijacking a lorry robbing a bank breaking a safe or whatever is impossible because of the levels of knowledge youd need now its a complete and utter free for all its very democratic
3171574 the idea of coming out having spent 10 to 12 years inside having no car no money family gone back to the bare bones that seemed to worry them far more
3171575 some of it was legal and some wasnt and in the end it didnt matter what was and what wasnt
3171576 trying to break away from all the moral outrage that accompanies so much writing about drugs
3171577 all the civil servants and mps we spoke to agreed with us but they went ahead anyway
3171578 i think its for economic reasons we are so reliant now on pubs and clubs in city centres that if you take that away whats going to be there
3171579 violence was part of our lives and you became quite savvy about dealing with it
3171580 there are certain communities that are undoubtedly racked with fear concerning children killing children
3171581 we need to be very very careful about how we approach it
3171582 a lot of the media approach to both gun and knife crime has been surreptitiously racist
3171583 thats what we need to be careful about because the whole gang thing has been turning it into a racist conversation rather than a conversation about changes in youth and changes in the way youth view the world
3171584 he should not be made a scapegoat over this issue he is by far the best person to lead the qca through this situation
3171585 dont come to our house again because if you do ive got guns
3171586 i have got an air rifle and i have got a pistol and i am going to shoot the fucking vandals who come around here
3171587 go on then shoot me you silly old woman he said he was so near now that i worried he might try to grab the pistol but i knew that if i backed off i would lose face as if to reinforce this he slowly moved his right foot right up against mine toe to toe move your foot i said he didnt i pointed the gun at his foot still he didnt move i obviously wasnt going to shoot him so i moved it to the side of his foot and shot it at the pavement it was as if to say i could have done it but i didnt the gun made a pathetic puff i had his attention now so i fired the gun twice more at the tarmac away from us
3171588 im very sorry for what i did and realise i shouldnt be allowed to do that
3171589 but before i did that my life was totally intolerable because i didnt know what was going to happen next
3171590 im not having anybody bully my kids john said it was like a lioness with her cubs id had enough of them targeting my children
3171591 i dont bear any animosity towards those who targeted the family home now they dont give us grief any more i feel i have had far more damage done to me by the police they could have done something about stopping what was going on they could have helped us more
3171592 i had become ensconced in a world where extreme behaviour was the norm and ceased to be shocked by it
3171593 the pupils were out of control and it felt like a pressure cooker ready to blow
3171594 school was a very stressful place to work and i think i was still grieving for my mum who had recently died but what was driving me to despair was the fear that in some way the attacks on our home were related to my boys and i feared for their safety
3171595 this was the lowest sanction tantamount to a telling off
3171596 i was really pleased i didnt feel vindicated but i did feel i now had some credibility again the panel had risked public criticism to impose the lowest sanction against me and i was grateful
3171597 the utter futile frustration of being incarcerated isolated removed from my life the agony of separation from those i love and the pain of those who love me the boredom the waste of precious time the removal of free will
3171598 numbers racket why the economy is worse than we know
3171599 wall street after two terms of a business friendly republican president self immolated on a pyre of greed incompetence and excessive optimism
3171600 life is a series of problems do we want to moan about them or solve them
3171601 bubbles are primarily social phenomena until we understand and address the psychology that fuels them theyre going to keep forming
3171602 few people seem immune to boom thinking the recent bubble grew so large partly because the very people responsible for the financial systems oversight came to share the general publics rosy expectations
3171603 no one wants to cut their dividend because it is an open advertisement that you are having a cash flow problem
3171604 many companies are extremely proud of their dividend record they do no want to destroy their shareholders good will the stockholders that hold for the dividend are exactly the kind of shareholders you want
3171605 while financials traditionally pay out the most in dividends there are many other niches of this market where attractive yields can be found
3171606 investors are going to look back at some of these companies with high yields and think they should have scooped them up while they had the chance
3171607 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
3171608 they told us to come out i dont know why but some of our guys are still out there in the fields
3171609 i want to go back if we lose south ossetia now it wont be for ever because we will never surrender our land
3171610 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
3171611 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more
3171612 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
3171613 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now
3171614 we are operating normally nobody has disturbed us at all
3171615 i know that lots of my neighbours are dead i have no idea who is left
3171616 migron will not be evacuated by august despite the states promise to the supreme court
3171617 we are the testing ground for all the residents of judea and samaria vis a vis the governments weakness we are the first stone in the dam but it is within our power to prevent the fall of the entire dam
3171618 i would definitely be concerned as a passenger i would definitely be concerned were talking flight safety here and its almost a cavalier attitude that theyve taken toward flight safety
3171619 the faa is investigating why our backup circuits did not kick in as they should have within five seconds
3171620 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3171621 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3171622 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3171623 applause exploded in the stadium at the rising sun flag though it reminded the koreans of their unfortunate past the japanese contingent responded by waving pink roses of sharon
3171624 tears burst forth one lap was not enough i wanted to spend more time walking in the stadium
3171625 the success of the seoul olympics is the common aspiration of mankind for world peace and prosperity
3171626 until i was assigned to seoul i like my colleagues hated korea
3171627 the sky was so blue and the people were so bright i was astounded
3171628 we cannot run society for the privileged and allow a significant proportion of the population to be marginalized it impacts the quality of life for all of us if we have throwaway people a justice system which tolerates injustice is doomed to collapse i am truly ready for action
3171629 du er historiel s og p b rtur herr minister
3171630 i sat with my daughter in my arms in our tent so they could not burn our things they used obscene words and said they did not want people like us here and they would kill us and burn everything if we did not get off the lands
3171631 we want to see a sign that here government exists that there is organization here that a state of law exists in this country
3171632 in el vallecito there are rich property owners from portugal france and the united states but when venezuelan creoles who are not from their family or class wish to cultivate the valley those fascists reject us
3171633 we are not fighting for land but for the water of m rida
3171634 it is not that we are against endogenous development but it should grow from the community and not from outside
3171635 if you wish to cancel our project because you have proof of substantial environmental dangers ok we can understand that
3171636 but we have made clear that we do not believe in agro chemicals and several of us including myself were trained in ecological farming in cuba
3171637 within the ministry there is resistance to really participate with communities
3171638 has proven social political and community work has obtained legal title to the aforementioned lands and its productive projects have an agro ecological focus and comply with the regulations of use of the mucuj n river bank
3171639 les maisons sont comme les gens elles ont leurs ges leurs fatigues leur folies ou plut t non ce sont les gens qui sont comme des maisons avec leur cave leur grenier leurs murs et parfois de si claires fen tres donnant sur de si beaux jardins
3171640 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3171641 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3171642 el momento para mirar ser durante las horas de oscuridad antes del amanecer del martes 12 de agosto deber a haber bastantes meteoros tal vez uno o dos por minuto
3171643 las estelas de los meteoros que rozan la tierra son largas lentas y coloridas y constituyen una de las clases de meteoros m s bellos
3171644 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3171645 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3171646 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3171648 o jogo contra o corinthians vale tr s pontos como qualquer outro claro que tem uma import ncia maior mas nossa preocupa o nos distanciarmos do quinto lugar

3171652 there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man it is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity it is the middle ground between light and shadow between science and superstition and it lies between the pit of mans fears and the summit of his knowledge this is the dimension of imagination it is an area which we call the twilight zone
3171653 vamos ter uma semana para trabalhar quero uma boa arrancada no segundo turno porque a nossa meta uma campanha diferente
3171654 conseguimos a vit ria pois jogamos em conjunto quando a bola foi nossa tivemos qualidade para atacar sem ela um ajudou o outro na marca o

3171659 any trader or investor who ignores the power of macroeconomics over the worlds financial markets will sooner or later lose more than they should and if they are trading on margin perhaps more than they have
3171660 if you remove the problem child the financials s amp p earnings have increased by 10
3171661 regardless of the estimates or hype a double digit gain from non financials is impressive in any economy
3171662 if we cant drill our way out of oil shortages
3171663 as peaking is approached liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically and without timely mitigation the economic social and political costs will be unprecedented viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides but to have substantial impact they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking
3171664 acho que a prioridade sim a sul americana um t tulo que nenhum brasileiro tem um campeonato curto de poucos jogos temos condi es de passar pelo botafogo e seguir em frente

3171666 well of course in this new free country i have just created the government gets a piece of everybodys action every kind of action and thatll work indefinitely
3171667 the income tax is what it is we just have to deal with it
3171668 the moment the idea is admitted into society that property is not as sacred as the laws of god and that there is not a force of law and public justice to protect it anarchy and tyranny commence
3171669 he rightly says that things economic are about to get ugly and when they do there ought to be as many people as possible that understand what has happened and why
3171670 the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the several states and without regard to any census or enumeration
3171671 provides for a hitherto unknown power of taxation that is a power to levy an income tax which although direct should not be subject to the regulation of apportionment applicable to all other direct taxes
3171672 one provision of the constitution to destroy another that is they would result in bringing the provisions of the amendment exempting a direct tax from apportionment in to irreconcilable conflict with the general requirement that all direct taxes be apportioned
3171673 no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken
3171674 taxation on income was in its nature an excise entitled to be enforced as such unless and until it was concluded that to enforce it would amount to accomplishing the result which the requirement as to apportionment of direct taxation was adopted to prevent in which case the duty would arise to disregard form and consider substance alone and hence subject the tax to the regulation as to apportionment which otherwise as an excise would not apply to it
3171675 go ahead congress but watch yourselves because if you ever step over this line this excise tax will no longer be constitutional as such and will need to be apportioned
3171676 all proceeds to any person from any activity at all are income minus these exempted amounts
3171677 all remuneration other than fees paid to a public official for services performed by an employee for his employer
3171678 an officer employee or elected official of the united states a state or any political subdivision thereof or the district of columbia or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing the term employee also includes an officer of a corporation
3171679 protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they may be
3171680 commissioned from private israeli security firms several hundred military advisers estimated at up to 1 000 to train the georgian armed forces in commando air sea armored and artillery combat tactics they also have been giving instruction on military intelligence and security for the central regime tbilisi also purchased weapons intelligence and electronic warfare systems from israel these advisers were undoubtedly deeply involved in the georgian armys preparations to conquer the south ossetian capital friday
3171681 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations
3171682 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
3171683 therefore the world economy is going to start growing exponentially because as yet only a small proportion of these populations are better off
3171684 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive
3171685 we will not lie cheat or steal or tolerate among us those who do
3171686 with gas prices and the economy lots of companies are changing the way they do business
3171687 its hard for people in rural areas to change their routine they depend on getting in an older vehicle thats less fuel efficient
3171688 i would say the brand to this day is very important but we saw a decline in sales last year so there has been the concern that there are cracks in the foundation for ea sports
3171689 there is a violence in not being able to live your life and whether you are ever actually struck by someone is not the only issue anything that pushed you toward being less than human anything that tells you you are not a part of the human family is a violent act
3171690 no you dont youre an animal what makes you human what says that those people arent right that youre not sinning that you arent less than they are
3171691 we are so proud of terry and are going to miss him terribly he was true to his art and respected by all the industry
3171692 he was a very powerful character actor able to play villains and nice roles with ease he was particularly good at playing pinter roles which were very difficult
3171693 he had weight on stage this strong dominating physical presence when he came on there was a sense of something dangerous
3171694 no significant change in the ethnic social class or age profile of accepted applicants across the four years 2004 5 2007 8
3171695 its encouraging to see from this report that demand for higher education remains solid despite various changes to the system there continues to be real growth in the number of applications and a pattern of stability in recruitment
3171696 whilst it is encouraging that student numbers have not decreased in our universities it is extremely worrying that there has been no change in the number of students from the very backgrounds the government is spending considerable sums of money on persuading to apply
3171697 with applications to university up significantly and the proportions from lower socio economic groups increasing i am confident the new system is working in major part this is because we have a better fairer and more progressive system of student financial support with no one paying tuition fees before university and because we have brought back and greatly expanded access to non repayable student grants
3171698 i doubt there will be many to whom we say up with this we cannot put we will not register you
3171699 that is not a massive proportion and they know what they need to do
3171700 we want to talk softly and carry a big stick we are the care quality commission not the care failure commission
3171701 disclosed to the sfo evidence that had come to light suggesting that in 2002 the company may have indirectly made two payments to the iraqi regime in breach of un sanctions
3171702 has recently been notified of allegations that certain historical contracts may have been procured through corrupt acts
3171703 the company will continue to cooperate voluntarily and fully as appropriate with the sfo
3171704 the board of the company is committed to the current in depth review of policies and procedures and the subsequent training to ensure that all employees and international representatives comply fully with the mabey group code of ethics
3171705 he should not be made a scapegoat over this issue he is by far the best person to lead the qca through this situation
3171706 im gonna jack me a car drive us west to california
3171707 give him the money im heartbroken and sign me up for another 100m movie
3171708 it was music especially my passion for the violin that drew me to the issues surrounding the roma my trips to hungary and now the recent events in italy have left me profoundly perturbed by public attitudes to this community its fascinating that century after century gypsies are both the most romanticised people on earth and the most vilified this is almost as much the case now as it was two centuries ago writers of course have been milking the situation for donkeys years my second novel hungarian dances tells the story of a british born violinist karina whose discovery of hidden truths about her hungarian family history and her formidable grandmother mimis roma background challenges her own sense of identity
3171709 almost two thirds of the wage gap is because of reasons unexplained and one third is for reasons explained
3171710 this could be a result of women working in less skilled manufacturing positions or could be evidence of discrimination in that sector
3171711 anyone can see this is not the case of the century the fact is that britney is being treated differently
3171712 this should be just treated as a fix it ticket or an infraction
3171713 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
3171714 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently
3171715 weve been challenged at the newsstand recently which is an industry wide trend and the decline pretty much mirrors where we are vis a vis our competitors
3171716 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
3171717 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently
3171718 weve been challenged at the newsstand recently which is an industry wide trend and the decline pretty much mirrors where we are vis a vis our competitors
3171719 you get a good grade and get eliminated that just isnt fair
3171720 i am extremely disappointed in homeland security and very upset that homeland security issues would be subject to political pressure
3171721 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
3171722 as we have from the beginning we are encouraging the department of homeland security to keep the selection process focused on the merits
3171723 kansans should be able to trust that moving forward the selection process will be fully transparent and accountable
3171724 there were fires and riots and serial killers it was great
3171725 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
3171726 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3171727 there was heart disease and diabetes in my family tree and i made a conscious effort throughout my running career to break that cycle within our family tree
3171728 of the active lifestyle that baby boomers are engaged in nowadays running seems to be the least expensive the most enjoyable
3171729 the key is to learn how to run ive only had one injury that kept me off of running for not more than three days no back problems no knee problems in 47 years as in relation to running and there were some weeks when i was putting in 125 miles a week
3171730 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3171731 i think people assume im a democrat but im registered independent and im still undecided so im looking at 0 opinions for

3171733 in the past 10 years we have created more dishes than world cuisine in the past century the dialogue between science and cuisine opens new doors
3171734 the success of the model lies in being able to adapt what youre offering in the shortest time possible to what clients want
3171735 for inditex time is the principal factor to take into account more so than the costs of production
3171736 she just completed a 78 5 mile road race i dont think
3171737 just 2 of articles and 1 of images in the sports pages of national newspapers are devoted to female athletes and womens sports just 1 4 of sports photography featured women and despite the fact our research only looked at the sports pages there were more images of models footballers girlfriends the french presidents wife and a nun than of sportswomen
3171738 there were 367 links from the front page to articles but just five links went to female sports 1 there was not one image of a female athlete on the front page of the top 10 websites out of 129 images both photos and film there were four images of women 3 sky sports did have a film of two female sports presenters a third image was of former big brother contestant kate lawler in her underwear in a marathon photograph shot and a fourth image was of an advert for womens health
3171739 team ethos an interest in what the british team is doing as a whole there isnt a separation between male and female events
3171740 when you see the camera shots that are taken when the female players are on court and you compare that with the camera shots when the male players are on court theres definitely an attitude that theyre looking for the feminine shot those moments when they can zoom in on a womans legs for example and then in all the tennis coverage theres the massive interest in fashion even the people who are interviewing the women post match will say how are you going to dress for tonights event which is a long way off the point
3171741 whats great with the olympics is the immediacy of it all you see the women competing and then theyre on the rostrum straight away looking incredibly natural and thats so great to see when it comes to tennis coverage there are so many links between the sports and the fashion worlds now a lot of the promotion around wimbledon this year concerned parties for instance rather than just that specific focus on the sports field
3171742 my coach rang to say bmx had been introduced to the olympics that was it id wanted to be an english teacher but you can go back to college you cant go back to being an olympic gold medallist
3171743 one of the things the industry has long called for is to move on from a one size fits all mentality to one that reflects regional need customers will be hoping the regulator will reflect this regional diversity in the final determinations in 2009
3171744 our view is that realistic investment in renewing assets cant be put off indefinitely at least it cant without risking a fall off in service that customers would hate and could seriously damage the economy and the environment
3171745 some of this increase is also aimed for the first time at dealing with climate change related issues from improving the flood resilience of critical infrastructure to widespread plans to increase household metering
3171746 ofwat have a very difficult task in balancing the requirement for significant investment with customers priorities not to see bills increase more than is necessary
3171747 water and sewerage prices between 2010 and 2015 need to be set in line with what customers are willing and able to pay and companies should deliver a package of benefits in line with what consumers see as a priority
3171748 the consumer council for water has encouraged water companies to give extra back to consumers and this has resulted in 130m of benefits in two years we will take the same approach in pressing ofwat and the companies to be guided by the needs of consumers up to 2015
3171749 we can provide all the electricity oil gas and petrochemicals that people need without causing harm to the environment

3171754 put together a new application to herefordshire for four turbines
3171755 the ardrossan wind farm has been overwhelmingly accepted by local people instead of spoiling the landscape we believe it has been enhanced the turbines are impressive looking bring a calming effect to the town and contrary to the belief that they would be noisy we have found them to be silent workhorses
3171756 it is not the slightest bit involving and is sadly lacking not only in substance but also in basic narrative structure it is hard to make poetry out of confusion
3171757 but he will undoubtedly be massacred by the film critics
3171758 it seemed he got lost in his car somewhere in the centovalli region
3171759 its problems of rhythm and the total absurdity of certain scenes are topped off by the platitude of the infrequent dialogue which ends up making everything insipid
3171760 those for whom his books are all about the sex scenes also risk disappointment the film has only got one the pen suits him much better than the camera
3171761 houellebecq hasnt managed to make a film with the same impact as his writing it is the usual modernist fare
3171762 we are meeting with regulators today in jefferson city mo and look forward to the discussions
3171763 i just dont understand why people keep breeding and buying these dogs unless they just like to give me money

3171778 additionally consumer reports estimates that american consumers have replaced about 2
3171779 went to town with it for the longest time couple years actually
3171780 that is like killing the patient to cure the disease
3171781 rygelskis initial response was no and his final response was no but in between was an hour and a half of discussion on the beliefs practices polity and history of the catholic church
3171782 after saying his final answer was no rygelski said he would discuss it with bishop hermann
3171783 i am increasingly impressed with the roman hierarchs mind reading abilities bishop hermann like his predecessor archbishop burke seems unfortunately comfortable ascribing motives and ideas to people with whom he refuses to meet
3171784 a growing number of catholics in st louis and across the globe are questioning the methods of the bishops we wonder if they dont exhibit a fundamental detachment from the realities of the lives of catholic christians
3171785 when bishop hermann writes everything that my superiors asked me to do has brought me incredible satisfaction peace joy and fulfillment
3171786 there are serious issues facing the church globally and locally its time the bishops took seriously their responsibility to be ministers of unity
3171787 its not enough for them to lay down the law and expect well educated well meaning well equipped members of the church to toe the line lay women and men are integral members of this church though they are effectively ignored in decision making
3171788 well educated well meaning well equipped members of the church
3171789 as editor of the review ive always striven to make it a real newspaper but a newspaper thats always faithful to the teachings of the church and does all it can to explain those beliefs to its readers

3171800 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3171801 we took into account 30 different variables including age weight diabetes cholesterol high blood pressure whether they exercise smoking and we found that low vitamin d levels independent of all these other risk factors for heart disease predicted an increased risk of dying from any other cause so we found a new risk factor for death
3171802 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3171803 such tragedies are becoming all too common and many of these deadly accidents are preventable
3171804 it certainly would appear to me theres reason to believe that seatbelts wouldve saved lives in this particular tragedy
3171805 in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
3171806 now the whole world knows so i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
3171807 i know there was concern that the process was taking quite a bit of time perhaps too long
3171808 i too shared in these concerns and expressed them to those directly involved

3171844 in less than a decade cellphones once the preserve of the very rich are now ubiquitous in africa and parts of asia a device thats sometimes used as a fashion accessory in the west has become a lifeline for millions of people in the developing world
3171845 in the democratic republic of congo with a population of 60 million there are just 10 000 fixed telephones but more than a million cellphone subscribers while in chad the fifth least developed country in africa cellphone usage jumped from 10 000 to 200 000 in three years

3171877 we knew there was going to be strong interest in the film based on the great cast we had that was willing to really work the movie and do all the publicity
3171878 the exit polls were very strong and its striking a core with women and an older audience
3171879 it was very very strong in a marketplace where the viewer has a lot to draw their attention to including the olympics the market is getting a lot more crowded these days in new york the sunday numbers were virtually the same as saturday only a couple hundred dollars less
3171880 in los angeles our highest gross of the weekend was on sunday at the arclight so it was really gratifying to see that for a lot of people elegy was their number one choice
3171881 we have a fairly aggressive release plan and were happy to see at this stage we can continue to execute it
3171882 i think everyone that is going to write about vicky cristina barcelona and mention penelope cruz is also going to mention her performance in elegy
3171883 i think it could help initially when we set our release date vicky was scheduled for an august 29th release date the move of that release to us condensed the two films in the minds of press
3171884 i dont think ive ever worked on a film that went up that much from friday to saturday
3171885 and i didnt see any other films with that increase so it wasnt like it was an artificial success due to the olympics or anything
3171886 randall miller has been involved in every step of the release

3171919 we have over 70 varieties of fruiting species that include numerous sub tropical varieties that many people in the bega valley could be growing

3171929 with the price of jet fuel reaching an unprecedented high level the jal group has decided to carry out a bold review of the original fy2008 plan further concentrating its resources on improving profitability and increasing competitiveness
3171930 in japan jal will conduct the biggest review of its domestic passenger operations since 2002 by cutting unprofitable routes adjusting supply to demand through flight frequency reductions on other routes and by adding more flights on popular routes
3171931 despite good fundamentals we have been unable to insulate ourselves from sector developments indeed the second quarter was clearly weaker than the previous year the latter part of the year also seems difficult and the operational result for the second half of the year might dip into the red
3171932 high fuel prices and a trend towards lower ticket prices have been unsettling developments for airlines the overcapacity in the market has not allowed ticket prices to rise in parallel with costs the coming cost cutting programmes in the sector will be so severe that in countries where airlines collapse there may be demands for flight connections to be maintained for business needs using state funds
3171933 the situation in the sector may remain extremely difficult due to expensive fuel and uncertain development of demand in the second half of the year fuel costs are expected to account for around 28 per cent of finnairs turnover whereas last year the jet fuel bill accounted for a fifth of turnover
3171934 one of the critical factors of maintenance being performed is the number of licensed engineers and in australia that ratio is approximately one to one or two to one
3171935 we find that the overseas facilities that ration could be as large as one licensed engineer to 10 unlicensed engineers
3171936 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
3171937 with regards to the string of faults that were reported in the media malaysia airlines investigated and established that these were unsubstantiated
3171938 this is based on the fact that all these aspects were originally checked and found to be free from defect during the maintenance check and test flight with the concurrence from the qantas team
3171939 we are fully committed to executing all aspects of aircraft engineering maintenance with no compromise to safety and security as well as meeting the expectations of both our customers and the global regulatory authorities that have recognised our competencies
3171940 you would expect that in a modern organised society infections should be declining particularly these ones that are transmitted from person to person
3171941 the hypothesis is that weve had an increase in household crowding and increasing socio economic inequality with some populations particularly in the 1990s
3171942 although there was a large increase in hospitalisations in the 1990s it was pretty much driven by the increase in close contact infectious diseases it represents a tidal change in the infectious disease burden in new zealand
3171943 its one of the theories put forward to explain this trend in the emergence of the meningococcal epidemic that research hasnt been done yet to see if these events did coincide more precisely
3171944 his cullens eyebrows were raised by the fact the council could tap into 17m for a property developer but could not see clear to find money for housing tenants
3171945 he asked how could they find that money when they could not find money for housing it was a very good question that i knew he would ask
3171946 i am hoping cullen will listen and understand our position from the point of view of the residents rather than the council if i was asking for money for the council i know what the answer would be
3171947 i have never known a time when there has been less communication from council than there is now it is amazing we might be able to help if someone told us what is going on
3171948 i think it was pretty stunning they could find that amount of money with what seemed like urgency for a deal that gives dave henderson first refusal for buy back
3171949 it feels like a bailout for henderson rather than a way of protecting the development vision of the council
3171950 i would have thought there were better ways like city plans and bylaws to control development
3171951 there is an enormous question mark over the validity of the council entering into an agreement like this

3171975 will largely depend on the performance in the final quarter where 33 per cent of earnings before interest and tax traditionally occurs and there being no further deterioration in the new zealand trading environment
3171976 continued solid performances from our australian and asian businesses give the board confidence that apn is well placed to take advantage of improvements in underlying trading conditions in each of our major markets
3171977 these are a good set of results against the background of the global credit crisis
3171978 our australian and asian businesses have performed well during the period with in particular our outdoor business being the standout performer
3171979 our new zealand businesses have been affected throughout the period by the economic slowdown with a number of our major advertisers cutting back advertising plans
3171980 we are also announcing today the acquisition of media1 new zealands third largest outdoor advertising business cementing our position as the largest outdoor operator in that market
3171981 whilst we have undoubtedly seen some project creep during the half particularly in relation to our australian publishing business all projects are now fully operational

3171994 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3171995 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3171996 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3171997 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3171998 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3171999 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3172000 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3172055 the terrain and the time fire started and once we get an hour into darkness air resources arent able to assist

3172123 afortunadamente para el pa s no ha ocurrido ayer lo que m s se tem a que se diera una victoria abrumadora de unos sobre otros lo cual hubiera terminado seguramente por hacer crecer los mpetus del gran vencedor para asumir posiciones m s radicalizadas a manera de exhibici n de fuerza y de lucir el trofeo ganado
3172124 los resultados del refer ndum revocatorio de ayer no han sorprendido a nadie ha sido ratificado el presidente de la rep blica evo morales con un porcentaje alto de 63 por ciento seg n el conteo r pido de votos de la empresa ipsos apoyo pero tambi n han sido ratificados los prefectos de la denominada media luna con porcentajes igualmente altos superiores a los que obtuvieron en las elecciones del 2005 en los discursos de los ganadores de ayer con excepci n del prefecto rub n costas se advirti un tono moderado conciliador que parecen augurar un mejor entendimiento entre el gobierno y las prefecturas opositoras llam particularmente la atenci n el cuidadoso y cauto discurso del presidente evo morales que lejos del usual estilo amenazador y confrontador de sus intervenciones anoche se mostr respetuoso de los prefectos ratificados y anunci que el voto ciudadano debe ser entendido como un mandato para compatibilizar la constituci n masista y los estatutos auton micos morales manej sin soberbia su contundente victoria ratificatoria y eso habla muy bien de l por lo menos en este caso y aunque tambi n es muy posible que las buenas se ales que anoche dieron los l deres vencedores se desvanezcan muy pronto lo deseable es que de una vez por todas entiendan que en las urnas o lejos de ellas la voluntad de la sociedad boliviana desde la diversidad que la identifica contin a demandando de ellos lo mismo que desde hace varios meses di logo aut ntico para promover el entendimiento de los bolivianos y no el sometimiento de unos contra otros habr n comprendido eso el presidente y los prefectos
3172125 hace pocos minutos se acaba de materializar lo que la semana pasada se fue construyendo como una conjura como un saboteo por parte del estado y su conjunto en contra del pueblo quiero recordar que lo acaba de ocurrir es un atentado al pueblo de venezuela a los venezolanos y a su derecho de elegir esto es una violaci n a los derechos humanos del pueblo
3172126 hoy nosotros fuimos excluidos de nuestro derecho fuimos extra dos del derecho que tenemos de participar en un proceso electoral y que el pueblo elija quienes son autoridades pero seguimos adelante
3172127 urgimos a todas las partes a que aprovechen esta oportunidad para comenzar un di logo franco para resolver temas pendientes y definir un camino hacia adelante que una a todos los bolivianos
3172128 en su viaje hacia un futuro m s democr tico y pr spero
3172129 ratific a un presidente y un proceso cultural una revoluci n que reafirma los valores propios del pueblo boliviano de seguir protagonizando ese proceso revolucionario
3172130 la derecha medi tica impuls toda la negatividad la destructividad y la sa a adem s racista contra el compa ero evo morales y su gobierno y contra el pueblo boliviano que est conformado en su mayor a por pueblos ind genas
3172131 el proceso se efectu muy pac ficamente y con pleno respeto de parte de los bolivianos
3172132 en un clima de tranquilidad en el que los ciudadanos bolivianos pudieron expresar libremente sus preferencias pol ticas
3172133 la madurez democr tica de la sociedad boliviana y desea que esta consulta popular favorezca el necesario di logo entre el gobierno y las distintas fuerzas pol ticas del pa s

3172135 y con el pa s viviendo bajo un clima de tensi n por una casi generalizada conflictividad y con el olor a sangre todav a flotando en el ambiente tras las violentas escaramuzas registradas en caihuasi oruro y que empa aron el aniversario patrio qued configurado el mbito menos propicio para el cuestionado plebiscito pero as y todo la gente fue a votar
3172136 un derrotero que no han podido se alarle con claridad y precisi n unos conductores dominados por un soberbio empecinamiento unos conductores obcecados que junto a la racionalidad tambi n parecen haber extraviado el norte y que ciegos y sordos no han sido capaces de hacer un alto en su acelerado tr nsito para intentar al menos rectificar el rumbo antes de terminar desvencijando completamente la nave del estado a punta de barquinazos y salidas de ruta entonces planteadas as las cosas nos ratificamos plenamente en el convencimiento de que el refer ndum revocatorio que ya es parte gris de nuestra desventurada historia republicana no contribuir en absoluto a la resoluci n de los graves problemas que afectan a bolivia por tanto no nos desvelan las interpretaciones del veredicto popular en boca de urna ni los resultados oficiales de la consulta que vendr n m s adelante esto si es que se logra desenmara ar de alg n modo la forma de su lectura para establecer en definitiva qui n se va o qui n se queda en el palacio quemado o en las prefecturas y es que con toda la parafernalia del revocatorio al margen nuestra preocupaci n mayor se centra en lo que podr ganar o perder el pa s llegado como hoy en medio de unos agoreros pron sticos que ojal no pasen de eso el d a despu s si para bien cambiar la suerte de la rep blica o se prolongar indefinidamente la cerraz n de sus horizontes dios quiera que no
3172137 we have asked the government to give us legal empowerment so that commodity brokers also can be included as an entity in pml act

3172139 i had no expectations because it was my first olympics i just wanted to give it my best i never thought i have to win and wanted to give my 100 per cent
3172140 getting into the quarter finals is something i never thought of
3172141 it can be quite lonely i cant wait for the school term to end
3172142 my father wants me to learn mandarin so that it will be easy for me to get a job in the future
3172143 i was posted here two and a half years ago it is difficult to describe how i felt when i first reported for duty
3172144 it can be boring at times i keep myself busy by doing office work as we do not have a clerk here
3172145 the residents here have applied to the authorities to turn the two wooden blocks into a community hall
3172146 it was a bit of a culture shock when i first came here in 2006 but i have since adapted to the situation
3172147 let us take that extra mile let us reach out and feel what they feel
3172148 the wives of bns peoples representatives are also the catalysts in inculcating and motivating the spirit of volunteerism in society
3172149 consider yourself as playing a complementary role to your husband in fulfilling his responsibilities as a wakil rakyat
3172150 we need to pay attention to the problems of the people in our midst
3172151 master cpl doyle was killed while he was protecting his position and his fellow soldiers
3172152 erin was a big tough mountain of a man who enjoyed the outdoors
3172153 he was a true warrior and just the person you would want beside you in a firefight
3172154 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviours from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity
3172155 anecdotal evidence mentioned in the paper suggests that yes the human pride and shame displays are very similar to non human displays of dominance and submission seen in a wide range of animals
3172156 pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status
3172157 i never thought the law would be applied like that
3172158 i thought it would apply to other people but not to me
3172159 theres got to be a certain amount of common sense applied here
3172160 efficient use of waqaf will help reduce the gap between rich and poor communities as well as ensure a fairer distribution of wealth
3172161 to ensure that all government projects would proceed as planned the government has also agreed to provide incentives relating to variations in the value of contracts following higher prices of building materials
3172162 it is important for all of us to take this advice seriously
3172163 i hope that such a thing will not happen again
3172164 what happened on that day proves that racial and religious issues are sensitive such matters are not meant for discussion it is important we restrain or control ourselves from discussing them
3172165 they have the information and can take action if the proof is insufficient action cannot be taken but if there is they can decide on action to be taken
3172166 consultation is being held between the government and certain quarters
3172167 what political uncertainty are you talking about what has the permatang pauh by election got to do with political uncertainty
3172168 we have had many by elections in the past and there is no such thing as political uncertainty one by election cannot make any difference to the present situation
3172169 he has been talking about all sorts of things he has been saying there will be a no confidence vote in parliament
3172170 but nothing happened he keeps on saying all these things to let the people know that he is the person waiting to be the prime minister
3172171 he is making speculations to make himself sell that is all
3172172 connections between art forms which might seem at first to have nothing in common
3172173 rusia ha invadido a un estado soberano vecino y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico elegido por su pueblo una acci n como esa es inaceptable en este siglo xxi
3172174 hay evidencia de que fuerzas rusas pueden comenzar pronto a bombardear el aeropuerto civil en la capital si esos reportes son ciertos esas acciones rusas representar n un escalada dram tica y brutal del conflicto en georgia
3172175 we will get to look at the petition signatures that they counted invalid and we will get to build a case on why some or all of those signatures should be considered valid
3172176 thousands of arizonans said they want this on the ballot and we believe it should be on the ballot
3172177 yo no era senador y mi esposa nelly melo se estaba juramentando como gobernadora y yo simplemente era miembro de un voluntariado que se form en ban y dije que desde la fortaleza se dirig a una banda de asaltantes
3172178 there was to be no lawkin arroond in the lecture rrroom
3172179 god it really makes it clear that a lot of these people dont think anybody young has got an opinion
3172180 i can tell you my dancers are extraordinarily good its a gorgeous show its very evocative and beautiful and very exciting and surprising
3172181 i am not afraid of beauty i dont think its embarrassing i love entertainment and i love a show
3172182 i choreograph only because of the existence of music i love music i listen to music all the time i am much more interested in music than in dancing i go to concerts i have a lot of it i read it
3172183 the evening sort of turned out to fit both bills and i adjusted it so that it would
3172184 id wanted to work with emmanuel and it turned out to be the exact sort of synergy of bodies
3172185 i have since done it with other people so it became a very big project on mozarts piano music it offers more mozart music than a straight music concert
3172186 there was a big movement of folk dancing in the states a lot of it was balkan dancing there is still a lot of folk and contra dancing at universities it was quite wonderful and i had a great experience and learned a lot about different kinds of dancing
3172187 permatang pauh has a big number of fence sitters who choose the candidate and not the party
3172188 it is important for us to pick the right candidate
3172189 my priority is to campaign against anwar and i support any candidate picked by bn
3172190 decision making must not be entirely made by someone at the top this is important to minimise delay in giving approvals and in making decisions
3172191 higher level officers must not be too involved in micro managing the process as this has caused delays in applications
3172192 the procedures must be liberalised and the forms simplified the delays are caused because we pay too much attention to unnecessary details
3172193 the forms we use for services in departments are too detailed the forms should be made simpler so that decisions can be given faster
3172194 we have improved but we have to achieve more because we have the advantage in resources or subsidies the government gives subsidies but this must not be taken for granted
3172195 there will come time when we no longer have that advantage or resource we must make sure that much effort is made to achieve competitiveness there are many countries which pay high prices for fuel but they are doing well there is no reason why we cannot do well under those circumstances
3172196 we must make the country more attractive such as having good governance peace and stability well trained and educated workforce conducive environment and favourable standard of living for its people and have a machinery that can approve fdi applications quickly
3172197 economic uncertainty and rising prices are a global phenomenon the government alone cannot address and insulate the nation from these global forces
3172198 all parties the government the corporate sector and the rakyat have a responsibility and role to play in safeguarding the nations prosperity
3172199 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3172200 its hard to believe it because i know how he andrews is
3172201 knowing him he could be playing a joke on all of us
3172202 there are a number of potential reasons why proton pump inhibitors might have this effect but we need to do further research to answer those questions
3172203 someone might have very mild heartburn that could easily be managed with other medications such as tums or zantac who are prescribed a proton pump inhibitor
3172204 and then it works but no one ever thinks of stepping down the therapy
3172205 and there are a lot of people we know who arent on these medications
3172206 however there are also people who get prescribed these medications and dont know why there is obviously appropriate use but there is inappropriate overuse and inappropriate underuse
3172207 im comfortable at this point with saying if youre only going to be on this medication a short time dont worry if youre going to be on it a long time the jurys still out as to what you should do
3172208 if youre on one of these medications and think you may be at risk for osteoporosis or you have osteoporosis or youve had a fracture in the past its a good time for you to make an appointment with your doctor to discuss why youre on these medications
3172209 i think the message is that first of all we need a different approach to try to confirm this
3172210 but also the message is strong enough now that patients and physicians should be aware that this is a potential harmful side effect and these medications should not be used casually which they sometimes are because they really dont have too many other side effects
3172211 one of the attributes the next mca president should have is the ability to speak out for the chinese community and for malaysians of all races and religions
3172212 so far i have not heard much from my partys senior leaders about how they feel about what happened at last saturdays bar council forum on the effects of conversion to islam
3172213 perhaps they are still busy campaigning some of my partys leaders are also busying themselves with talk about morality and apologies instead of making a stand on an issue which concerns us all

3172226 we are strengthening our commitment to r amp d throughout disney by establishing labs with carnegie mellon university and eth zurich
3172227 extending our r amp d efforts to these top notch university partners will take our internal initiatives to a new level
3172228 well be looking for ways to sense what a person is doing or thinking so that the character can respond appropriately
3172229 whether the character is a robot or a virtual creation the interaction issues are the same we need to figure out what sensors to build and how to interpret and respond to human behavior
3172230 the access disney provides to real world problems and data will enable us to do research with greater impact than is typically possible within a purely academic environment
3172231 at the same time disney research in pittsburgh can tap expertise at carnegie mellon that can be applied to problems that cut across all of disneys business units
3172232 we have been looking for a partner like disney to create synergies that will open up a wide spectrum of different fields in entertainment technology
3172233 our research will explore novel algorithms to bring both traditional animation and 3d computer animation to the next level of perfection we will investigate how artistic knowledge and rules can be incorporated into computer assisted production and content creation additionally we plan to design the next generation of cinematographic technology
3172234 tradition is that when the economy goes south so do womens hemlines longer hemlines demand more glamorous hairstyles which are softer not only in cut but also in color
3172235 fall fashions are showing much longer hemlines this year and were seeing much more demand for more feminine hairstyles as well
3172236 tone on tone a softer dimensional color that doesnt have as strong a line of demarcation
3172237 the objective is to achieve a style that doesnt require frequent touch ups which allows one to go longer between appointments
3172238 bangs have taken a back seat recently but theyre on the fashion runway big time this fall
3172239 more of a softer flirty look that offers options in styling they can be worn down swept to the side or blended when worn back
3172240 when the economy goes down everyone in fashion knows that lipstick sales go up
3172241 the theory is women buy more lipstick in brighter colors to cheer themselves up
3172242 and right now a lot of us need a boost in spirits
3172243 viread will be an important new treatment option and its approval represents a significant step forward in the fight against chronic hepatitis b
3172244 the approval of viread for hepatitis b represents more than a decade of work in both the fields of hiv and hepatitis b to develop a medication that offers significant viral suppression once daily dosing and a well established safety profile
3172245 we extend our thanks to the investigators and patients who participated in the clinical trials that support todays approval and we look forward to partnering with community members to increase disease awareness and expand access to treatment for those patients in need
3172246 although weve made great strides in reducing the overall incidence of chronic hepatitis b in the united states the disease still takes a devastating toll in asian american communities
3172247 greater public awareness and effective new treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce this significant health disparity

3172254 he started going down the slide and immediately began screaming
3172255 he had burns on the top of his palms and the bottom of his palms
3172256 he also had a second degree burn on his abdomen and a second degree burn on his leg
3172257 second degree burns partial thickness as andrew had causes blisters causes pain there is a risk for infections those are burns that require specialized burn care
3172258 its never been an issue we have talked to the manufacturer hes going to look into it but at this point we feel this is an isolated incident and again very unusual
3172259 i didnt figure you would make plastic that would get that hot especially for a kids slide
3172260 cpsc has an open and active investigation into the serious burn injury which occurred on a plastic playground slide in st
3172261 most of the injuries involve falls and entrapments though burn injuries on metal slides have also been reported to our agency over the years
3172262 cpsc and astm international the voluntary standards body that develops playground standards advise that lighter colored plastic slides hold less heat and may be safer

3172265 last week funimation exercised a power of attorney agreement to remove online fansubbed videos of monochrome factor nabari no ou and katekyo hitman reborn pictured at right on behalf of d rights the japanese production company of these anime titles funimation and d rights agreement also covers bamboo blade and el cazador de la bruja
3172266 the power of attorney agreement does not necessarily mean that these titles have a north american video distributor but the agreement does enforce d rights existing worldwide copyrights for these series
3172267 i think it was the ideal setup here because the first rounds were tough with the course firm fast and bouncy
3172268 then it softened up and the fans got what they wanted excitement when the pin is tough like on 17 and its a lottery to get the ball on the right level maybe they could let the green soften up enough so we could fire it in there i think the fans would have seen exciting golf there
3172269 i wish they would give us a little more freedom out there so that we have a chance to make birdies
3172270 the courses are set up so tough that you cant come out early and post a low number to catch somebody it just doesnt happen

3172274 america is no longer what it could be what it once was
3172275 i know my country has not perfected itself at times weve struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people
3172276 got older that gut instinct that america is the greatest country on earth would survive my growing awareness of our nations imperfections its ongoing racial strife the perversion of our political system laid bare during the watergate hearings the wrenching poverty of the mississippi delta and the hills of appalachia

3172309 no one is expecting a burger and chips to be super healthy
3172310 however i think a lot of people would be surprised to find out just how unhealthy some fast food options are
3172311 if youre not sure about something just rub it against a piece of paper if the paper turns clear its your window to weight gain
3172312 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3172313 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3172314 after doing some reading on this fabulous website i see my basic rudimentary first grade mistake i was looking to invest all of my nest and with a moderate 7 to 10 return could live nicely i guess thats the stock trader and futures trader in me coming out
3172315 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
3172316 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3172317 the amazingly high prices being paid for well fleshed cows should encourage breeders to clear out poor performers but no one should be cashing these in without immediately buying in replacements
3172318 it is sensible to improve future herd performance by getting rid of sub fertile animals and bad doers but it would be a mistake to be tempted into herd reduction just because an uncommonly high number of heavy cull cows are now being sold for 1 000 or more
3172319 farmers who have been clever enough to keep hold of their cows should ask themselves if they are still being clever to finally get rid of them at almost exactly the time the suckled calf sector is about to enjoy a change of fortune
3172320 ne sont pas pour la r volution ou qui nont rien fait pour elle
3172321 it doesnt look anything like it did but its fun to work with my old teachers
3172322 everything we do is brand new the war chant the fight song we all wrote the fight song as a team said wagner
3172323 its wonderful having a nice clean room to start from scratch
3172324 dont come to our house again because if you do ive got guns
3172325 i have got an air rifle and i have got a pistol and i am going to shoot the fucking vandals who come around here
3172326 go on then shoot me you silly old woman he said he was so near now that i worried he might try to grab the pistol but i knew that if i backed off i would lose face as if to reinforce this he slowly moved his right foot right up against mine toe to toe move your foot i said he didnt i pointed the gun at his foot still he didnt move i obviously wasnt going to shoot him so i moved it to the side of his foot and shot it at the pavement it was as if to say i could have done it but i didnt the gun made a pathetic puff i had his attention now so i fired the gun twice more at the tarmac away from us
3172327 im very sorry for what i did and realise i shouldnt be allowed to do that
3172328 but before i did that my life was totally intolerable because i didnt know what was going to happen next
3172329 im not having anybody bully my kids john said it was like a lioness with her cubs id had enough of them targeting my children
3172330 i dont bear any animosity towards those who targeted the family home now they dont give us grief any more i feel i have had far more damage done to me by the police they could have done something about stopping what was going on they could have helped us more
3172331 i had become ensconced in a world where extreme behaviour was the norm and ceased to be shocked by it
3172332 the pupils were out of control and it felt like a pressure cooker ready to blow
3172333 school was a very stressful place to work and i think i was still grieving for my mum who had recently died but what was driving me to despair was the fear that in some way the attacks on our home were related to my boys and i feared for their safety
3172334 this was the lowest sanction tantamount to a telling off
3172335 i was really pleased i didnt feel vindicated but i did feel i now had some credibility again the panel had risked public criticism to impose the lowest sanction against me and i was grateful
3172336 the utter futile frustration of being incarcerated isolated removed from my life the agony of separation from those i love and the pain of those who love me the boredom the waste of precious time the removal of free will
3172337 theres nothing at all wrong with your lovely shoulders it would be pointless immoral and greedy for me to start hacking or sucking away at them i would only be taking advantage of your low self esteem so just go home and learn to love your shoulders
3172338 this procedure is for people who are usually already in great shape and are very trim
3172339 a fascinating story of the harsh way in which a troubled community treats its eccentrics a partially sighted albino woman and her bird watching son are alienated as their mining village is destroyed weird but wonderful
3172340 do bugger all according to specialist sports doctor catherine spencer smith
3172341 we need to get them active so their generation doesnt die before us
3172342 building up as much bone mineral density as possible is vital
3172343 hopping running skipping jumping off things and rapid twisting are all important
3172344 if a child is old enough and sensible enough to follow instructions say from the age of 11 a programme of light weights and high repetitions is a good idea
3172345 it is safe provided they are supervised the technique is good and crucially that they are not lifting weights that are too heavy a good rule to follow is that if they cannot easily do 10 repetitions the weights are too heavy
3172346 im lucky ive never had any real injuries perhaps because my limbs are in alignment during activities thanks to proper instruction from an early age
3172347 it is also good to do some posture work such as pilates yoga alexander technique or balancing exercises on a fitball or swiss ball
3172348 anything involving balance is good and it doesnt have to be a formal organised activity dance is great at this age you may well be a desk slave so it is particularly important to develop good postural habits it is also a good idea to become accustomed to doing some kind of regular exercise for example cycling or jogging to destress
3172349 if you are overweight or sedentary you may well experience fertility issues exercise can help with hormone regulation and increase the possibility of conception
3172350 thereafter a whole series of things is going on its like having a car when there are a few miles on the clock things start to break down our resting heart rate increases and our muscle mass and strength decrease
3172351 increasing our youthfulness and vitality and improving our skin tone so it is important to do short intense bursts of activity at this age rather than thinking that fitness is all about building endurance whatever cardiovascular activity you do be it indoor rowing running swimming or triathlon make sure you also do strength training you can lose loads of weight doing endurance work but weight training develops the whole body
3172352 we can prevent decline in physical function later in life by pinpointing and dealing with problems now
3172353 compound moves such as squats deadlifts and bench presses done with medium to heavy weights are the key
3172354 free weights are better than machines as they improve functional strength and work the core and again proper instruction is important youre looking at four sets of each exercise of about six to 10 repeats so youre targeting your fast twitch muscle fibres muscle fibres used for intense sprint type movements as opposed to slow twitch fibres used for endurance exercise the more muscle mass you have the higher your metabolic rate and the more fat you burn when youre resting if you are new to weight training though start slowly you have to precondition your body
3172355 while we cant turn back the tide we can slow the rate of decrease a classic cause of disability in elderly people is falling because of loss of balance before we reach that stage if we can reduce the slowing down of the nervous system we can reduce the likelihood of falling when were older
3172356 try doing it with your eyes closed all the muscles twitch and at first you might panic then you start to improve
3172357 low impact exercise is best it is all about protecting the knees and hips
3172358 without wishing to sound depressing were not talking about building strength but decreasing the decline
3172359 its not about throwing the towel in its about being realistic
3172360 anything that can promote the idea of standing up balancing stretching and breathing bringing in all that coordination has got to be good
3172361 you can play them with a limited level of mobility get a really good cardiovascular workout and socialise
3172362 the balance and stability that the poles provide help to reduce the risk of falling regardless of the environment so it can mean the difference between going out and exercising and doing nothing at all
3172363 as you get older its more important than ever to get the right gear
3172364 as we age our thermoregulation isnt so good so it may be an idea to wear more layers of sports clothing when you exercise
3172365 and the more supple you are the better if your balance isnt great to start with do static stretching and if you can manage something more dynamic go for gentle yoga or pilates
3172366 rabid left wingers looking for any scrap of information that would reinforce their fantasy world while ignoring the mountains of information contradicting themselves
3172367 uh we dont know anything about georgia what now dude wikipedia

3172369 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia
3172370 georgia is an ancient country at the crossroads of eastern europe and central asia and one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
3172371 following fraudulent parliamentary elections in 2003 a peaceful democratic revolution took place led by the u
3172372 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable
3172373 in recent days moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the georgian region of south ossetia
3172374 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3172375 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3172376 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u
3172377 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3172378 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3172379 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3172380 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3172381 well i feel like im over here a good bit and i just wanted to help out

3172383 the mayor was not a politician he wanted everything good for glens falls
3172384 it was a very proud moment for him because he was going through the buildings and hearing all the people ooh and ahh its because of him that we have it
3172385 i have lost a dear personal friend someone i have known most of my life i will miss him i will miss his counsel i will miss just knowing he was here doing what he loved
3172386 wed just as soon get the bad weather over with before we open
3172387 we have full blacktop all the way around the fairgrounds you can stay out of the mud when there is mud unfortunately there is no crowd when its raining but if you want to come and see the fair its actually a good day to be here
3172388 at least its not a hundred degrees this is comfortable to work in you get a little wet but its no worse than a shower
3172389 we dont worry about it we take it day by day the good lord gives us what hes gonna give us and we work around it
3172390 its entirely the bottom line if we have a bad year its going to be very difficult to get to next year
3172391 i feel bad for the fair they only have six days to make as much as they can it hurts the community more than it hurts us

3172406 auditory or visual auditory responses in the primary visual cortex are highly probable given the presence of direct projections from the primary auditory cortex
3172407 we looked for modulation of the neuronal visual responses in the primary visual cortex by auditory stimuli in an awake monkey
3172408 our findings show that single neurons from one primary sensory cortex can integrate information from another sensory modality
3172409 our results argue against a strict hierarchical model of sensory integration in the brain and that integration of multiple senses should be added to the list of functions of the primary visual cortex

3172412 all moors can cope with some harriers but few gamekeepers allow any of these predators to breed because of the fear that numbers will subsequently flourish a ceiling scheme is a way of encouraging grouse managers to put an end to illegal killing of harriers safe in the knowledge that numbers will not reach densities where they can threaten the viability of their grouse moors
3172413 if successful this could prove to be a way to both minimise the local impact of predation on grouse moors and increase the national population of harriers providing a win win situation for harrier conservation and grouse management
3172414 hunters have been slow to recognise that illegal killing of raptors is unacceptable in 21st century society where there is strong support for conservation conservationists on the other hand have been unwilling to compromise over any form of intervention to limit harrier densities citing european legislation which prevents such action
3172415 we feel that a fundamental change in attitude is required from all parties to resolve the conflict between harriers and grouse if those involved genuinely wish to strive for a solution then compromises will be required and attitudes to predators their control and their protection will have to be modified to accommodate changed circumstances
3172416 our earlier work showed that feeding harriers can greatly reduce predation rates on grouse chicks however we still do not know how feeding will affect harrier numbers in the long term and indeed whether fed harriers and grouse shooting can coexist
3172417 some of these issues will be addressed by ongoing work at langholm however we suggest that the quickest way of finding an effective solution to this problem is to simultaneously make progress on different fronts it is sensible to test a harrier ceiling now and not wait for ten years until the langholm moor demonstration project is complete
3172418 rielle is a private individual she is not running for public office she wishes to maintain her privacy and her daughters privacy rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future

3172420 it went by real fast it was like a blur i remember when i was a rookie and everything is just a blur it wasnt a blur from the defensive side because i could actually see what was going on defensively but just trying to recall the information and my responsibilities as quarterback with each play it went by pretty fast
3172421 i take big pride in protecting the football especially in the red zone ill clean that up work on that mistake
3172422 if you ask every guy what we see out of chad that ball comes out on time receivers turn their heads and its almost hitting them in the face sometimes its amazing to see that on day one
3172423 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
3172424 when you enjoy doing what youre doing which i do very much i have something to get up for
3172425 charles has this great almost magical gift of melody an unending well of it
3172426 what he does seems very easy and most people think it is to write these simple melodies that stick in your head and never go away
3172427 charles works like a fiend he gets up in the morning and he goes to the piano and he works almost to the exclusion of everything else its the love of his life his work he adores barbara his wife and the kids but hes really obsessed with working
3172428 i started playing piano accompaniment for a lot of singers suddenly i was in nightclubs strip joints i used to play on 52nd street i always had a feeling for jazz even when i was writing more serious works
3172429 i would write a song and i would orchestrate it and copy the parts
3172430 and rehearsal was the next day at 9 so at 4 in the morning i am crossing the lake with the parts still wet i just loved it i never was happier
3172431 we never stopped giving auditions and people never gave money at all the idea of using rock n roll everybody was so turned off
3172432 his agents would not let him sign the contract until he approved every word and note that lee and i wrote
3172433 which meant that we had to at great expense to the producer follow sammy all over the world we spent three years of our lives a week or so each month out in las vegas playing songs for him
3172434 what i love about the score is that it is just good old fashioned tunes
3172435 they are hummable they are great to listen to and really evokes the era of the 1920s
3172436 he is like most really great composers quick to tear something up if somebody says it doesnt work
3172437 he will do it 40 times on one song which is sort of what you have to do but you would be amazed at how many people dont
3172438 i want science to be taken seriously because after all its less ephemeral it has a more eternal aspect than whatever the politics of the day might be which of course gets the lead in the news
3172439 like computer viruses successful mind viruses will tend to be hard for their victims to detect if you are the victim of one the chances are that you wont know it and may even vigorously deny it
3172440 justifying space exploration because we get non stick frying pans is like justifying music because it is good exercise for the violinists right arm
3172441 the so called christian nations are the most enlightened and progressive but in spite of their religion not because of it the church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of galileo down to our own time when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against eve and every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition the greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before christian religion was born
3172442 due to his state of mind at the time there is a possibility that he did cross the centre line intentionally to take his own life and he did unfortunately take someone else with him
3172443 its really a tragic situation on both sides two families are grieving
3172444 at no point did we engage in a pursuit as far as lights and sirens we didnt want to escalate the situation
3172445 but we were in the process of trying to locate mr guliker and speak with him to deal with his own personal safety
3172446 he a potential witness informed me that the party has told them to decline
3172447 theyre sending a message to all these conservative witnesses that the party is watching
3172448 she was told it would be part of the national campaign
3172449 i was told by mr hudson that mr goudies campaign would be receiving money from the conservative party of canada for advertising
3172450 i thought mr hudson was going to send us money to help out with local advertising but then he said that the money would be coming in to mr goudies campaign from the conservative party of canada but would be going right back out to the conservative party of canada
3172451 its like walking a chicken past a pot of water and calling it chicken soup
3172452 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3172453 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3172454 the practice of the presence of god and the spiritual maxims
3172455 she seems to me full of good will but she would go faster than grace one does not become holy all at once

3172458 this movie was ok i cant say it was great definately not as good as the first but it is the middle movie in a trilogy
3172459 boring go see it in the cheapo theater for the plane crash
3172460 ignore the fact that this is a woody allen film it is nothing like his other neurotic works it is a great film that goes where you wont expect
3172461 this was a good film a little formulaic at times but enjoyable all the same
3172462 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species
3172463 going forward there are signs that sales activity might pick up a little as sellers start to re evaluate unrealistic asking prices however the current confused messages from the government regarding stamp duty risks damaging any returning confidence and may discourage mobility
3172464 with less spending money than ever higher petrol prices and busier lifestyles it makes perfect sense for consumers to turn to the internet to fulfill their shopping needs
3172465 the new figures show that consumers have wholeheartedly embraced online shopping and this trend is set to continue
3172466 with 15 million households having access to broadband connections shoppers have instant access to the global online high street
3172467 why do you think you were the best actor for this role
3172468 what kind of research did you do to prepare for this part
3172469 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
3172470 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that its a very unfortunate set of circumstances
3172471 we will have better situational awareness for whats happening on our networks so we can take actions that will help enhance the trust of the american people that we are protecting their information
3172472 the federal government has got an onslaught of cyberattacks from foreign entities and it needs to do something pretty quickly
3172473 this whole tic initiative has caused civilian agencies who one could argue are not as security savvy as the intelligence community and the defense department to really button things up
3172474 internet access if its not managed properly can provide security risks
3172475 the government is looking for a way to consolidate that access to make it easier and more efficient to apply appropriate security the government will see the benefits of this immediately
3172476 a style of computing where massively scalable it enabled capabilities are delivered as a service to external customers using internet technologies
3172477 as service provisions a critical aspect of cloud computing grow vendors must become or partner with service providers to deliver their technologies indirectly to users
3172478 user organizations will watch portfolios of owned technologies decline as service portfolios grow the key activity will be to determine which cloud services will be viable and when
3172479 this is an awful time for russia to be pumping out even more bad news
3172480 the commodity cycle is turning the whole house of cards in russia depends on oil and gas which makes up 60pc of state revenue commodities amount to 75pc of total exports
3172481 on top of that investors are rotating out of emerging markets in general chinas market has fallen hard
3172482 its easier to quickly lose investor confidence than it is to get it back unless the current conflict is resolved soon then quite likely we will see many more global funds abandoning ship in russia
3172483 russias market is highly vulnerable to a slowdown in global growth and a fall in commodity prices
3172484 commodity stocks under private or foreign control seem to have the greatest legal risk these include fertiliser producers and coal and steel companies
3172485 the equity market has been hit by a perfect storm of negative news in recent weeks while sentiment towards russia has shifted 180 degrees in the past month most of the fundamentals are unchanged any sign that the flow of bad news may abate will likely generate a substantial bounce
3172486 medvedev and putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the us and europe
3172487 it would save approximately 31 000 a year about 10 000 in bus fuel savings about 5500 on electricity and heating and then food supplies about 15 000
3172488 it would save us about 170 000 in transportation costs about 30 000 of that would be fuel alone
3172489 so its something i think that we would be interested in taking a look at i dont think its anything that we would be one of the first schools in the state
3172490 i dont believe kirksville as a whole would be in favor of it i believe it would have a negative impact on schedules of local patrons and work schedules i believe that it would have a negative educational impact
3172491 anything that you do cant be just because of dollar savings and things like that you have to do whats best for the kids what ends up helping them the most in their educational setting
3172492 well i think you have to weigh the cost against the educational value or expense

3172494 our investors already know that were perfectly all right a lot of our business is via segregated managed funds so they can see their assets very clearly
3172495 lack of demand due to market funds non availability for the bottom end of the market has caused the market to slow almost to a stop

3172500 it is too early to estimate how much oil has been discovered in this well bore but we do believe that as a consequence of this discovery there is a relatively high probability that this area could contain enough oil and gas to double revuss current reserves and contingent resources

3172517 love your peppermint foot lotion it keeps my feet so soft
3172518 rather than using the lower pound to boost their competitiveness exporters are still using it as an opportunity to raise their selling prices and boost their profits
3172519 while pipeline price pressures in the uk economy remain very strong there is some tentative evidence that they may be close to a peak
3172520 after russian president medvedev said the operation was finished the market turned around and went up
3172521 given russias overwhelming military advantage we would expect any potential combat to be short lived with the two sides back at the negotiation table in a matter of days or weeks
3172522 such a scenario would imply only limited impact on russias fiscal outlook suggesting that any potential rouble and spread weakness in the short term could provide an attractive entry point

3172530 designers seem to think that because youre big you dont have curves you are just a blob were not a blob we have curves we go in at the same place as a size 10 but we just start a bit bigger
3172531 i love my fashion magazines and watching all my fashion shows things like this and it just seems like its a world thats excluded to me im just on the outside looking in
3172532 you just feel youre so discriminated against you see these gorgeous clothes on the high street and you think id really really like that but i could never go in this shop i wouldnt even attempt to go in just to have a look
3172533 you see all these beautiful clothes and you cant go anywhere near them its like theyre ring fenced by barbed wire
3172534 i really really hope they just take on the retailers and say to them why arent you doing more maybe theyll listen to trinny and susannah rather than nobodies like us
3172535 with your help we are going to be speaking to a group of young designers and they are going to design a collection of clothes based around you guys you will then be the models of these clothes and were going to wear them at a location yet to be revealed
3172536 if we cant help create better outfits than are out there already its like admitting to the retailers their clothing is fine and to me that is failing nearly half the women in britain
3172537 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3172538 with a little dns spoofing i fed my own list into the iphone and effectively killed by name applications that attempt to use the gps it looks like thats all its set to do right now but i may just not have found the vaporize switch
3172539 either it is an anti malware solution and the iphone has a switch somewhere to vaporize any app or its not an anti malware solution and is really designed to kill applications that interfere with apples business model such as unsanctioned traffic navigation software
3172540 unless for some reason they decided to build two separate mechanisms into the iphone to do this of which the other one is invisible this one likely feeds a master kill switch perhaps there is a special setting in the configuration file which can vaporize the app all together
3172541 you should never have been in that situation to begin with and again brings up the question is the iphone really an enterprise device
3172542 on the other hand how did the i am rich app get through
3172543 attack took about half of the day i e a bit less than 10 hours
3172544 so if you have a gige lan any trojaned machine can poison your dns during one night
3172545 while i think its bad that anybody who can hammer you at gige speed for ten hours can poison your cache its not a threat to the real world the way 11 seconds at 10 megabit was
3172546 any dns server with a host based firewall can implement a 100 percent effective mitigation for the polyakov attack and its possible that an upstream outboard firewall could also be made to do it
3172547 at some point isc will have to put logic like this into bind of course but protecting against the polyakov attack is like synflood protection in that its a rate limit problem
3172548 its long past time for secure dns which is a combination of tsig tkey sig 0 and dnssec end to end crypto authentication

3172564 estimates for private equity investments in the first half of 2008 are down between 30pc and 40pc on the same period last year
3172565 the private equity market did not feel the effects of the credit crunch until very late last year
3172566 investments last year rose to record levels for the third year running but we are heading for a fall this year
3172567 the volatile global capital market conditions make business conditions uncertain
3172568 how would the public react if 80pc of the drugs available to doctors were suddenly removed by the eu because thats whats happening in agriculture
3172569 the only thing that will happen is yields will be hit and food prices will have to rise
3172570 at a time when governments are obsessed with food security and prices its ironic that they are trying to set us back by decades
3172571 this impact assessment is based only on a worst case scenario and on unrealistic figures
3172572 in fact the commission proposal would affect only a few substances which are the most problematic ones for human health and the environment
3172573 the european commission isnt thinking about the effects this legislation will have on food prices
3172574 its a real concern for people who have low economic status and are already struggling to find the money for fresh food
3172575 while the us economy has avoided recession to date the major economies are experiencing a generalised slowdown
3172576 weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asia economies
3172577 we are aware of the review in the meantime we will be talking with both parties to seek a resolution to the situation

3172580 currently processors and retailers seem mildly concerned over future milk production but at todays prices they have convinced themselves that in late autumn and early winter farmers will push hard for extra milk from their cows
3172581 i couldnt disagree more i do not think that milk production will do anything more than continue to drop like a stone unless farmers become confident that reasonable and profitable milk prices will be paid in the longer term and that does not even appear to be on the horizon
3172582 even if a sufficiently high price movement comes along now the earliest production would start to increase in earnest is probably late in 2009 and i am not convinced that will happen bovine tuberculosis for starters will take out more than 200 million litres
3172583 dairy farmers of britain the co operative with more than 2 300 producers is offering members what it calls a seasonality bonus that lifts the 25 2p per litre standard price to as high as 37 5p for all the extra milk produced from september to december but that will not help much remember milk volume increases do little to raise prices if volumes go up the retailers will think that the current price is more than satisfactory the less milk farmers produce the more they should receive for each litre
3172584 on top of the mistrust that is out there producers are far more alert to the real market value of milk than ever before and are prepared to jump ship if their buyers do not come up with the goods
3172585 other farmers have simply had a gutful of accepting what they are given and are simply seeing their time out or are making the most of good cull and stock prices to leave the sector now
3172586 processors and retailers had better stop worrying about this winters production and write it off because the damage is done they should instead focus on what can be achieved to stabilise production in 2009 and act sooner rather than later
3172587 obviously we are very pleased with the companys strong earnings thus far in 2008 and particularly in the second quarter
3172588 as was announced at the time the membership of usw local 11 0001 which represents union employees at the east boulder mine ratified a new four year labor agreement on july 8 2008 without experiencing any labor interruption
3172589 at june 30 2008 the last of our outstanding forward sales commitments covering a substantial portion of our mined platinum production finally settled out the company entered into these forward sales commitments several years ago in order to protect the company against a decline in platinum prices while we were spending heavily to re establish the developed state of the mines as the price of platinum continued to rise though they have cost us substantially over the past couple of years losses on these forward hedging transactions reduced our sales revenues by 5 8 million in the second quarter and 12 8 million in the first half of 2008 at present we have no plans for any further hedging of our mine production
3172590 mine production in this years second quarter at 126 200 ounces was a little below last years second quarter production
3172591 the companys total cash costs per pgm ounce produced 1 averaged 394 in the second quarter of 2008 quite a bit higher than the 320 per ounce in last years second quarter more than half of this increase was attributable to higher operating costs particularly for power and contractor services and the remainder to lower mine production in the second quarter of 2008 compared to last years second quarter our initial guidance for 2008 full year total cash costs was between 355 and 375 per ounce in view of our reduced production forecast for 2008 along with record high energy prices we have revised our earlier guidance for 2008 total cash costs we now believe total cash costs for 2008 will fall in the range of 380 to 395 per ounce
3172592 operationally progress continues on our mine transformation efforts safety and environmental performance continued strong during the quarter we have implemented recommendations from a third party safety audit conducted during the first quarter that are intended to help drive our incident rates toward zero construction is now under way on the second smelter furnace in columbus it should be fully operational by the end of 2008 or early in 2009 as noted last quarter we believe this furnace once in operation will increase our processing capacity and provide a strategically critical back up facility during scheduled or unscheduled furnace outages total production from selective mining methods at the stillwater mine was at 86 of the new mill feed while east boulder averaged only 56 at this time we do not expect any significant change in these levels due to the tight labor markets we are currently seeing in the mining industry along with these tight markets for seasoned miners we are renewing our focus on how we can improve and accelerate our existing miner training efforts
3172593 another of stillwaters corporate objectives is to foster new market demand for its primary products
3172594 we also are working toward diversifying the companys asset base
3172595 as i have commented before these investments in generative exploration projects are inherently long term and fairly speculative in nature but are intended to give us access to seasoned exploration teams and build a portfolio of attractive opportunities for the future we also actively track various later stage mineral development projects and operating properties to identify those that might offer good investment value and mesh with stillwaters corporate expertise we are proceeding deliberately in these growth and diversification efforts
3172596 although the 2008 financial results to date are very gratifying we still have a lot on our plate and remain focused on adding value to stillwater over the longer term

3172605 to be honest thats the first time i ever heard that from either of those guys but any time anybody says something about guys on this team you take offense to it
3172606 bobby wade came here and developed got better and if he hadnt developed and gotten better the titans wouldnt have wanted him minnesota wouldnt have wanted him justin gage the same way if he hadnt have come here and gotten better he wouldnt have gone to tennessee and gotten 15 million or 16 million bernard berrian if he hadnt developed wouldnt have got 42 million with minnesota
3172607 i think one of the things that happened was the emergence of bernard he had to share some things there his role probably changed from what he was accustomed to
3172608 but we know we need to make a decision so we can start getting the timing and everything else going
3172609 it is a reminder to all that taking out comprehensive travel insurance is a crucial part of your holiday planning and not something that should be sacrificed to save a few pounds
3172610 our message is stay safe and have a great holiday
3172611 our study has shown that variation in the quality of care related to deprivation was reduced during the first three years of the financial incentive scheme
3172612 more than 60 per cent of the gap in life expectancy between the fifth of areas with the greatest material deprivation and poorest health in england and the rest of the country is attributable to diseases targeted in the incentive scheme particularly coronary heart diseases cancer and chronic obstructive airways disease
3172613 westcon has been a strong partner but the relationship has changed recently and as a result we had a closer look at the partnership there was nothing specific that caused the split
3172614 were looking to expand on our relationship with ingram and we expect to be making further announcements regarding distribution partners in a few weeks
3172615 as we continue to refine our local and global strategy it is important we align our portfolio around key vendors that are both synergistic with our core competencies and deliver consistent growth and profitability for westcon group and our channel partners

3172628 any decision is going to take some time when companies are looking at a lengthy return on their investment over several years
3172629 but people are taking this decision particularly carefully in todays economic climate a decision that they would have found a lot easier and quicker in times gone by
3172630 we have seen a strong operational performance on the outsourcing contracts and the direct property investment portfolio and this has left us in a good cash position at the end of the first half
3172631 market conditions remain challenging but we expect the mapeley business model to continue to perform robustly
3172632 four of the past five months have now seen negative like for like annual sales growth and in july every sector except food recorded falls frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3172633 this is a good time for consumers to take advantage of the wide range of discounts and promotions available to them
3172634 the furniture and home related sectors continue to bear the brunt of falling consumer confidence and increasing demands on household budgets womens footwear was the only highlight in the clothing and related sectors perhaps suggesting a need for a personal treat in the midst of all the gloom
3172635 add to the mounting evidence that consumers are now significantly reining in their spending either out of choice or necessity in the face of mounting handicaps
3172636 they say they have access to an unidentified but substantial source of capital
3172637 running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to find the money to mount an offer

3172640 being loud and long is not necessarily factual or insightful
3172641 the total replacement value of the industrys mains and sewers and works is around 250bn in recent years spending on renewal has been around 2bn a year not exactly gold plating
3172642 realistic investment in renewing assets cant be put off indefinitely at least it cant without risking a fall off in service that customers would hate and could seriously damage the environment and the economy
3172643 against this background increased problems with customer debt will emerge as an issue for the water industry while we expect to see the many water companies increase their funding for schemes to assist vulnerable customers who will have difficulty meeting these proposed increases they are also likely to increase their efforts to collect from customers who can pay but wont and to target unbilled properties
3172644 we will now examine draft business plans in detail checking the proposed level of service and investment
3172645 we will make sure each plan includes everything we expect takes account of concerns expressed by customers and does so as efficiently as possible

3172649 however there has been a shocking lack of consultation with local authorities and disregard for the wishes of local people
3172650 some councillors are quite understandably furious that they have not been adequately consulted on what is happening in their area
3172651 its pure folly to dump this kind of accommodation into the middle of a residential street without properly asking for the councils views
3172652 there is nothing in the available data that indicates that the introduction of variable fees in england has yet had any lasting impact on the level or pattern of demand for full time undergraduate education
3172653 whilst it is encouraging that student numbers have not decreased in our universities it is extremely worrying that there has been no change in the number of students from the very backgrounds the government is spending considerable sums of money on persuading to apply
3172654 we remain unconvinced that asking students to pay more for a university education is the best way to encourage those from poorer backgrounds to apply
3172655 appears so far to have had no discernible impact on the mix of individuals applying to enter full time undergraduate programmes

3172657 it would be utterly unacceptable for russia to try and destabilise a democratically elected government on its border with a view to any sort of regime change

3172659 a sympathetic article about a 15 year old boy named saro who described his homosexual feelings and how gay straight alliance student clubs help such gay teens to deal with discrimination and bullying in high school and middle school
3172660 is the danger of young sexually confused teens self identifying as gays at an early age research has shown that the risk of suicide decreases by 20 each year that a person delays homosexual or bisexual self labeling early self identification is dangerous to kids
3172661 my work has been cited by pfox in response to a washington post article on gay straight alliances gsa
3172662 pfox misuses one of my studies on suicide attempts in gay youth to argue that people should not identify their sexual orientation at young ages our findings do not support the contention that young people choose their identity or the timing of events in identity formation nor is there any evidence that the availability of gsas influences those developmental processes
3172663 we thank dr remafedi for stepping forward and not allowing his research to be manipulated for political gain
3172664 the right wing thrives on twisting legitimate research in its efforts to confuse people we are doing everything in our power to stop this insidious practice
3172665 yet again the consumer is being hit with inflation busting price rises each month we are currently seeing a different utility company increase its prices
3172666 our latest research findings show that a quarter of the uk now see eating three meals a day as a luxury the costs of basic essential items like water bills are now pushing many people across the uk towards poverty
3172667 its slightly perplexing because for the first time in a decade we have massive changes in the ability of individuals to raise finance through mortgages because many lenders are short but in the sme sector it is a shortage of demand thats the problem
3172668 the advertising downturn has hit september trading hard and we expect continuing pressure in the second half

3172701 in the eyes of the horse he saw the suffering of all mankind and he had no choice but one choice to reach out and save one lone creature from the fate of suffering and murder when we make the only choice possible and that is to love then all of us become what we were intended to be we are the power

3172712 initially i wanted to use video projections as a kind of lighting
3172713 i wanted to know whether it was possible for a projector to understand where dancers are rather than working with pre rendered video i wanted video that could respond to movement

3172716 that allows the performers to create the sense that this is happening now its never happened this way before and it wont happen the same way again
3172717 for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
3172718 it is still an open question for the future whether this small group of neanderthals was a general feature or was this caused by some bottleneck in their population size that happened late in the game
3172719 theres no proof that they saw each other only that they inhabited the same place at about the same time but i think its likely that they came across one another
3172720 what weve done is confirm that the mitochondrial dna of neanderthals and modern humans was so different that it forms powerful evidence that there was very little if any interbreeding between the two species
3172721 we have also got tantalising evidence that the neanderthals formed a small population and we can only speculate as to what happened to them small population sizes are always more prone to extinction and they have a greater chance of something going wrong
3172722 the question then is whether when the populations met they regarded each other as simply people enemies aliens or even prey
3172723 we simply dont know the answer and the answer may have varied from one time and place to another especially given the vagaries of human behaviour

3172752 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
3172753 clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated
3172754 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

3172762 thats something we knew very early on and weve done our research on that
3172763 its very specific the first clause is 8 hours a day
3172764 thats because they dont just want to adopt a principle they want a standard specific time frame
3172765 theres a repealing of the 8 hour work day in statute that kind of supports that in utah code in 1969 where instituted the 40 hour work week which a lot of our employees have been on

3172773 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3172774 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3172775 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3172776 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3172777 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3172778 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing

3172798 progress to date has been hindered by the never ending hurdles that have been imposed upon us to date costing several hundreds of thousands of dollars as opposed if the development was done a few years earlier
3172799 unfortunately we could not start the development prior to getting common wealth government aged care bed licenses
3172800 with the hurdles to date it has not been possible to finalise any financial loan arrangements with the banks
3172801 as a show of our commitment to the project we have funded the works to date from our own capital this is now to the stage that we have almost depleted our own funds
3172802 we remain of the view that the financing is renegotiable and that trading issues will begin to nominalise with todays statement providing encouragement on both these fronts we do not feel this is currently reflected in the shares which are currently trading on 4 7 times our cy09 expectation

3172827 she has shown incredible strength in the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it and there have been a lot of tears and hugs the fact that shes able to get in amongst it and already be able to address what happened is a testament to her strength of character

3172838 including a high level and neutral international mediator and a genuine international peacekeeping force not simply russian troops

3173121 increasing fines is not a solution to the problem its a one sided approach penalizing only the drivers
3173122 this attack which once again shows the ugly face of terrorism demonstrates plainly how far the terrorists are from human values
3173123 the pkk has been increasingly using explosives since 2004 materials are cheap and they can be easily found they have also learned to inflict damage by using such explosives from their counterparts in iraq and afghanistan
3173124 the terror organization executes such hit and run strikes when it is losing its influence because these types of terror acts are less costly but can still cause much damage when it is able to take an initiative it plans raids on military and security posts
3173125 in the eyes of the europeans today the pkk is an organization involved in every type of illegal act from drug to human trafficking
3173126 the pkk has been bothered as turkey maintains its rational policies and does not panic over the terrorist attacks the pkk desires uproar but turkey keeps quiet therefore the pkk plans terrorist acts whenever it can
3173127 it used ergenekon as a way to make the waters murky the pkk wanted to imply that the bombing might well have been the job of the deep state even though that might not be the case so the pkk killed two birds with one stone
3173128 however who is the pkk now and what is it it has started losing its own hierarchy we can expect atypical attacks from it
3173129 think about the attack in the northern iraqi city of kirkuk which killed 23 people on july 28 and the bombings in stanbul the night before they were not able to incite a turkish kurdish conflict in turkey but they did it in kirkuk
3173130 the conflict in the caucasus will possibly lead to more ethnic uprisings in the region and the terrorist groups in turkey would like to take advantage of this development
3173131 we are in a period in which military powers are starting to take precedence russia and the us are taking their positions in this period they want to avoid china and europe which are seen as the economic powers of peaceful times so turkey might get caught in the scene of that fight for power

3173159 south ossetia might seem like beautiful distant confetti lost in the caucasus but the fighting taking place there must be taken very seriously
3173160 calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities are needed as is insistence on moscows compliance with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders but to impose such fine principles well have to make them forget the precedent of the unilateral independence of kosovo which the kremlin brandishes to justify its intervention in support of the georgian separatists
3173161 is nato going to risk a war with russia to save georgia in bombing the base where u s instructors are stationed the russian air force has pointed its finger at western impotence now that moscow has unleashed its tanks and planes into the battle georgia doesnt stand a chance he conflict between moscow and tbilisi has been brewing for a long time now that war is at the gates of our continent the european union under the french presidency must regain the initiative to ensure that relations with russia dont irreversibly deteriorate

3173231 too many of these small coastal cetaceans end up as bycatch in fisheries this remains the main threat to them and it is only going to get worse
3173232 river dolphins are one of the most threatened cetacean categories mainly because they are locked in competition with humans for dwindling freshwater resources
3173233 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3173234 disentanglement programmes to release whales captured in fishing gear already carried out in the united states new zealand and australia help some individuals survive
3173235 however areas of critical habitat need to be closed to certain types of fishing at least seasonally to ensure the survival of some species
3173236 large parts of the oceans are now filled with human generated noise not only from military sonar but also from seismic surveys and shipping this noise undoubtedly affects many cetaceans in some cases leading to their death
3173237 it may not always kill whales and dolphins but it affects their ability to communicate and it can drive them away at least temporarily from their feeding grounds
3173238 we have now treated 93 patients with metastatic melanoma using their own anti tumour cells with a response rate slowing of disease or shrinking of tumours of 72 per cent about three times better than any other treatment
3173239 the southern ocean is a hotspot for climate research because its circulation is critical to understanding the earths climate and its huge ice sheet is sensitive to climate change
3173240 southern elephant seals are wide ranging predators that roam all over the southern ocean even under the sea ice in the wintertime a time when conventional ocean observation methods are unable to gather data
3173241 i think this is an extremely exciting new approach for ocean observation which has now been extended to seals roaming the seas around both poles as part of the international polar year ipy
3173242 the on going marine mammals exploring the oceans pole to pole meop project has equipped 100 seals from three polar species with oceanographic sensors which now routinely send large quantities of near real time information from previously uncovered polar regions

3173247 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3173248 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

3173266 it was a fairly big stuff up by the guest and when she was asked why she did it she said she had no idea and she was upset and disappointed with herself she left next day

3173274 andrea adds excitement to the fire house and has become a mentor for many of the recruits
3173275 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3173276 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3173277 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3173278 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscar
3173279 it is where all the excitement is today it is technology that companies are hearing about and thinking that it is going to change the way they manage all of their desktop pcs
3173280 pc virtualization is the next wave but it is not going to be a tsunami or a tidal wave it is going to take time
3173281 it is such early days that i dont think anybody is willing to say that there is a clear winner
3173282 fruit is generally expensive in japan and people often buy grapes peaches and melons as luxury gifts japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high end fruits especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year

3173284 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3173285 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3173286 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3173287 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3173288 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3173289 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing

3173293 its completely untrue ridiculous ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
3173294 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
3173295 wealth is about so much more than pounds or euros or dollars can ever measure its time we admitted that theres more to life than money its time we focused not just on gdp but on gwb general well being
3173296 it would be nice if you would dispose of your litter

3173300 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me
3173301 it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped which 25 did they think i was responsible for
3173302 its so appalling the number of women that are probably getting this letter and arent fighting because they dont know that they can
3173303 cica makes decisions on conduct issues in good faith based on the facts available to them in each individual case and any applicants unhappy with the decision in their claim can ask for a review by a more senior member of staff
3173304 an inquiry into how the investigation was handled was carried out by the mets directorate of professional standards following receipt of a complaint from the victim in 2005 this resulted in one officer a police constable receiving a written warning and another a detective constable who has transferred to another force receiving words of advice officers apologised to the victim concerned

3173315 tighter credit conditions in terms of both collateral requirements and generally wider lending margins is impairing housing market activity
3173316 in terms of the outlook the july survey lends further support to the notion that activity may be beginning to stabilise albeit at a low level
3173317 it has been an encouraging month for sales 25 up on june and just 20 down on july 2007
3173318 conditions are more difficult even than the 1990s because of a lack of first time buyers entering the market due to a lack of available mortgage funding
3173319 the only properties attracting any interest are those offered at greatly discounted prices ie repossessions new builds on large developments and the older rural properties the first time buyer is on the list of endangered species
3173320 with no let up in the housing market slowdown and the squeeze on incomes forward orders pointed to further slowdown
3173321 with shoppers increasingly cautious in spending tight budgets and now often seeing clothes as more of a discretionary purchase core basics childrenswear and clearance bargains sold well
3173322 even heavy discounting often failed to tempt customers to buy
3173323 the size of the award made by the court today reflects his talent and potential prior to the tackle as one of the brightest young footballers in the country
3173324 having said that ben would understandably have preferred to earn this sum through a full career as a professional footballer
3173325 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to hard work and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3173326 during his 11 years at manchester united he had impressed players and staff at all levels from sir alex ferguson and gary neville to the contemporaries who played alongside him
3173327 the tackle was high and over the ball and as a consequence the claimant suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula of his right leg
3173328 his positive attitude towards his injury and to the devastating blow of being unable to pursue his chosen career does him great credit
3173329 he was plainly intelligent and it is clear that he has brought and will in the future bring to his academic studies the same dedication and commitment that he formerly applied to football
3173330 the most remarkable student i have had the pleasure to teach
3173331 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
3173332 the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilise this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3173333 zanu pf is not talking about conceding any real power they are talking about giving up positions in cabinet but they want to remain in control these guys arent serious
3173334 the differences revolve around who will have power theyre not giving up anything on that they entered these negotiations solely to give up cosmetic issues
3173335 there is a lot of pressure on tsvangirai people in the party are telling him that he cannot agree to a deal that does not recognise the peoples will and democracy mugabe should not be allowed to keep power just because he terrorised the population into voting for him
3173336 the pressure for us is coming from the people they dont want to see some kind of half hearted change if we were to do that we would lose credibility if morgan takes something cosmetic from zanu pf he will lose the support of the zimbabwean people
3173337 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row then im not sharp
3173338 if i can sleep in until about 7 30 or 8 then it really helps me
3173339 i think when i get up real early like 5 30 or 6 and dont go to bed until 10 10 30 or 11 it seems to help me get up a little later in the morning
3173340 what happened today is important not only for bolivians but for all latin americans
3173341 i dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world
3173342 so whats going on here how can people in groups be both brilliant and idiotic one word interface
3173343 if you are on the enemys side or you are being used by western enemies stop it
3173344 the irritating ignorance political insensitivity double standards and patronizing arrogance that characterize western diplomacy with respect to our country
3173345 as we finalize the political settlement to the impasse in our country we have heard sentiments from the west indicating that they will look at the agreement and decide whether it is acceptable to them who are they to superintend judge and grade a collective decision by africans it is not the place for western governments or their institutions to determine whether the agreement is right or wrong it is strictly none of their business
3173346 mutambara is overzealous who seems to be writing for a zanu pf audience
3173347 he is trying to appease mugabe positioning himself for a powerful seat in a mugabe government
3173348 zimbabwe is at a standstill the business community is waiting for the outcome of the talks to move forward
3173349 the major hold up is the refusal by mugabe to cede his executive powers he is only agreeing to a nominal prime minister post for morgan tsvangirai
3173350 it looks like we have reached some kind of stalemate which is threatening the whole dialogue tsvangirai is moving goalposts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon
3173351 this is an issue that we had settled and he tsvangirai is also suggesting that he must be given full authority to appoint any new government
3173352 esto no cambia nuestra planificaci n tenemos que jugar siete partidos para conseguir lo que vinimos a buscar y al igual que en el debut tendremos que salir a ganar contra gran breta a hay que seguir igual

3173361 when you enjoy doing what youre doing which i do very much i have something to get up for
3173362 charles has this great almost magical gift of melody an unending well of it
3173363 what he does seems very easy and most people think it is to write these simple melodies that stick in your head and never go away
3173364 charles works like a fiend he gets up in the morning and he goes to the piano and he works almost to the exclusion of everything else its the love of his life his work he adores barbara his wife and the kids but hes really obsessed with working
3173365 i started playing piano accompaniment for a lot of singers suddenly i was in nightclubs strip joints i used to play on 52nd street i always had a feeling for jazz even when i was writing more serious works
3173366 i would write a song and i would orchestrate it and copy the parts
3173367 and rehearsal was the next day at 9 so at 4 in the morning i am crossing the lake with the parts still wet i just loved it i never was happier
3173368 we never stopped giving auditions and people never gave money at all the idea of using rock n roll everybody was so turned off
3173369 his agents would not let him sign the contract until he approved every word and note that lee and i wrote
3173370 which meant that we had to at great expense to the producer follow sammy all over the world we spent three years of our lives a week or so each month out in las vegas playing songs for him
3173371 what i love about the score is that it is just good old fashioned tunes
3173372 they are hummable they are great to listen to and really evokes the era of the 1920s
3173373 he is like most really great composers quick to tear something up if somebody says it doesnt work
3173374 he will do it 40 times on one song which is sort of what you have to do but you would be amazed at how many people dont
3173375 but i never said to myself how will i ever top this that never even occurred to me i mean i like things to be a success but the main thing is to keep working
3173376 lo cual aumentar la incertidumbre sobre todo cuando no hay hasta el momento autoridad que corrobore este mecanismo para reducir el subsidio a los combustibles
3173377 aunado a todo lo anterior est la expectativa de que los precios de bienes internacionales seguir n elevados por alg n tiempo m s lo cual complica la tarea de la pol tica monetaria que adem s de lidiar con los efectos externos ahora enfrenta presiones internas
3173378 un desequilibrio grave pero sobre todo la fortaleza que hasta ahora mantienen los fundamentales de la econom a mexicana
3173379 it is where all the excitement is today it is technology that companies are hearing about and thinking that it is going to change the way they manage all of their desktop pcs
3173380 pc virtualization is the next wave but it is not going to be a tsunami or a tidal wave it is going to take time
3173381 it is such early days that i dont think anybody is willing to say that there is a clear winner
3173382 i understand that were on a tight timeframe for farmers every day that it goes by that it doesnt rain is a day that farmers have to make tough decisions about their future we want to provide them with surety as soon as we can
3173383 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
3173384 if i still have luck i would come back to die on thai soil like every other thai person what happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
3173385 there is a continuation of dictatorship managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system these are my political enemies they do not care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3173386 clearly thaksin is very angry by the way things have turned out he is obviously extremely emotional theres a fighting tone hes not given up completely
3173387 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
3173388 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease
3173389 pamela had lost hope she wasnt able to make plans for the future she wasnt able to engage the day as if she had a future left
3173390 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
3173391 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
3173392 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
3173393 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
3173394 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
3173395 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems
3173396 look you never leave politics particularly with the birth of the liberal national party im 150 per cent behind the new party but you never say never
3173397 at this stage ive got a lot of family priorities that im pursuing
3173398 i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
3173399 one of the things the industry has long called for is to move on from a one size fits all mentality to one that reflects regional need customers will be hoping the regulator will reflect this regional diversity in the final determinations in 2009
3173400 our view is that realistic investment in renewing assets cant be put off indefinitely at least it cant without risking a fall off in service that customers would hate and could seriously damage the economy and the environment
3173401 some of this increase is also aimed for the first time at dealing with climate change related issues from improving the flood resilience of critical infrastructure to widespread plans to increase household metering
3173402 ofwat have a very difficult task in balancing the requirement for significant investment with customers priorities not to see bills increase more than is necessary
3173403 water and sewerage prices between 2010 and 2015 need to be set in line with what customers are willing and able to pay and companies should deliver a package of benefits in line with what consumers see as a priority
3173404 the consumer council for water has encouraged water companies to give extra back to consumers and this has resulted in 130m of benefits in two years we will take the same approach in pressing ofwat and the companies to be guided by the needs of consumers up to 2015
3173405 do bugger all according to specialist sports doctor catherine spencer smith
3173406 we need to get them active so their generation doesnt die before us
3173407 building up as much bone mineral density as possible is vital
3173408 hopping running skipping jumping off things and rapid twisting are all important
3173409 if a child is old enough and sensible enough to follow instructions say from the age of 11 a programme of light weights and high repetitions is a good idea
3173410 it is safe provided they are supervised the technique is good and crucially that they are not lifting weights that are too heavy a good rule to follow is that if they cannot easily do 10 repetitions the weights are too heavy
3173411 im lucky ive never had any real injuries perhaps because my limbs are in alignment during activities thanks to proper instruction from an early age
3173412 it is also good to do some posture work such as pilates yoga alexander technique or balancing exercises on a fitball or swiss ball
3173413 anything involving balance is good and it doesnt have to be a formal organised activity dance is great at this age you may well be a desk slave so it is particularly important to develop good postural habits it is also a good idea to become accustomed to doing some kind of regular exercise for example cycling or jogging to destress
3173414 if you are overweight or sedentary you may well experience fertility issues exercise can help with hormone regulation and increase the possibility of conception
3173415 thereafter a whole series of things is going on its like having a car when there are a few miles on the clock things start to break down our resting heart rate increases and our muscle mass and strength decrease
3173416 increasing our youthfulness and vitality and improving our skin tone so it is important to do short intense bursts of activity at this age rather than thinking that fitness is all about building endurance whatever cardiovascular activity you do be it indoor rowing running swimming or triathlon make sure you also do strength training you can lose loads of weight doing endurance work but weight training develops the whole body
3173417 we can prevent decline in physical function later in life by pinpointing and dealing with problems now
3173418 compound moves such as squats deadlifts and bench presses done with medium to heavy weights are the key
3173419 free weights are better than machines as they improve functional strength and work the core and again proper instruction is important youre looking at four sets of each exercise of about six to 10 repeats so youre targeting your fast twitch muscle fibres muscle fibres used for intense sprint type movements as opposed to slow twitch fibres used for endurance exercise the more muscle mass you have the higher your metabolic rate and the more fat you burn when youre resting if you are new to weight training though start slowly you have to precondition your body
3173420 while we cant turn back the tide we can slow the rate of decrease a classic cause of disability in elderly people is falling because of loss of balance before we reach that stage if we can reduce the slowing down of the nervous system we can reduce the likelihood of falling when were older
3173421 try doing it with your eyes closed all the muscles twitch and at first you might panic then you start to improve
3173422 low impact exercise is best it is all about protecting the knees and hips
3173423 without wishing to sound depressing were not talking about building strength but decreasing the decline
3173424 its not about throwing the towel in its about being realistic
3173425 anything that can promote the idea of standing up balancing stretching and breathing bringing in all that coordination has got to be good
3173426 you can play them with a limited level of mobility get a really good cardiovascular workout and socialise
3173427 the balance and stability that the poles provide help to reduce the risk of falling regardless of the environment so it can mean the difference between going out and exercising and doing nothing at all
3173428 as you get older its more important than ever to get the right gear
3173429 as we age our thermoregulation isnt so good so it may be an idea to wear more layers of sports clothing when you exercise
3173430 and the more supple you are the better if your balance isnt great to start with do static stretching and if you can manage something more dynamic go for gentle yoga or pilates
3173431 the success of the model lies in being able to adapt what youre offering in the shortest time possible to what clients want
3173432 for inditex time is the principal factor to take into account more so than the costs of production
3173433 wealth is about so much more than pounds or euros or dollars can ever measure its time we admitted that theres more to life than money its time we focused not just on gdp but on gwb general well being
3173434 it would be nice if you would dispose of your litter
3173435 our goal is clear to move beyond a belief in the protestant work ethic alone to a modern vision of ethical work
3173436 we need to be so clear about every characters intention
3173437 now i feel the spotlight on my face i wonder how many stars to give to an empty space
3173438 id rather a tight nine minutes than a flaccid 15
3173439 theres so much in this part of me just wants to turn this into a brilliant whole show
3173440 i really want to spend five hours just focusing on this and getting it right
3173441 but ive got a wife and baby up here and ive got my own show to do
3173442 thank the lord for critics without them wed be screwed they watch the stupid shit we make so the shit wont get to you
3173443 i found the whole experience the chance to work so closely with my peers really creatively worthwhile
3173444 its the first time ive felt nervous in about four months
3173445 how difficult it is to be palestinian and how difficult it is for a palestinian to be a writer or a poet how can he achieve literary freedom in such slavish conditions and how can he preserve the literariness of literature in such brutal times
3173446 a land on the brink of dawn let us not quarrel about the number of those whove died here they lie together furnishing the grass for us that we should be reconciled
3173447 we like to say that that one person that we might have saved or extended their life they have at least ten people that care about them so you multiply that 300 by 10 and youre talking about a lot of lives affected
3173448 if we keep on whittling away at the edges and we lose our district then its just going to get smaller and smaller and maybe insignificant
3173449 were probably just going to wait and take case by case if we have others that might be what id call on the fringes of it
3173450 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili said

3173470 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3173471 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3173520 tom was very very nervous more than ever before and i think he really struggled to get through the competition
3173521 and for me to be his partner it was hard for me to get up there and ease him into his competition unfortunately its a partnership and you both have to be on top of your game i was on top of my game but tom was nowhere near the top of his game
3173522 i outdived tom and thats not normally something that happens its because tom had a lot more pressure on him than me
3173523 i knew we were capable of a medal but i knew going into this tournament it would depend on how tom performed
3173524 i dont see how tom let the side down at all he was bound to be nervous he is 14
3173525 neither of them dived their best but nobody made mistakes it sounds like sour grapes to me rather than taking it on the chin as he should
3173526 this was blakes only competition and the games are finished for him i just hope he doesnt upset tom because he has another competition to deal with in 11 days if he does he will have me to deal with
3173527 i was trying to calm him down but he had a pop at me before the last dive
3173528 when we were sitting down i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call but tom went to me what are you on the phone for
3173529 if i could do it again id make sure i had better form but it was great fun and i have the experience now
3173530 i am just going to keep doing the same things i would do in a normal competition but now i have got rid of my nerves to go into the individual

3173553 if you dont have the time boil the beans in water for 1 3 minutes turn off heat cover the pot and let them sit for one hour drain and proceed as per recipe however there is a problem with this quick soaking boiling for 1 3 minutes method hot water increases the solubility of the water soluble nutrients and softens the cell membranes of the beans further accelerating the loss of these nutrients this should be a consideration because of the long cooking time during which more nutrients are lost cold soaked and cooked at a very gentle simmer beans retain most of their nutrients which are considerable

3173561 were receiving a limited supply of almost all basic commodities which has been occasioned by drought and displacement following the post election chaos
3173562 the increased food prices are straining our financial expenditure as we can no longer afford some of the commodities
3173563 i used to plant nine acres of maize but now i will only have four acres of the crop just to take care of my family throughout the year
3173564 it doesnt help when a 50kg bag of fertiliser goes for sh3 900 up from sh1 600 last year and a litre of diesel at sh90 up from sh75 last year
3173565 in the face of food riots around the world like in africa and haiti we really have an emergency
3173566 the rise in prices of food commodities all over the world is not going to ease in the short term in view of supply demand situation
3173567 we have seen riots in egypt cameroon haiti and burkina faso
3173568 there is a risk that this unrest will spread in countries where 50 to 60 percent of income goes to food
3173569 i welcome economic growth in india and china but i also hope they will invest in agriculture because these two countries account for 2 2 billion people out of six billion
3173570 we need to pass that technology to developing countries and understand the processes to increase shelf life of basic foods
3173571 agro industry generates demand for agricultural products and holds vast potential for off farm rural employment
3173572 great stresses on the worlds ability to feed ever growing populations this challenge brings new threats to arable land areas livestock rearing and fisheries through droughts water shortages and pollution of land sea and air
3173573 we need to be concerned about the possibility of taking land or replacing arable land because of these biofuels
3173574 while i am very much conscious and aware of these problems at the same time you need to constantly look at having creative sources of energy including biofuels therefore at this time just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution i would urge we need to address these issues in a comprehensive manner
3173575 he doesnt know what is really going on in our agencies
3173576 at this time i wouldnt make any definitive judgment or definitive plans in particular vis vis these biofuels
3173577 i know there are some concerns raised by certain quarters about biofuels but biofuels are a renewable source of energy when we are experiencing extreme difficulties with resources

3173581 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3173582 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3173583 russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict

3173591 we reached a common determination that there is the need to take necessary steps
3173592 to increase transparency and restore confidence ministers and governors call on financial institutions to make full and immediate disclosure of on and off balance sheet risk exposures and losses
3173593 the use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy and when overall social benefits are assessed to exceed the cost of recapitalization at public expense
3173594 will achieve a significant shift in the representation of dynamic economies many of which are emerging market countries and give poorer countries a greater say in running the multilateral institution
3173595 it was music especially my passion for the violin that drew me to the issues surrounding the roma my trips to hungary and now the recent events in italy have left me profoundly perturbed by public attitudes to this community its fascinating that century after century gypsies are both the most romanticised people on earth and the most vilified this is almost as much the case now as it was two centuries ago writers of course have been milking the situation for donkeys years my second novel hungarian dances tells the story of a british born violinist karina whose discovery of hidden truths about her hungarian family history and her formidable grandmother mimis roma background challenges her own sense of identity

3173606 ha aceptado casi todas las propuestas de la uni n europea y de la osce con miras a resolver el conflicto con rusia

3173621 hay ciertamente un nivel de complicidad entre el isi agencia de inteligencia de pakist n y zonas militantes en pakist n as como organizaciones como los talibanes
3173622 no puedo decir hasta qu punto ejerce un liderazgo pero hay indicaciones de complicidad por parte del isi
3173623 est facilitando que estos grupos militantes salgan de las reas tribales de pakist n
3173624 desgraciadamente este a o constatamos un n mero m s elevado de no pashtunes de combatientes no afganos
3173625 proceden de una variedad de grupos tnicos algunos de reas de pakist n otros de zonas como uzbekist n chechenia europa y pa ses rabes

3173627 la guerra entre rusia y georgia ha creado una mayor incertidumbre en el mercado del petr leo siempre muy inestable
3173628 por ahora el abastecimiento no ha sido afectado porque los oleoductos y los pozos est n fuera del rea de conflicto
3173629 creo que si el conflicto es contenido al norte de georgia el suministro de crudo no se ver afectado pero los temores de que el conflicto puede ampliarse golpear el mercado del petr leo
3173630 es sobre todo la incertidumbre lo que est golpeando al mercado que teme que el conflicto entre rusia y georgia se convierta en una guerra
3173631 el mercado mira con preocupaci n cualquier se al de que puede haber una escalada del conflicto
3173632 y es que no ser a la primera vez que un peque o conflicto escala y se convierte en una guerra
3173633 la incertidumbre que est presionando los precios al alza durar hasta que est claro que las instalaciones petroleras en esa zona est n seguras
3173634 creo que la presi n sobre el precio del barril durar mientras persista la violencia entre rusia y georgia
3173635 cuando el conflicto sea resuelto el mercado volver a la normalidad

3173639 la agresi n de georgia deber a ser juzgada por un tribunal internacional
3173640 la responsabilidad deber a recaer sobre el presidente norteamericano george w bush
3173641 no se justifica la carest a de los alimentos ya que a los productores se les sigue pagando lo mismo y los intermediarios junto con empresarios son los responsables de que en algunas zonas del pa s el aumento de precios a la canasta b sica supere el ciento por ciento en lo que va de la actual administraci n
3173642 el cambio dijo fue decisi n presidencial pero se debe reconocer la falta de experiencia del sustituto y su relaci n con los empresarios cat licos

3173667 if a couple sees children as an imposition as something to be vaccinated against like an illness that betrays a deeply erroneous understanding of marriage and children
3173668 any director is automatically disqualified if convicted of one of a number of offences by a competent court anywhere in the world
3173669 if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature as always we will take advice from the home office and the foreign office
3173670 that there is a continuation of dictatorship in thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
3173671 los narcotraficantes al verse copados por los operativos federales principalmente por los del ej rcito mexicano han combinado dicha actividad con el secuestro

3173674 theres nothing at all wrong with your lovely shoulders it would be pointless immoral and greedy for me to start hacking or sucking away at them i would only be taking advantage of your low self esteem so just go home and learn to love your shoulders
3173675 this procedure is for people who are usually already in great shape and are very trim
3173676 a fascinating story of the harsh way in which a troubled community treats its eccentrics a partially sighted albino woman and her bird watching son are alienated as their mining village is destroyed weird but wonderful

3173679 and the next thing you know one day youre just going to go aaaarrrggghhh
3173680 it was almost like being a rookie again you have to learn a whole new system a whole different environment
3173681 especially the playbook the terminology was different pretend like they would say c and c meant to do no 1 but with the giants c meant no 2 see so i had to adjust to it and sometimes it would be wrong
3173682 when you think think think think think think think think it kind of impedes your natural abilities
3173683 am i doing the right thing you know so when youre flowing you cant be thinking about what youre doing the games being played
3173684 you had to write down some things to think about or some goals and stuff like that stay sane youve got to just try to be yourself and just somehow get away every chance you get
3173685 by and large he has had a very good training camp
3173686 they did a nice job putting a hat right on it and he was a little loose with the handling he will catch a lot more balls in that spot and we expect him to hold on to them first and foremost
3173687 he is making the big plays making the hard catches
3173688 i feel like its night and day from last year to this year
3173689 i think it will be a number of years before they start paying taxes again
3173690 look at those losses they can carry them forward for a number of years
3173691 i am worried about the states bond rating it could start to fall if the state doesnt do something about its budget problems
3173692 if they the state cut back were going to feel it no question about it
3173693 im not preaching gloom and doom our commitment is to maintain services in the city at a level where the public expects them to be
3173694 from birth ive always loved music but it was not until i attended high school at the age of thirteen that i thought about it as something i could do myself
3173695 at that time i followed bounty killers style but then my friend warrior mark him said you have the potential you have the talent from there i started increasing my own thing and with encouragement from my peers and inspiration and ting the music started to flow
3173696 guys were flying around and there was some good physical contact i liked the attitude
3173697 were still not where we need to be on either side of the ball the offense is kind of hit and miss right now we need to pick up the tempo and block a little better and get a little more consistency in what were doing on offense were rotating a lot of people in there and that doesnt help the situation but theres no excuse not to be more consistent
3173698 we made two or three up and down depth chart moves today based on what weve seen earlier and well probably be doing that for the next week to try and ascertain what our best lineup is and get more cohesion with it
3173699 we always thought of him as an offensive lineman when we recruited him but we never want to miss the boat we wanted to talke a look at both smith and chandler burden over on the defensive side and see if they would flash at us and show us something chandler did but matt didnt look like a defensive explosion player we decided to move him over to the other side and now he looks like one of the more athletic players well have in the offensive line thats where weve gotten better in the last two or three years in the offensive line getting more athletic ability in those positions
3173700 but thats good because thats one of the things that youre going to see every single week in this league
3173701 those guys are running and flying around to the football theyre having fun over there and i like seeing that its only making us better were young and inexperienced and right now theyre bloodying our nose but thats a good thing
3173702 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3173703 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between and distant observations of impacts on species
3173704 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3173705 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3173706 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3173707 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3173708 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3173709 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3173710 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3173711 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3173712 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3173713 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3173714 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision

3173719 ive lost one of my best buddies and it is not easy to reckon with
3173720 personally my buddy will be missed for many reasons by me
3173721 adjusting and constantly evolving expanding and trying to stay as young as i can
3173722 could use a little more substance like we had in the day
3173723 theyre standing on our shoulders some of them dont realize it because they sample me so much
3173724 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing
3173725 toward the opening i started having trepidations oh my god what have i done ive ruined my career but when it aired the ratings went through the roof
3173726 i went back on speaking engagements and encouraged african americans to go to africa to interact socially culturally and or economically
3173727 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3173728 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3173729 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3173730 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3173731 hes almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did
3173732 bicampe o mundial era apontado por toda a gente como favorito e eu n o ganhei apenas derly foi humilhado no tapete humilhado por mim
3173733 tinha contas a ajustar com ele j fomos grandes amigos agora somos apenas conhecidos aqui s o cumprimentei em respeito ao jud brasileiro uma vez em s o paulo fui s compras com a m e dele e mais tarde vim a saber que enquanto isso ele estava com a minha namorada me traiu
3173734 pois o derly gosta de passar a imagem de atleta de cristo mas depois
3173735 prometi que faria aquele gesto depois de ganhar do derly est a ver como eu sempre acreditei tanto
3173736 they promised not to be mean and i had to trust them
3173737 oh my god please tell me this is not happening
3173738 i take what i do very seriously and i think there is a lesson to be learned in every segment but contrary to popular opinion i do have a sense of humor
3173739 i think that 20 somethings and 30 somethings will watch this show and laugh along but still come away learning something
3173740 its interesting to look back eight years and see what was important
3173741 its a different world now we just dont make felt hats the way we used to
3173742 in one episode martha is showing people how to properly whittle a twig to roast a marshmallow
3173743 that is screamingly funny the woman is actually whittling a twig i mean who does that
3173744 it didnt feel right to be honest on that show which is why i didnt say anything
3173745 why would we lie about the three of us having one 4 man raft
3173746 the first premise of this book is that what most business leaders think is their greatest challenge really isnt
3173747 in most of my 20 year tenure as ceo of solomon software i was in react mode moving from one crisis to the next
3173748 but most organizations dont have the framework the will or the persistence to make the hard choices it requires
3173749 sustainable excellence isnt possible unless an organization learns to systemically increase its capability to execute and to do so faster than the rate at which its challenges are growing its ironic that the better an organization executes today the bigger its challenges will be tomorrow
3173750 remember bad culture eats good strategy for lunch and after lunch you still have a bad culture
3173751 one thing bout music when it hit you feel no pain
3173752 its been a long time i shouldnt have left you without a strong rhyme to step to think of how many weak shows you slept through

3173757 russia didnt beat the georgian army it defeated the us army
3173758 obama tried to make us lose in iraq to further his own ambitions
3173759 we still hear that one of the most striking demonstrations of virtually unanimous opposition is the address of rejection of the union which poured into the scottish parliament from every corner of scotland
3173760 that about 1770 lord stormont was at vienna sir andrew mitchell at berlin lord cathcart at st petersburg sir robert m keith was at warsaw and sir william hamilton was at naples
3173761 knox was less puritanical than contemporary popes were people will not believe you the shutters visibly go up
3173762 the general assembly of the church of scotland has met at this time in a state of peace and security exceeding our greatest hopes is under god owing to his majestys wisdom and good ness in sending your royal highness and to your generous resolution in coming to be the deliverer of this church and nation
3173763 lets hear less about the 5000 or so highlanders who were at culloden on 16 of april 1746 and more about the quarter of a million or so highlanders who were no where near culloden some of them at home industriously weaving linen
3173764 this is not about talking about peace this is about creating real peace
3173765 the u s military instructors directly command and coordinate actions of mercenaries without being involved in actual fighting the source specified according to intelligence data there are roughly 1 000 military instructors of the united states in georgia
3173766 task force of russia has annihilated a few groups of mercenaries some of mercenaries have been captured and investigators are working with them the source said
3173767 we have detained 10 agents of the georgian special services who were spying on military facilities and preparing terrorist attacks including on russian territory
3173768 we are trying to stop this as soon as possible
3173769 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3173770 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3173771 at the moment our troops are pushing out capturing and disarming groups of georgian law enforcement agencies which have been surrounded in the capital of south ossetia
3173772 the 1992 treaty which georgia signed among others clearly defines the limits of responsibility of the russian peacekeeping contingent and is doesnt have any tasks of invading the georgian territory
3173773 inflicted damage on operational systems troops and military facilities of georgia
3173774 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia targeting civilian populations in cities and villages as well as radio and telecommunications sites
3173775 during their mop up operations in south ossetia georgian commandos have thrown hand grenades into the basements where civilians were hiding
3173776 im very grateful for the excellent medical care ive received i especially appreciate that world fed have decided to discontinue their investigation into my company and myself i look forward to resuming a productive and quiet life although hopefully a little less quiet than recently
3173777 why would they joel if they had forcibly induced him into a coma why would they let him live they would know a man like him would be trouble when he woke if i were them when it all blew over i would have given him something that made it look like a natural death not so dear catherine joel had thought long and hard about the world fed strategy in this matter world fed thought ten moves ahead and joels brain had to follow them down every possible path it proves they didnt do it that they have nothing to hide
3173778 so because its a completely stupid decision to wake him up thats exactly what they did
3173779 now you have it cath obvious when you think it through theyre brazen
3173780 and what pray tell do they do when mcguire starts screaming on the stream that world fed had put him in a coma for no reason except to keep him quiet
3173781 thats the beauty of it they have this plausible deniability mcguire is no medical expert and besides how much weight can you give to someone whos been in a coma for two years
3173782 and what about the doctors the paramedics the security officers the hospital staff the effing media they must have all been in on it how elaborate you know joel i think i might just have gone with the plug option
3173783 well world fed is extremely well resourced and anyway youd probably only need to have the head doctor in on it nobody would question what the head doctor did after a moment or two and now that i think of it i bet the head doctor is appointed by some world fed lackey
3173784 well its been great that youve given this one its first outing joel its finding the first few hurdles a bit difficult though isnt it next time you should race it on the flat for the last two years joel youve been ranting on about how mcguire was as good as dead how hed never see the sun again now hey presto hes off to the beach and your implying theyve tampered with his sunscreen oh jesus ive married my fucking father
3173785 i will lets see its a matter of finding the key number and seeing if theres a pattern
3173786 now they dont influence it but sometimes a race can be excluded from the system because of the form you know especially in really big races
3173787 hold on i didnt consider the non runners it all turns on the non runners
3173788 cant stay luke cant stay i have no ears today but god bless you luke
3173789 this committee as envisioned was to provide parliamentary and independent advice to the prime minister
3173790 if its cabinet people on it the suspicion has to be that theyre not there providing independent advice theyre just there as mouthpieces for the prime ministers office
3173791 we have to respect the separation between judicial power and the government
3173792 i hope the government will realize they made a terrible mistake
3173793 ultimately the appointment of a supreme court justice is a function of the executive
3173794 weve put this process in place and we have the right to name some individuals were not providing a veto to the bloc or the ndp on these things
3173795 to follow the example of world trade center bomber ramzi youssef and bring the lightning to america
3173796 some of the more sensational threat reporting such as that bin laden wanted to hijack a u s aircraft
3173797 desliga essa c mera n o gosto n o funciono com c mera
3173798 need to show that there will be a political cost for this action in terms of the relationship of the russian federation with its western partners
3173799 either we find a way to respond to russias military action together or we have to live with the decision that we will face a different world tomorrow
3173800 the invading army of the russian federation has entered georgian territory outside the conflict zones of abkhazia and south ossetia
3173801 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia and the further loss of life
3173802 we do not have and have never had any plans to advance on tbilisi
3173803 so far we have got from them moral support and humanitarian aid but we need more than that to stop this barbaric aggression
3173804 youve met a man you dont understand some men just want to watch the world burn
3173805 what i would have to become to stop men like him
3173806 things were always going to get worse before they got better
3173807 perhaps both bruce and mr dent believed that batman stands for something more potent than the whims of a terrorist
3173808 even if everyone hates him for it thats a sacrifice hes making
3173809 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
3173810 for many years sports professionals have realised the benefits of exploiting technology to improve techniques the ecb in particular has recognised the valuable part cctv can play in a fast paced sport such as cricket and we are naturally very pleased to be working in partnership with sanyo to provide the academy with an invaluable training tool
3173811 in recent years theres been a blurring of the lines between work and home and we need to recognize these shifting patterns of behaviour to meet our employees expectations we aim to be as flexible as possible as a company and part of this involves moving from a paternalistic to a more trusting policy when it comes to employee use of the web at work at the same time we have a duty of care towards our employees and must ensure that we secure our network and can block sites which are tasteless or offensive
3173812 before using blue coat we had a more blunt instrument of the block all allow all approach which didnt take into consideration the needs of different departments or regions likewise our av solution simply didnt have the capability to scan everything with blue coat we can now apply more finely tuned levels of policy across multiple web security services
3173813 we have to reflect this variety by applying flexibility in our policy controls and we can now fine tune our policies to meet these requirements
3173814 switching over to the blue coat appliances involved installing the new devices into our complex network environment this was facilitated by blue coats flexible architecture that allowed us to overcome many integration challenges
3173815 these features will also prove invaluable as we make increased use of web based applications and other tools such as video streaming without impacting on overall network performance
3173816 the system really works we can claim a 100 success rate since installation there have been no repeat incidents of vandalism or cable theft
3173817 this gives brokers a jump on the attackers and raises the bar
3173818 investors need to be extra careful when they are investing in this kind of company because they can lose all of their money and these stocks are particularly vulnerable to manipulation more than ever because of the internet
3173819 decrease the time between the attack being launched and the brokerage being able to respond
3173820 what this self learning behavioural engine does is look at the different attributes of the event not necessarily about the computer or where you are logging on from but about the actual transaction the trade the amount of the trade
3173821 for example have you liquidated all of your assets in stock that you own in order to buy one penny stock
3173822 another example is when a customer who normally trades tech stock on nasdaq all of a sudden trades a penny stock that has to do with health care and is placing a trade four times more than normal
3173823 the fraudster may buy that one stock in multiple small chunks to stay under the radar but we can pick that up and send an alert on that
3173824 more subtly it will detect and question if say five people at the same brokerage are trading this one penny stock in a short period of time and that stock has shown a spike in volatility
3173825 people are somewhat shy on reporting losses because it erodes investor confidence
3173826 pump and dump increases the cost of doing business in terms of the loss in the marketplace
3173827 verisign has taken a proven concept in counter fraud control activity from what they have been successful in doing in the online banking environment and that is to gauge the risk of a specific account activity on the fly and score the risk when they see something that departs from the norm
3173828 als de blessure ernstiger is geworden zal er het laatste woord nog niet over zijn gezegd
3173829 roy heeft me verteld dat er geen reactie is in zijn voet

3173833 the whole conflict is not being waged over the pipeline the reasons are definitely geopolitical
3173834 however the russians know the pipeline is important to georgia and may try to damage it they have the capability to do so
3173835 this shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets
3173836 for europeans an alternative supply route is psychological reassurance its having a route that does not go through russia
3173837 but the other countries the pipeline passes through may ultimately prove more unreliable
3173838 and please make your position and speak with one united voice
3173839 i like your articles but the independent had a footnote the other day saying that stalin divided north and south ossetia its not true south ossetia has always been georgian
3173840 it is clear what is happening we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war
3173841 all the russian troops who arrived by ship have crossed over to zugdidi
3173842 the city is deserted but there are no russians here
3173843 its not south ossetia only but the whole of georgia
3173844 we heard statements saying that the russian railroad troops that entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there for a humanitarian mission now we know the truth that these forces were there to rebuild the railway to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a russian invasion
3173845 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3173846 one payment must be made to save on shipping with multiple items

3173852 russell would not have wanted this to be a sad or over solemn occasion yet we are all left still with a sense of shock at his sudden departure
3173853 he was a man of values principles and ethics who made a great contribution to the advancement of civil liberties and human rights
3173854 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3173855 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3173856 the only language that bullies understand is when someone stands up to them
3173857 this is not an occasion for megaphone diplomacy russias behaviour is disproportionate and unacceptable but the only way to bring stability back to the region is through diplomatic means
3173858 the first minister took the opportunity to have a private meeting with the russian ambassador to make that clear
3173859 the ambassador pledged to communicate that message to the russian government
3173860 russia is trying to send the strongest signal it can that it will not countenance further meddling as it sees it in its affairs
3173861 this is one of the only growing oil markets in the world and it is such a dangerous cocktail mix of politics economics and strategic interests that frankly the health and wellbeing of the civilians of south ossetia is nothing to do with it
3173862 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3173863 we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe this war has pushed georgia further away from europe
3173864 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate

3173868 it is simply na ve to believe this kind of shortfall will not impact on front line policing or recruitment strathclyde faces a deeply damaging and immediate threat to essential recruitment plans
3173869 unless the scottish government accepts immediate responsibility for this shortfall strathclyde has no choice but to consider cash saving options from budgets which have already been slashed
3173870 the last thing we want is a freeze on police recruitment unfortunately the impact of this financial crisis means it must be considered
3173871 the subject of ongoing correspondence between the scottish government and the uk government and were discussed at the 31 july meeting between ministers cosla the local authorities body acpos the police chiefs association and the police conveners forum

3173878 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3173879 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3173880 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3173881 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3173882 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

3173895 the participants demonstrated a perception that not having to attach receipts to the return creates a temptation for electronic filers to overstate their claims for deductions and credits
3173896 they believed they would not be caught as long as the overstatements were relatively small
3173897 software users do demonstrate a significantly higher non compliance rate as compared to non software users
3173898 we are all about to make the beast with two backs
3173899 from the beginning of othello more shakespeare ill let you figure out what a beast with two backs is
3173900 use the bathroom and get ready i suspect they will use you for quite a while
3173901 i dont know her name but she has been here longer than me shes not too bright she has a reputation for ignoring whipping up to the point it cuts her they may want her in the movie for that
3173902 she cant stand the tanks so they put her in the tanks
3173903 im horny i hope they fuck me a dozen times
3173904 yes thats from hamlets soliloquy of course hes wishing to be dead not fucked i like the additional meaning of consummation in this context
3173905 i didnt expect a lot of cooperation from slaves in the prison
3173906 you might not get it from some of the slaves but i want to be treated well and the best way to get that is to be pleasant on top of that being in the movie is more exciting than the dull prison routine and im looking forward to having sex
3173907 i wonder how the viewing public will like this sex scene
3173908 no just being watched by the guys in the control room
3173909 shall we skip the preliminaries and go right to the main event
3173910 youre the director im just the slave girl please fuck me would you like me to put the condom on you
3173911 yes please i wonder how to get dispensation from that requirement
3173912 you are very very good at that did you take lessons
3173913 you should develop a reading list for women the male population would be in your debt
3173914 i can be after a phone call and the arrival of a new trusty was the other slave unsatisfactory
3173915 like fucking a dead fish shes gorgeous but just lies there
3173916 if you are sending her out id like to try an experiment
3173917 is her collar set to shock her if she leaves the room
3173918 id like you to leave it that way when she leaves i was going to have you shock one of the other slaves but if shes a lousy fuck we might as well shock her
3173919 of course sir ill notify the control desk they like to know about demonstrations and punishments a lot of out of bounds shocks are simple mistakes and often not on the part of the slave wearing the collar so we limit shocks as long as they are within the secure area of the prison but we limit them a bit more for known situations i need to cuff her before i send her out the door and she knows that she may collapse when shes shocked so we will want a guard out there waiting we try to avoid damaging slaves other than in ways specified by their owners ill arrange it all
3173920 sir they are sending another trusty and a pick up guard it will just be a minute or two
3173921 theres a guard out there to take you to punishment go out to him
3173922 ok now good in the tanks you go for being a lousy fuck
3173923 i got permission from my owner this is cunt 3856 she will be the trusty in charge now
3173924 inside the prison my name is cunt 3905 and nothing else outside there are different rules
3173925 how long will she be in the tank id like to see it
3173926 about four hours we can give you hundreds of hours of video of it and we have a greatest hits dvd of interesting things
3173927 doing that was a real good start how are you at sucking
3173928 i dont have a rating from a professional but those with some experience have told me that i may be a 7 or even an 8
3173929 that makes me horny again you do it to me
3173930 up here on the bed legs spread i hope you are wet
3173931 you are tight your orgasm is strong and enjoyable for me
3173932 we can definitely use you in the movie if your owner approves i hope he does
3173933 can i keep andi here for a little bit id like to talk with her
3173934 to give the rest of us a tour of some of the prison i think well take the other two slaves with us
3173935 what do you want me for youve shot your wad
3173936 i know that i enslaved you and humiliated you and that you havent forgiven me for that if it hadnt been for the public insults we traded i might not have done the humiliation i would have enslaved you though because i wanted you so bad and you were limiting me so much i figured that you would drop me if i bought a sex slave to supplement the sex i know that your career was damaged by the choice of movies and that this is a long shot to improve it i promise to listen to you in the future when this movie is finished we can live like a couple no public slave stuff no being passed around i hope that you will come to enjoy being with me again
3173937 eddie you are right im still mad at you saying that we can live like a regular couple though helps a lot ill probably get over some of the anger as time passes
3173938 that speech was out of character for you are you settling down some
3173939 maybe i missed you these last few months i still have to play the raunchy rock star but i am getting older and a little calmer
3173940 why do they call this place iron rod it has a certain character to it an implied threat but there must be something more is it a phallic reference
3173941 i think its from the bible psalms 2 9 you shall break them with an iron rod and dash them in pieces like a potters vessel its a twisting of the chapter but they like to twist things here there are references to iron rods in samuel job and revelation too
3173942 you seem to be a shakespearean scholar and a biblical scholar as well thats rare
3173943 especially in a slave prison you mean i was studying literature which includes shakespeare a lot of literature makes heavy references to the bible so a serious literature student also studies the bible
3173944 i didnt look too deeply into the records how did you end up as a slave in a prison
3173945 so im here for a year being tortured for an offense that a gets a man a fine and a suspended license
3173946 linda is here being tortured for displeasing her husband its better than the meat dealers isnt it
3173947 ive been thinking about that at least the meat dealers would make an end and get it over with
3173948 no at least not usually its just something that crosses my mind occasionally the one nice thing about being here is that i get fucked a lot more than i did before thank you for the nice fuck
3173949 is she really as stupid as she seems to be
3173950 yes she is he husband was hoping that it was an act but it doesnt appear to be hes not sure whether to take her back as an occasional fuck slave or just sell her off shes not much in the sack nothing seems to get through to her
3173951 you would have to take that up with her owner the prison management can get you in touch with him
3173952 ill have them do that id like you to put someone in the tank while i watch id like to get an idea of the visuals
3173953 there is a slave coming down here shortly for punishment
3173954 are there any prisoners that like being in the tank
3173955 ive heard that there are one or two i figured they just needed a little less air or a little higher voltage hey cunt 3967 are there any idiots that actually like going in the tank
3173956 yes there are two of them we tried making it harder on them but they liked it anyway they dont get the tanks much any more
3173957 ill have them added to your interview schedule cunt 3967 is a good story too shes a prisoner and her owner likes to have her put in the tanks she was here so much that when her owner allowed her to be a trusty they made her a tank room attendant
3173958 it gets hard on the skin its usually four hours in the tank every other day
3173959 do they give you all of the punishments these two are getting
3173960 yes and i have to get myself ready to go into the tank on top of it
3173961 sometimes a girl needs a little encouragement that was a much more severe cunt shock than the random ones
3173962 i press this other button and a shock prod pushes out into the tank and starts a continuous zap until she complies any prisoner that does it more than once is chained down with a belt so she cant get off the dildo and the dildo is continually electrified at a low level
3173963 ill look into this more tomorrow id like to see the gallows and the electric punishment room
3173964 has anyone else come by after you were left here
3173965 oh ick they will make you clean that up and it wont be pleasant have a nice time in the noose dear and remember sometimes it only works on the second or third pull
3173966 most do when we get a bunch of new prisoners at a time we sometimes need a week to get them all good and scared
3173967 i want to put that in the movie as a short transition it will remove the surprise though for new prisoners
3173968 it might reduce it but when you are in that noose and on the trap door with your hands cuffed behind you any pull on that lever is scary
3173969 we have to be careful on the torso so we dont affect the heart that is unless the desired effect is electrocution
3173970 that can also be used for pain and torture not just for death it is very effective with some slaves
3173971 as you can see we can zap just pussy or ass or we can zap both at once megan mount up on the double dildo board you too linda
3173972 yes for a longer time more than once its my husbands favorite punishment for me he thinks it tightens up the cunt muscles
3173973 that was hot well put that in the movie too in fact i think you two will be the ones on it in the movie i hope a repeat will be as hot as this time maybe well even put andi on it at the same time maybe you too cunt 3905
3173974 what else that an audience would consider hot would you suggest i see
3173975 maybe the ponygirl working parties we cant take these two out there unless they are on ponygirl detail
3173976 they pull carts full of stuff like food coming into the prison trash going out bodies going out whatever
3173977 so its real work not just running back and forth
3173978 ill have to look into that id like to talk to other prisoners especially some that have different reasons for being in here
3173979 cunt 4567 is cunt 4566s mother she came in the same day as cunt 4566 but for different reasons shes not movie star material but you might find her story interesting
3173980 fine lets go see her while we are going there cunt 4566 can explain
3173981 my mother had been getting fat being bitchy and refusing my father marital relations when i was to be sent here she got to be unbearable after i was taken inside the prison a slaver came into the lobby and completed the enslavement of my mother and the prison took her i didnt know about it for over a week she was going to get some liposuction and skin reduction surgery but i havent seen her in weeks my father said he would take her back when she was slimmer and had learned to obey and not bitch
3173982 yes thats why she is interesting young attractive wives are sent here for readjustment old fat bitches usually arent her husband must love her to spend the money on her
3173983 this is linda this is cunt 3905 this is the director of the movie that they are going to make here in the prison and that i will be in he wanted to speak to some other prisoners and we thought of you
3173984 youre going to be in a movie thats great what kinds of costumes will you get to wear
3173985 im wearing it its about prisoners in the prison it has a big star too it may be a big deal anyway ill get some screen exposure and a little less boring existence while it is being filmed
3173986 you will be in a big movie naked thats terrible
3173987 not at all even the big stars are naked more often than not any more
3173988 tell me your story about how you ended up in here
3173989 my husband was sick of me and stuck me in here to be tortured when my daughter was put in here they starve me and make me walk on that treadmill for hours
3173990 on top of that im naked all the time thats not civilized
3173991 im naked starved had my skin trimmed and forced to walk on treadmills
3173992 ive been whipped stuck on electrified dildos stuck underwater in tanks with air cutoffs and shocks put in very small cages and left there for hours and chained for hours at a time
3173993 doesnt that sound a lot worse than what youve been through
3173994 well youll be here for a while to work it all out
3173995 thanks for bringing me to see her lets go back to the tank room to see how they are doing
3173996 i dont think its going to be happy happy house for everybody maybe it will but im not so sure
3173997 there are too many competitive game players here big brother and we are about to meet them
3173998 like i really believe white hair dude would know how to use that red hot phone the antique one in the oval oriface and like invite that putin dude the k beegee guy to come over here and see what soviet aggression
3173999 but every choice they made in that movie was wrong
3174000 the idea was to make an american christ figure but what they centered on was his weakness
3174001 they made him more a lamb of god rather than give us a real powerful superman they had too many scenes where hes being kicked to the floor and thats not superman superman would get up and fight
3174002 the hulk has proven the audience will forgive you and let you redo the franchise
3174003 superman is a character more recognizable than abraham lincoln or mickey mouse
3174004 but no one knows crap about mickey mouse hes a symbol understanding a soul is much harder so dont treat him like a walking american flag
3174005 men of tomorrow geeks gangsters and the birth of the comic book
3174006 superman was created not because america is the greatest country on earth not because moses came to save us from krypton but because a little boy lost his father
3174007 in his first appearances he couldnt fly he didnt have x ray vision he was only bulletproof so supermans not a character built out of strength but out of loss
3174008 when you hear that it puts on a whole new spin on superman and his origins
3174009 the understanding was that batman was born out of traged and superman out of hope and aspiration and it turns out that its about not wanting to lose your loved ones thats critical and it means that we can connect with him hes not an untouchable character bad things still happen to him his father passes away and his powers cant save him
3174010 everybody knows what its like to see the pretty girl and think if only she could see me for who i really was
3174011 past the glasses and acne or whatever but he has to hide and half his co workers dont even know his name thats a critical part too
3174012 it is so much deeper than hes an alien with superpowers
3174013 i never wanted to write a superman movie before but i do now i understand what superman is now
3174014 kami dirugikan karena seharusnya jadwal kami di luwuk hanya sampai minggu di jakarta banyak pekerjaan di sini biaya hotel dan lainnya membengkak padahal tidak ada kejelasan tentang kompensasi dari merpati apakah menanggung hotel dan makan selama kami menunggu

3174033 no major deterioration in credit quality although banks would lift the collective amount of money set aside for bad debts they cited federal insolvency data showing the proportion of companies in financial distress was somewhat level at 0 11 per cent
3174034 this data is consistent with recent commentary from the banks which suggests that while they are expecting further increases in losses this has not been evidenced to date they wrote

3174046 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3174047 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3174048 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3174049 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3174050 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3174051 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3174052 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3174053 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3174054 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3174055 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3174056 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3174057 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3174058 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3174059 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3174060 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3174061 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3174062 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3174063 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3174064 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3174065 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3174066 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3174067 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3174068 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3174069 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3174070 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3174071 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3174072 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3174073 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3174074 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3174075 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3174076 o presidente pode dar pux o de orelha em qualquer ministro da sua compet ncia mas eu n o levei pux o de orelha

3174078 n o me arrependo de emitir essa opini o porque defendi apenas um conceito de que tortura n o crime pol tico a respeito de uma quest o que est presente na sociedade e regulada por tratados internacionais e n o recebi nenhuma advert ncia do presidente em rela o a isso
3174079 na o que n o se permite debater de tortura ou n o crime pol tico n o merece o r tulo democr tico
3174080 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3174081 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3174082 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3174083 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3174084 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3174085 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3174086 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3174087 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3174088 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3174089 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3174090 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3174091 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3174092 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3174093 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3174100 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3174101 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3174102 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3174103 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3174104 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3174105 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3174106 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3174107 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3174108 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3174109 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3174110 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3174111 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3174112 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3174113 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3174114 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3174115 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3174116 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3174117 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3174118 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3174119 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3174120 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3174121 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3174122 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3174123 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3174124 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3174125 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3174126 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3174127 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3174128 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3174129 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3174130 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3174131 who are open to doing something on the production side
3174132 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3174133 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3174134 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3174135 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3174136 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3174137 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3174138 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3174139 apesar da grande expectativa n o h nenhuma novidade maravilhosa porque estamos seguindo o que a lei determina e o decreto n o pode mudar a lei 8630 93

3174146 okay i had a friend who came here a few years ago she has a stomach problem and she is in america right now but she wanted me to bring back medicine it was the only medicine that works to stop diarrhea
3174147 put small piles of cornmeal where you see ants they eat it take it home cant digest it so it kills them it may take a week or so especially if it rains but it works and it doesnt harm animals
3174148 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3174149 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3174150 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3174151 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3174152 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3174153 con este apret n de manos nos extendemos unos a otros como ciudadanos del mundo entero en el esp ritu ol mpico de la amistad y la excelencia comprometi ndonos a exigir a todos nuestros gobiernos a alcanzar un nivel m s elevado de paz justicia y respeto por la dignidad humana en cualquier lugar en que estos principios est n en falta sea en tibet irak birmania o dondequiera el di logo es la mejor forma de salir adelante para china y el mundo

3174156 democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude
3174157 in direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between americal soldiers and the vietnamese people are excellent
3174158 i mean i was in a unit that was responsible for my lai i got there after my lai happened so in war these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again but they are still to be deplored
3174159 milk is just as much as gas prices these days
3174160 this is hard to have your kids watch their parents go through this
3174161 we have to put up with a lot of humiliation on just to survive
3174162 its not dignified but we are hungry and hunger is ugly
3174163 since there is no direct flight from origin to destination and you have to fly to a transit point which falls in another region the award would be x x x x i e 4x
3174164 not only that the award for x miles would also be invalid because it was almost four times the award limit for max miles flown
3174165 well if you had told me this on my first call i would have never bothered but it seems that different agents at reward desk have different interpretation of rules

3174167 and comes to question what i have been doing all along over the last few months with some additional extended commentary that i thought i would share my two cents on top of to keep adding further up into the conversation thus here we go
3174168 but i am left waiting for the other shoe to drop whats the skinny luis you did it but what was it like qualitatively
3174169 if he had 212 emails per day before how many additional phone calls ims and social app messages did he create receive is it only sustainable for a few weeks whats the deep narrative it feels like a dog walking its not that the dog walks so well but that he can do it at all
3174170 what happens luis if everyone does it how will companies react if people expect you to respond to email and you arent there what should their expectation be
3174171 my son can now eat speak watch a movie without falling asleep
3174172 he can drink from a cup he can express pain he can cry and he can laugh
3174173 students would be encouraged to broaden their science education but would not be forced to do so
3174174 the choice to opt out and take double science would remain
3174175 reflect the importance of these skills to the uk economy
3174176 young people are missing out they are doing better than ever in science tests at 14 but hardly any are going on to study triple science gcse despite the opportunities and learning it offers
3174177 we need to create an environment in schools that reflects the importance of science and the value of studying it
3174178 we also need to send an unambiguous message to young people who are good at science that science as a career can be fascinating and worthwhile and will reward you well
3174179 the question is whether our fellow citizens will do more than just pour concrete
3174180 we also announced today the new group of experts who will help us to develop the science diploma which will help prepare students for both further study and a scientific career
3174181 a universe with a god would look quite different from a universe without one a physics a biology where there is a god is bound to look different
3174182 certainly i see the scientific view of the world as incompatible with religion but that is not what is interesting about it it is also incompatible with magic but that also is not worth stressing what is interesting about the scientific world view is that it is true inspiring remarkable and that it unites a whole lot of phenomena under a single heading
3174183 what can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof
3174184 its been suggested that if the supernaturalists really had the powers they claim theyd win the lottery every week i prefer to point out that they could also win a nobel prize for discovering fundamental physical forces hitherto unknown to science
3174185 i like miley she seems to have a sweet character
3174186 anyone we like or respect no matter how different they may be we would play with

3174190 our brain seems to remember the injury as if it were fresh and cant forget it
3174191 in some ways you can think of chronic pain as the inability to turn off the memory of the pain whats exciting is that we now may be relieving what has clinically been the most difficult to treat the suffering or the emotional component of pain
3174192 override the wishes of a concussed player or medical personnel
3174193 why how and for how long ptsd symptoms will present evolve and maintain
3174194 the nature and incidence of psychiatric and emotional problems in adults suffering traumatic brain injury was recently illuminated in a study reporting a thirty year follow up of brain injured individuals as has been reported in short term studies of emotional dysfunction following traumatic brain injury this study demonstrates that a significant number of individuals struggle long term with psychiatric disorders following traumatic brain injury forty eight percent of these individuals experienced an axis i disorder that began after the traumatic brain injury sixty two percent had an axis i disorder anytime during their lives the most common disorders after traumatic brain injury were major depression 27 alcohol abuse or dependence 12 panic disorder 8 specific phobia 8 and psychosis 7 fourteen subjects or 23 had at least one personality disorder the most prevalent individual personality disorders were avoidant 15 paranoid 8 and schizoid 7 interested readers are referred directly to the article by koponen and colleagues american journal of psychiatry august 2002 volume 159 pages 1315 1321 causes decades lasting vulnerability to psychiatric illness in many individuals in these individuals appropriate care and treatment of emotional and behavioral problems may well speak to the difference between poor or adverse outcome clearly additional research is needed to determine to what extent these adverse outcomes can be mitigated by early identification and appropriate diagnosis as well as psychosocial and medical intervention on a long term supportive basis further studies are also needed specifically of individuals with mild traumatic brain injury in clinical settings it often appears that the long term adverse emotional and psychiatric problems these individuals experience may also be related to difficulty with chronic pain and stress these data highlight the importance of emotional behavioral and psychiatric assessment as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery it is my experience that for many individuals recovering from traumatic brain injury long term prognosis and functioning is often better predicted by emotional regulation and psychiatric stability than eventual level of cognitive and neuropsychological function
3174195 much of the medical care for wounded iraq vets remains a national shame the mental problems caused by either brain injury or post traumatic stress will be a legacy of this war for decades
3174196 the brain which gets shaken like jelly is frequently damaged
3174197 is defined as a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the function of the brain
3174198 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
3174199 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with bernies wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3174200 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the pre eminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3174201 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honoured to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3174202 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3174203 however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
3174204 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
3174205 recent research has shown that diagnosing mild tbis as soon as possible is critically important because without proper management recovery can take longer and people who are still recovering are at higher risk of having a second more serious injury we believe that the ace assessment tool will provide a needed diagnostic tool for physicians because it provides the most up to date information on how to recognize and treat concussion
3174206 neuroplasticity is defined as the capacity of brain cells to fight the chemical and structural changes that occur following trauma that can eventually kill them if not controlled neuroplasticity also refers to the ability of brain cells to modify their activity in response to change in the environment to store information from the environment and to permit the organism to move about and survive thus all functioning brains to some extent operate under the principle of neuroplasticity throughout life
3174207 neuro rehabilitative therapy in particular cognitive rehabilitation may well facilitate the brains plasticity this theory has been demonstrated not only from the patients perspective and observations of others but even through spect and pet scanning it also appears that neuro re organization can be enhanced through specific training though compensatory strategies can be helpful post brain injury plasticity research suggests that the appropriate timing of teaching these strategies is a critical and complex issue if strategies are implemented too early those potentially available compensatory parts of the brain may not be capable of effectively taking over function this may explain the significant problems many mild to low moderate brain injured patients experience when they return often within a few days post injury to every day activities particularly work thus too much activity too early post injury may lead to increased adverse outcome
3174208 one can argue that atvs are even more difficult to drive than a car

3174213 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3174214 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3174215 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3174216 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3174217 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3174218 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3174219 it looks like we have reached some kind of stalemate

3174230 there was a bomb this morning just outside the city centre so i thought time was up
3174231 tbilisi is a vibrant exciting happy city it has clearly changed it has undergone a metamorphosis in the past eight years economically and socially but in the past five to six days it has turned into a ghost town
3174232 people have been conscripted or have decided to move out to the villages where they think there is less of a threat of being bombed
3174233 i must apologise again for deciding to come to live in england if i am fortunate enough i will return and die on thai soil just like other thais

3174243 we felt that limiting the survey to just one group wasnt going to give us the whole picture
3174244 these results showed us that enterprise risk management has become a huge challenge for those charged with managing a companys financial health with many looking for guidance on the next steps they should take
3174245 the common theme in the two surveys suggests the need for more collaboration between finance audit committees and caes
3174246 there are still many challenges on the enterprise risk management journey including making the link between audit committees caes and cfos stronger

3174286 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

3174382 gt humans by robert j sawyer is the second book in the neanderthal parallax a set of three novels exploring interaction between neanderthals and homo sapiens via parallel universes hominids the story is a bit dialog heavy the conversations between the neanderthal male named ponter and a human woman named mary with all the names religious overtones move the story along somewhat but mostly give sawyer mouthpieces for admittedly interesting comments on religion science politics and culture includes this admirable idea however unrealistic about declaring war political leaders declaring war should do it right here

3174386 in all the years we have worked with americas top dealers one thing has remained constant radio advertising delivers a better return on investment than newspaper advertising
3174387 the free fall in newspaper readership has dealers everywhere scrambling to reposition advertising dollars
3174388 newspapers are no longer the dominant ad medium they once were for car dealers yet local radio remains a powerful force
3174389 in recent years weve watched internet usage overtake newspaper in almost every market we track
3174390 todays consumers lead very busy lives and the internet provides fast easy access to the specific information customers want exactly when they want it newspapers simply cant do that
3174391 car dealers have developed a much better understanding of what their customers want from their dealer web sites
3174392 dealers are building web sites that are more interactive up to date and increasingly efficient for their users
3174393 we conduct intensive customer research in every one of those dealerships
3174394 for years car dealers have complained that half their ad dollars are well spent and the other half is wasted the only problem is they cant tell which half is which
3174395 every market is different but through cbc research were able to tailor custom media recommendations for all our clients
3174396 advertise in the newspaper everyone reads the newspaper there are lots of radio stations but only one newspaper
3174397 with all the billions of dollars spent in media each year why has no one ever comparison tested the media in a series of controlled experiments
3174398 for the test the manufacturer of a shampoo selected territories in which his sales had been equal and satisfactory over a period of years an advertising campaign with increased appropriations was prepared and at the end of the test period sales increases were used as the gauge of the merit of the medium in territory no 1 where newspaper advertising was used the sales were increased by 3 percent in territory no 2 where radio only was used they were increased 40 percent
3174399 i have always believed that writing advertisements is the second most profitable form of writing the first of course is ransom notes
3174400 c hallengers to powerful incumbents candidates and their supporters from smaller parties like the greens and the libertarians often complain theyre hurt by too little coverage
3174401 critics of both the press and of politics say the comparative silence on alternative candidates and policies reinforces the two party dominance of republicans and democrats narrows the range of political thought and denies voters more choices
3174402 a matter of space every inch of copy we would give a minor candidate subtracts from the space available for covering the candidates our readers are most likely to vote for
3174403 journalists cannot and should not give equal coverage to all candidates
3174404 equal coverage for say ralph nader as to republicans john mccain and democrat barack obama would quite simply distort the reality of the presidential race
3174405 it would be inaccurate to suggest by the amount of coverage that all the candidates were competing at the same level
3174406 its the candidates responsibility after all to knock on doors shake hands at factory gates kiss babies at the state fair inspire volunteers to help them campaign and raise their profiles high enough to warrant more coverage

3174424 when elderly patients complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old
3174425 they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal

3174435 when i hear someone say something about selfish play i challenge anybody to look at the tape of every game from march 31 to the present and show me an example of somebody being selfish
3174436 he shouldnt have said it to the writers he should have said it to me or the teammate hes directing it at
3174437 its the wrong way to send a message you dont do that in the paper you do that internally
3174438 i dont know who he is directing it at until you give a specific example
3174439 ive taken him out of games and hes mad with an attitude of how can you take me out of the game i like that you want him to feel that way hes not quitting and hes getting after it
3174440 its a very significant pull i dont know if well see willie again the rest of this year
3174441 willie plays so hard that if you get him back you know hes going to go hard so you have to make sure the thing is absolutely 100 percent healthy before you bring him back because hell pull it again we want to let him get strong again

3174445 our industrial business in australia has made good progress with solid increases in revenue and earnings
3174446 will largely depend on the performance in the final quarter where 33 per cent of earnings before interest and tax traditionally occurs and there being no further deterioration in the new zealand trading environment
3174447 continued solid performances from our australian and asian businesses give the board confidence that apn is well placed to take advantage of improvements in underlying trading conditions in each of our major markets
3174448 these are a good set of results against the background of the global credit crisis
3174449 our australian and asian businesses have performed well during the period with in particular our outdoor business being the standout performer
3174450 our new zealand businesses have been affected throughout the period by the economic slowdown with a number of our major advertisers cutting back advertising plans
3174451 we are also announcing today the acquisition of media1 new zealands third largest outdoor advertising business cementing our position as the largest outdoor operator in that market
3174452 whilst we have undoubtedly seen some project creep during the half particularly in relation to our australian publishing business all projects are now fully operational

3174470 disclosed to the sfo evidence that had come to light suggesting that in 2002 the company may have indirectly made two payments to the iraqi regime in breach of un sanctions
3174471 has recently been notified of allegations that certain historical contracts may have been procured through corrupt acts
3174472 the company will continue to cooperate voluntarily and fully as appropriate with the sfo
3174473 the board of the company is committed to the current in depth review of policies and procedures and the subsequent training to ensure that all employees and international representatives comply fully with the mabey group code of ethics
3174474 one of the things the industry has long called for is to move on from a one size fits all mentality to one that reflects regional need customers will be hoping the regulator will reflect this regional diversity in the final determinations in 2009
3174475 our view is that realistic investment in renewing assets cant be put off indefinitely at least it cant without risking a fall off in service that customers would hate and could seriously damage the economy and the environment
3174476 some of this increase is also aimed for the first time at dealing with climate change related issues from improving the flood resilience of critical infrastructure to widespread plans to increase household metering
3174477 ofwat have a very difficult task in balancing the requirement for significant investment with customers priorities not to see bills increase more than is necessary
3174478 water and sewerage prices between 2010 and 2015 need to be set in line with what customers are willing and able to pay and companies should deliver a package of benefits in line with what consumers see as a priority
3174479 the consumer council for water has encouraged water companies to give extra back to consumers and this has resulted in 130m of benefits in two years we will take the same approach in pressing ofwat and the companies to be guided by the needs of consumers up to 2015

3174495 we believe that high inflation will continue to be a threat in the next five years as policy rates are very low and commodity markets are very tight it will probably take a volker style effort of hiking rates aggressively to fight inflation eventually paul volker was chairman of the us federal reserve from 1979 to 1987 however in the next 12 months inflation will be falling and that is likely to be an important event for the market
3174496 although pockets of stronger performance do exist in the manufacturing world it is a real concern that orders and output have fallen and are set to fall again there is no doubt this is a challenging time for many small and medium sized firms many are trying to stay on top of higher energy and raw material costs and are finding it difficult to pass these on to customers through higher prices
3174497 the sharp falls in oil gas and wholesale food prices seen in recent weeks suggest that price pressures right at the start of the inflation pipeline may be close to a peak
3174498 endemol has always grown through acquisitions we are in an exploratory phase we have many projects open itv is just one of many
3174499 a clean disposal of the two businesses would obviously make sense loss elimination from overseas gives management one less thing to worry about and the prospect of italy in particular getting a lot worse before it gets better is a real one that said getting out cleanly will not be easy
3174500 the management of ennstone is considering a number of options open to it to strengthen the balance sheet we think these are more likely to take the form of either asset disposals or an equity fundraising the preference has to be for the former which could include all or part disposal of one of its overseas businesses a full update will be available at the interims in september which will allow us to better appraise the situation as it develops
3174501 we are going to do everything in our power to bring the suspect or suspects responsible for this to justice
3174502 it is pretty neutral we are probably spending almost as much in euros and dollars as we are selling in those currencies
3174503 we are seeing wage pressure not helped by the inflation figures
3174504 we have gone through a two year spiral of energy and raw material rises which we have been unable to pass on to customers
3174505 i think we have probably got 12 to 18 months before we see any real improvement
3174506 we owe it to our childrens children to preserve it
3174507 put together a new application to herefordshire for four turbines
3174508 the ardrossan wind farm has been overwhelmingly accepted by local people instead of spoiling the landscape we believe it has been enhanced the turbines are impressive looking bring a calming effect to the town and contrary to the belief that they would be noisy we have found them to be silent workhorses
3174509 we can provide all the electricity oil gas and petrochemicals that people need without causing harm to the environment

3174513 it would be nice if you would dispose of your litter
3174514 our goal is clear to move beyond a belief in the protestant work ethic alone to a modern vision of ethical work
3174515 it is not the slightest bit involving and is sadly lacking not only in substance but also in basic narrative structure it is hard to make poetry out of confusion
3174516 but he will undoubtedly be massacred by the film critics
3174517 it seemed he got lost in his car somewhere in the centovalli region
3174518 its problems of rhythm and the total absurdity of certain scenes are topped off by the platitude of the infrequent dialogue which ends up making everything insipid
3174519 those for whom his books are all about the sex scenes also risk disappointment the film has only got one the pen suits him much better than the camera
3174520 houellebecq hasnt managed to make a film with the same impact as his writing it is the usual modernist fare
3174521 we are so proud of terry and are going to miss him terribly he was true to his art and respected by all the industry
3174522 he was a very powerful character actor able to play villains and nice roles with ease he was particularly good at playing pinter roles which were very difficult
3174523 he had weight on stage this strong dominating physical presence when he came on there was a sense of something dangerous
3174524 this is a great conservation success and shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3174525 we are moving petrol prices down in order to ensure we offer the best price locally
3174526 cheapest prices in many southern towns are still two to three pence per litre above what drivers are paying in areas where competitive supermarkets are engaged in a dogfight
3174527 since the all time high of 119 7p a litre for petrol and 133 25p for diesel the wholesale price for petrol coming into the uk has fallen 18 and 22 for diesel
3174528 this has yet to be reflected in average uk prices
3174529 he should not be made a scapegoat over this issue he is by far the best person to lead the qca through this situation
3174530 no significant change in the ethnic social class or age profile of accepted applicants across the four years 2004 5 2007 8
3174531 its encouraging to see from this report that demand for higher education remains solid despite various changes to the system there continues to be real growth in the number of applications and a pattern of stability in recruitment
3174532 whilst it is encouraging that student numbers have not decreased in our universities it is extremely worrying that there has been no change in the number of students from the very backgrounds the government is spending considerable sums of money on persuading to apply
3174533 with applications to university up significantly and the proportions from lower socio economic groups increasing i am confident the new system is working in major part this is because we have a better fairer and more progressive system of student financial support with no one paying tuition fees before university and because we have brought back and greatly expanded access to non repayable student grants

3174540 tighter credit conditions in terms of both collateral requirements and generally wider lending margins is impairing housing market activity
3174541 in terms of the outlook the july survey lends further support to the notion that activity may be beginning to stabilise albeit at a low level
3174542 it has been an encouraging month for sales 25 up on june and just 20 down on july 2007
3174543 conditions are more difficult even than the 1990s because of a lack of first time buyers entering the market due to a lack of available mortgage funding
3174544 the only properties attracting any interest are those offered at greatly discounted prices ie repossessions new builds on large developments and the older rural properties the first time buyer is on the list of endangered species

3174559 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state

3174566 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
3174567 the idea that the white house had anything to do with a forged letter purportedly from habbush to saddam is absurd
3174568 look the united states the white house was not going to ask somebody to forge a letter on something of this importance
3174569 from the dawn of time human beings have been attentive to signs of distinction the approach of a tribe with a different manner or dress posture or skin color the swift sizing up of friend or foe and acting upon it upon suspicion was often a matter of survival those faculties became finely tuned over thousands of years now in a world of vivid colliding images and technologys bequest of awesomely powerful weapons we struggle to leap forward to reshape instinct enough to reach across the divides of us and them peak and valley and to do it in time

3174615 the super bowl may be 2 500 miles away but it might as well be here as it fills up every avenue of the casino people actually camp out the night before just to get a seat in here

3174648 it would be utterly unacceptable for russia to try and destabilise a democratically elected government on its border with a view to any sort of regime change
3174649 the international community would view that extraordinarily dimly and would have diplomatic consequences for russia
3174650 i said this violence is unacceptable i was very firm with vladimir putin hopefully this will get resolved peacefully
3174651 however there has been a shocking lack of consultation with local authorities and disregard for the wishes of local people
3174652 some councillors are quite understandably furious that they have not been adequately consulted on what is happening in their area
3174653 its pure folly to dump this kind of accommodation into the middle of a residential street without properly asking for the councils views
3174654 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
3174655 military personnel can be prevented from leaving the armed forces upon completing their enlistment terms

3174660 es gab keine alternative nachdem georgien angefangen hat mit dieser grausamen offensive auch mit raketenangriffen
3174661 bekurow in l ndern wie deutschland und frankreich scheinen sich die medien m he zu geben den konflikt zu verstehen und ausgewogen zu berichten das sagen auch meine kollegen aber vor allem ber cnn und auch ber die bbc bin ich schockiert da sind im bild ganz klar georgische kampfjets zu sehen im text wird von russischen gesprochen und wenn im bild ossetische tote sind spricht der reporter von georgischen opfern wenn ich das sehe f hle ich mich hilflos
3174662 heute de glauben sie nicht dass da jemand in den tv redaktionen im aktualit tsdruck die bilder falsch zugeordnet oder interpretiert haben k nnte bekurow nein so offensichtliche fehler kann man nicht machen das ist absicht die osseten haben in den augen der welt ffentlichkeit die falschen helfer und werden deshalb voreilig als separatisten abgestempelt aber meiner meinung nach ist es das erste mal in der modernen geschichte dass russland in den kaukasus nicht als angreifer kommt sondern um die menschen zu verteidigen ich sage es noch mal georgien hat angefangen mit den angriffen
3174663 es waren die russen die anfingen sie sind in der nacht auf freitag einmarschiert nur deshalb stie en georgische streitkr fte nach s dossetien vor um den russen den nachschub abzuschneiden
3174664 russland hat die er ffnung der olympischen spiele dazu genutzt um sozusagen in ihrem windschatten einzumarschieren
3174665 wie der konflikt zu l sen ist im moment wohl gar nicht m sste man aus heutiger sicht sagen wenn man denn ehrlich ist sp ter vielleicht dadurch dass die s dosseten nach russland bersiedeln was nat rlich den bitteren beigeschmack einer deportation h tte und an stalins vertreibungen w hrend der vierziger jahre erinnern w rde die abchasen aber brauchen eine weitgehende autonomie

3174670 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3174671 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy
3174672 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3174673 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3174674 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3174675 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3174676 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3174677 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3174678 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3174679 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3174680 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3174681 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3174682 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3174683 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3174684 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3174685 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3174686 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3174687 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3174688 it keeps you sane man im telling you if you just work and work and work and you dont play man you would go nuts
3174689 and the next thing you know one day youre just going to go aaaarrrggghhh
3174690 it was almost like being a rookie again you have to learn a whole new system a whole different environment
3174691 especially the playbook the terminology was different pretend like they would say c and c meant to do no 1 but with the giants c meant no 2 see so i had to adjust to it and sometimes it would be wrong
3174692 when you think think think think think think think think it kind of impedes your natural abilities
3174693 am i doing the right thing you know so when youre flowing you cant be thinking about what youre doing the games being played
3174694 you had to write down some things to think about or some goals and stuff like that stay sane youve got to just try to be yourself and just somehow get away every chance you get
3174695 by and large he has had a very good training camp
3174696 they did a nice job putting a hat right on it and he was a little loose with the handling he will catch a lot more balls in that spot and we expect him to hold on to them first and foremost
3174697 mr musharraf is going to fight these charges on a moral ground to try to disprove them but when it comes to the numbers i think hes lost it
3174698 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the 1bn a year the americans have been giving for the armed forces the army has been getting between the range of 250m to 300m 125m to 150m reimbursement for what they do but where is the rest of the money
3174699 absolutely president musharraf will prove all this wrong there is no way he will quit now quietly while being blamed for corruption
3174700 negotiations are going on for a safe exit to be given to him general kayani will be meeting mr musharraf later this evening
3174701 shahbaz sharif mr sharifs younger brother is acting as the interlocutor for the coalition i think the americans and the army are demanding he be given safe passage impeachment would mean a huge distraction from the war on terror
3174702 four of the last five months have now seen negative like for like annual sales growth and in july every sector except food recorded falls
3174703 frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3174704 these pictures look like common or garden snaps to me i cant see any evidence of photoshop trickery
3174705 his feet were missing but thats no surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain
3174706 i have been doing a lot of thinking over the past few days about australia more than i would have done if i was still just a player about the structure i want and to get guys into certain positions so they can grow used to their roles in the side and deliver the goods
3174707 he said we will see but the travel and being away from his family is the problem for steve
3174708 i totally respect the man for the decision he made it would be lovely to have him first change for us with the white ball but you dont always get what you want in life
3174709 big stevie will be huge for us against australia you have seen how important he is this week i am going to be looking after him the best i can but also making sure i get the best out of him he has experienced international cricket again and he loves it i am definitely going to get the best out of steve harmison
3174710 i am very happy with flintoff at six and having the attacking option of the extra bowler
3174711 i want flintoff batting at six against australia next year
3174712 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3174713 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3174714 i didnt blow anything and so i can go home happy with my performance
3174715 but unfortunately its a partnership you both have to be on the top of your game i wasnt on the top of my game but tom was nowhere near the top of his
3174716 i knew we were capable of a medal but i knew it would depend on how tom performed i out dived thomas today and thats not something that normally happens and that to me is because tom had a lot more pressure on him than i did tom was very nervous more so than ever before and i think he really struggled to get through the competition
3174717 peking tom why everyones looking at this 14 year old darling diver
3174718 i think thats the sole reason why it went the way it did
3174719 i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone
3174720 that is thomas over nervous that is how it was today today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3174721 i was quite disappointed but it was a great experience and i really enjoyed myself i had so much fun out there thats all you can ask getting the experience
3174722 the powerful human impulse to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
3174723 when there are limited resources applying the rule of rescue may mean other people will not have the care or treatment they need
3174724 we shouldnt have a formal rule of rescue because our general guidance took into account provision for exceptional cases that can allow the institute to recommend treatment above our normal cost threshold
3174725 we would be opposed to ignoring a rule of rescue when it introduces a degree of flexibility around extreme cases so what if you waste a few pounds if you are doing your best for humanity
3174726 we plough billions into cancer research but the benefits of that research some remarkable drug treatments are not available to all who need them patients are disregarded and given up on because they cannot get the drugs they need
3174727 i may have got what is close to an apology but they still dont admit culpability
3174728 i am going to fight them all the way to get them to admit an error was made the health board told my solicitor that there was no evidence of individual incompetence or negligence and that they had no case to answer and that was it
3174729 i want them to admit something went wrong and to explain why
3174730 the clinical course of action agreed for mr ball was arrived at following the review of all relevant information test results scans x rays etc by a multi disciplinary group of clinicians
3174731 it was considered to be the appropriate action based on all this information
3174732 nhs grampian deeply regrets that with hindsight the procedure that mr ball underwent may not have been necessary
3174733 mr balls case notes have been reviewed we understand that he is pursuing a legal claim and has expressed a view that he has a right to expect a full explanation from nhs grampian
3174734 we intend making urgent contact with mr ball to offer him a face to face meeting to review the clinical circumstances of his care without prejudice to any legal action he chooses to pursue
3174735 well ok so you know how youre throwing a birthday party for me
3174736 i want you to use the money you were going to spend on the party and buy toys i want to go to an orphanage for my birthday and distribute toys to the children i mean why are we throwing a party and feeding people who can feed themselves isnt it more rewarding to see smiling faces from children who need care

3174738 i expect the trade balance will weaken in the months ahead
3174739 i suspect the weaker dollar is going to be a mixed blessing
3174740 the renewed decline in the canadian dollar will provide some needed earnings breathing room for many exporters and local retailers

3174744 at first glance some water companies such as dwr cymru welsh water wessex water severn trent water and yorkshire water seem to have taken this to heart and said that they can continue to meet their obligations to deliver a safe reliable service provide further benefits to consumers and do this without raising prices much above the rate of inflation if at all
3174745 other water companies such as southern water sutton and east surrey bristol water south east water folkestone and dover and cambridge water have proposed bill increases of over 20 per cent above the rate of inflation
3174746 the consumer council for water believes that many customers will be concerned with price rises on this scale especially in light of other household bill increases customers will want to see the justification for any proposed price increases to understand exactly what they will get for the extra money

3174753 every method should either be a command that performs an action or a query that returns data to the caller but not both more formally methods should return a value only if they are referentially transparent and hence possess no side effects

3174760 dont expect chris eccleston as dr who for too long
3174761 i havent been asked to play the doctor i havent been approached at all
3174762 as far as i know its not up for grabs
3174763 at the end of this season you are led to believe that the doctor could be dead after hes saved his companion rose played by billie piper and the earth from the daleks
3174764 but it turns out that theres a way for rose to save him and thats how the second season starts
3174765 so she gets back to the tardis and is able to get the doctor brought back to life if chris is still in the role no problems hes been brilliant and it will be good to have him back
3174766 if david is in the role it will just be explained as the doctor using up one of his regenerations which has happened many times before
3174767 lining up replacements isnt bad form the bbc has a hit on its hands and is just doing what it can to keep it going
3174768 ive never made any secret that im a big fan of doctor who and its the reason i got into acting but i havent been asked to play the doctor i havent been approached at all
3174769 it would be a great role to play but as far as i know its not up for grabs
3174770 even if christopher returns for a second season and wants out after that david will get the role he is the hot favourite at the moment
3174771 hes a fan and incredibly talented as anyone who saw him on casanova will testify
3174772 hed be great for bringing in lady viewers in the same way that billie piper is bringing in the blokes

3174782 if youre not paying attention to climate change thats akin to not thinking about fire insurance until you smell smoke
3174783 well theres smoke in the air now the alarm is ringing your shareholders customers regulators and insurers are demanding to see your climate mitigation strategy taking the battery out of the smoke detector and adopting a wait and see strategy is nothing short of reckless

3174787 we are fulfilling our agreement with the georgian government that in an emergency we would assist them in redeploying their troops
3174788 we are honoring that commitment and we are following through with that
3174789 commanders on the ground are making necessary adjustments to mitigate any of the impact of the loss of georgian forces
3174790 quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt at the battle space to account for their loss
3174791 i not only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitriy medvedev
3174792 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3174793 there needs to be an international mediation there for the south ossetia issue
3174794 a wolf pack of at least 30 thugs viciously attacked two hero ex marines in brooklyn after they rescued a teenage girl who was being assaulted police and witnesses said yesterday
3174795 i asked her do you need help she said yes
3174796 she was screaming and all we did was look to help her
3174797 the idea of the center is not only to help sailors and marines in distress but to promote good stress management and promote psychological health so it starts when people come into boot camp and lasts all of the way until they graduate from war college
3174798 the idea is that we get past the concept of just dealing with things when they are in crisis and hopefully promote a system of addressing stress and addressing our ability to cope with it so we rarely get into a crisis mode
3174799 one of the things that i like to look at when people are training and they go through drills is how can we incorporate stress training into that so that they are more aware of when they are dealing with
3174800 when we talk about operational stress were talking about that unique set of circumstances that people have when they are deployed or when they are in the jobs that they do
3174801 for example somebody who works on the deck of an aircraft carrier has a much different level of stress than someone who is a civilian and works in an office building downtown
3174802 combat stress of course is the stress that occurs when you are in combat the extreme set of circumstances when your life is in danger and when you have to make life and death decisions quickly and when you are under extreme pressure
3174803 the center has four major divisions knowledge management programs research facilitation and strategic communications
3174804 pain has an element of blank it cannot recollect when it began or if there were a day when it was not it has no future but itself its infinite realms contain its past enlightened to perceive new periods of pain
3174805 oh all men are useless no wonder he couldnt get the job done in time
3174806 are you a mother lets see what kind of job you want to do
3174807 on a scale depth and breadth which few of us could have imagined even
3174808 i am not saying every broken family produces dysfunctional children but i am saying that almost every dysfunctional child is the product of a broken family
3174809 families are the cells which make up the body of society if the cells are unhealthy and undernourished or at worse cancerous and growing haphazard and out of control in the end the body succumbs
3174810 in some of the more heavily populated urban areas family life is quite frankly in meltdown or completely unrecognisable it is on an epidemic scale in some areas of the country family life in the old sense no longer exists
3174811 single parents often do a fantastic job but a great many perhaps through no fault of their own do not
3174812 a large number of families now consist of children being brought up by mothers who have children by a number of different fathers none of whom take any part in their lives or support or upbringing
3174813 these are not isolated oneoff cases they are part of the stock in trade of the family courts
3174814 almost all societys ills can be traced directly to the collapse of family life we all know it examine the background of almost every child in the care system or the youth justice system and you will discover a broken family
3174815 ditto the drug addict ditto the binge drinker ditto those children who are truanting or who cannot behave at school
3174816 scratch the surface of these cases and you invariably find a miserable family overseen by a dysfunctional and fractured parental relationship or none at all
3174817 it is as big a threat to our society as terrorism street crime or drugs but far more insidious it will be more destructive than any economic decline caused by international markets
3174818 the van was hit on the drivers side rear and then spun 360 degrees in the roadway and flipped twice before coming to rest back in its normal position
3174819 all of the glass on the drivers side was broken out and during one of those two flips the baby was thrown out of the van still in his car seat
3174820 i believe he was taken to wakemed mainly as a precaution because of his age thankfully things turned out a whole lot better than they could have
3174821 by 2010 i think the u s troop presence could be halved to 70 000
3174822 his ideas seem to be in isolation of an iraq that is deeply fragmented and fracturing and assuming that training and mentoring of security forces will be the magic glue that holds the country together
3174823 when other elements are necessary for success like a common sense of national identity and a consensus on power sharing among key groups in a sense the plan is stuck in the tactics of military assistance and training and fails to answer the core questions of what is iraq how its leaders are going to rule iraq and what are the instruments of power that will enable them to provide their country with law and order and justice
3174824 withdrawal is the one thing that all of the factions in iraq agree on and will motivate the government in iraq to do what they need to do to bring about meaningful reconciliation
3174825 but in contrast to the bush administrations current approach americas support to iraq would not come for free
3174826 to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq
3174827 phased withdrawal will encourage iraqis to take the lead in securing their own country and making political compromises
3174828 the continued presence in iraq of so called residual forces beyond the minimum needed for standard embassy protection would be a serious mistake
3174829 any such troops would become a magnet for insurgent attacks and unless they did nothing at all would inevitably become players in iraqs domestic political disputes thus forcing the united states to continue to play referee to iraqs civil conflicts
3174830 a backdoor way of continuing the war almost indefinitely in the future
3174831 getting out giving up admitting defeat are not what we expect from the psychology of newly elected presidents who have just overcome all odds and battled through to personal victory
3174832 planning for withdrawals might begin on day one but the plans will be hostage to events
3174833 any decision like this has to be based on conditions in iraq and in the region
3174834 starts with a vision but theres no effort at contingency planning if the vision doesnt end up being achieved
3174835 getting out of iraq will require just as much resolution as it took to get in and the same kind of resolution a willingness to ignore the consequences
3174836 my people on vulcan have been playing this game for ages
3174837 helped inspire my imagination of what mysteries the universe might in fact hold
3174838 id like to think that very same imagination is what fuels my desire and drive as a game designer

3174840 this is well deserved recognition for the development in shauns game particularly this season
3174841 he has provided pace and some of his work around the stoppages on saturday was very good
3174842 the continued development of our young players is important for our progress and shaun is one of the young players who is setting a great example in the manner in which he approaches his game

3174845 rankings have become an unnecessary evil in the eyes of most colleges but you just have to deal with them even if the news is unfavorable
3174846 that updating had been in the plans for a long time
3174847 but its probably fair to say the negative publicity sped up the plan slightly
3174848 its something we all have to pay very close attention to
3174849 they have become an unnecessary evil in the eyes of most colleges
3174850 but you just have to deal with them even if the news is unfavorable
3174851 as college costs go up i think families are thinking more carefully about the college search
3174852 and theyre hungry for some kind of consumer guide for higher education
3174853 when a school appears on our coveted lists they tend to trumpet that fact
3174854 if theyre on one of our less coveted lists some of them generally speaking try to poke holes in our methodology
3174855 the reason we created this book is because we wanted to make college bound students very savvy college shoppers
3174856 cars are ranked on levels of reliability movies are ranked it has become part of who we are as a society and i dont see it disappearing
3174857 there was a time when we were less well known and i think we emerged in the rankings and that helped us become better known and respected
3174858 at this point however i think our reputation takes precedence over the rankings
3174859 if you dont know anything about colleges and universities the rankings give you something to start with
3174860 but i think people who are sharp dont depend on them
3174861 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation

3174869 man is the only animal that blushes or needs to
3174870 we blush with embarrassment with shyness with uncertainty with a sense of exposure
3174871 blushing is a kind of glass bottomed boat enabling us to look at the depths upon which our ordinary moments float
3174872 there can be few experiences so all consuming as vomiting

3174881 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3174882 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3174883 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3174884 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3174885 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3174886 we owe it to our childrens children to preserve it
3174887 put together a new application to herefordshire for four turbines
3174888 the ardrossan wind farm has been overwhelmingly accepted by local people instead of spoiling the landscape we believe it has been enhanced the turbines are impressive looking bring a calming effect to the town and contrary to the belief that they would be noisy we have found them to be silent workhorses
3174889 wealth is about so much more than pounds or euros or dollars can ever measure its time we admitted that theres more to life than money its time we focused not just on gdp but on gwb general well being

3174895 we can provide all the electricity oil gas and petrochemicals that people need without causing harm to the environment

3174907 we are so proud of terry and are going to miss him terribly he was true to his art and respected by all the industry
3174908 he was a very powerful character actor able to play villains and nice roles with ease he was particularly good at playing pinter roles which were very difficult
3174909 he had weight on stage this strong dominating physical presence when he came on there was a sense of something dangerous

3174912 eine solche milit roffensive im 21 jahrhundert ist nicht hinnehmbar
3174913 sollten diese berichte zutreffen w rde das russische vorgehen eine dramatische und brutale eskalation des konflikts in georgien darstellen
3174914 dies ist ein versuch georgien v llig zu erobern und zu zerst ren

3174916 wir wissen nicht mehr wo f r die russischen invasoren die grenze ist
3174917 russland will scheinbar die demokratisch gew hlte regierung von georgien st rzen und das land okkupieren
3174918 wir brauchen eine von georgien auf der einen sowie von s dossetien und abchasien auf der anderen seite unterzeichnete vereinbarung dass sie in der zukunft niemals wieder gewalt anwenden werden
3174919 i take big pride in protecting the football especially in the red zone ill clean that up work on that mistake
3174920 if you ask every guy what we see out of chad that ball comes out on time receivers turn their heads and its almost hitting them in the face sometimes its amazing to see that on day one
3174921 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
3174922 i felt like my little 4 year old going to his first football camp having no idea where to go or what to do pennington said
3174923 ill work to get the logistics of how we do things and make it a little easier on me
3174924 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3174925 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3174926 its nice to be known for something good like that
3174927 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3174928 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3174929 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality hes that type of guy thats going to put his head down and barrel on
3174930 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning
3174931 if ever there was a golf course you could discount a poor round this would be the one
3174932 would i have liked both of them to have played better of course theres three weeks to go i like both of them a lot so i dont think you can say that rocco choked yesterday and i really dont think j b has any choke in him
3174933 that was very meaningful to them and i hope a very good sign
3174934 the postings on the bachmans web site are coming in from around the world and
3174935 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
3174936 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
3174937 today was a big win for us a big win
3174938 we have to refocus and not allow this to cross over into this road trip
3174939 i didnt want to let the team down like i did previously
3174940 i got in there worked the count and got the pitch that i was waiting for
3174941 you just keep going out there and keep battling its all you can do
3174942 it was real big for these guys to really pull together and come back
3174943 especially 5 1 down and didnt look like anything was going our way at all
3174944 getting a veteran that may slip through the waiver process may look good on paper create a buzz for the fans and make it look like were trying to fill the spot he said
3174945 if we dont really believe that that will translate into success in this ballpark and thats very key in this ballpark then it doesnt make sense to do it
3174946 youre better off bringing someone that has been trained specifically in our minor league system major league spring training has gotten experience in the ballpark
3174947 he is a player with tremendous work ethic and showed last year that he is a player that can contribute pistons president of basketball operations joe dumars said in a statement
3174948 wed like to have c j help us down the stretch but he knows his elbow better than anyone else and he didnt feel he could help the club daniels wrote in an e mail response
3174949 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3174950 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3174951 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming wide receiver jerricho cotchery said monday
3174952 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3174953 not many people realize how quick his release is tight end bubba franks said
3174954 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3174955 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here keller said
3174956 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3174957 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field cotchery said
3174958 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming said keller a rookie tight end
3174959 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3174960 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there said franks who played with favre for eight years in green bay
3174961 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3174962 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3174963 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3174964 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different keller said
3174965 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3174966 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire keller said after a few minutes of standing in front of a jugs machine and catching footballs
3174967 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3174968 he does like to spread the ball around a lot baker said
3174969 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play
3174970 die weltweite verbreitung des hochgradig pathogenen h5n1 vogelgrippevirus war anlass f r die weltgesundheitsbeh rde ihre grosse sorge bez glich der m glichkeit zum ausdruck zu bringen dass das virus k nftig von mensch zu mensch bertragen werden k nne
3174971 dar ber hinaus hat die sich entwickelnde resistenz gegen zwei bew hrte anti influenza wirkstoffe n mlich oseltamivir tamiflu r und zanamivir relenza r sowie der mangel an geeigneten impfstoffen die notwendigkeit verst rkt neue antivirale wirkstoffe zu entwickeln
3174972 infolgedessen bin ich sehr erfreut an den vorklinischen forschungsarbeiten dieses innovativen antiviralen wirkstoffkandidaten beteiligt zu sein und freue mich auf die fortsetzung der erfolgreichen zusammenarbeit mit canopus biopharma auf diesem gebiet
3174973 es ist m glich dass eine h here dosierung des statins als in der studie verwendet eine noch gr ssere wirksamkeit zur folge haben wird statc tm scheint auch wirksamer zu sein wenn es vorbeugend verabreicht wird
3174974 wir sind auch vom potenzial dieser verbindung im vergleich zu anderen derzeit verf gbaren grippemitteln sehr angetan es steht ausser frage dass es einen grossen weltweiten bedarf an einer berlegenen kosteng nstigen und reichlich verf gbaren alternative f r den kampf gegen die grippe gibt
3174975 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3174976 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3174977 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3174978 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3174979 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3174980 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3174981 its a real nuisance the urine has made its way into the machine and has affected it several times it then has to be cleaned up by somebody
3174982 its all fine to think this is bit of a laugh but quite frankly there is a toilet on the floor directly underneath the area hes done this hes just being disgusting
3174983 he pees up the air in a big arc so it goes in the coin slot and out the hole where people collect their tickets its absolutely disgusting

3174991 the scratched glass weve developed is actually a photonic integrated circuit
3174992 this circuit uses the scratch as a guide or a switching path for information like when trains are switched from one track to another except this switch takes only one picosecond to change tracks this means that in one second the switch is turning on and off about one million times we are talking about photonic technology that has terabit per second capacity
3174993 we now use electronics for switching and that has been okay but as we move toward a more tech savvy future there is a demand for instant web gratification
3174994 photonic technology delivers whats needed and more importantly whats wanted

3175009 incredible as it seems our detection of the dark energy may provide evidence that the universe will ultimately decay
3175010 if we attempt to apply quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole and if our present state is unstable then what sets the clock that governs decay
3175011 once we determine our current state by observations have we effectively determined that the clock is not running at late times if so as incredible as it may seem our detection of dark energy may imply both an unstable universe and a short life expectancy
3175012 in short cosmological observations may suggest that the quantum state of our universe is such that the probability of long term survival is limited
3175013 i did not mean to imply causality namely that our measurement itself reduces the lifetime of the universe but rather that by being able to make our measurement we may thus conclude that we may not be in the late decay stage
3175014 this means the mass of these x ray emitting clouds is much less than we initially thought it was
3175015 this is also telling us there is fractionally more iron and other metals than we previously thought
3175016 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is

3175021 we havent drawn a conclusion that alcohol and drug use is a serious problem or not a serious problem but any drug or alcohol use is a concern from the safety standpoint
3175022 do i think drugs and alcohol in the industry are a problem
3175023 yes i do and they have been for years but drugs and alcohol didnt have anything to do with the real issue of why my brother was killed
3175024 it was very obvious these guys were on a first name basis with the bartenders
3175025 if they consume any alcohol and go on site its grounds for termination
3175026 this type of behavior has been encountered on our las vegas construction projects in the past
3175027 we rely on trades to provide us with responsible well trained professionals if we determine any of our policies were violated we will take immediate and appropriate action
3175028 we have secured the full support of the unions in assisting us in this process and expected termination of the individuals who can be identified
3175029 remains confident in perini building companys ability to operate a safe and professional work site enforce workplace regulations and take prompt disciplinary action when appropriate
3175030 perini senior management is investigating the allegations raised by the report
3175031 we expect their efforts will be met with cooperation from every union and subcontractor working at citycenter
3175032 if an nevada osha inspector had a suspicion that an employee was under the influence they would notify the employer particularly if the employee were operating equipment
3175033 our position with osha has been that we just havent seen the type of attentiveness that we think this body needs to have
3175034 this is potentially obviously very dangerous behavior which has ramifications of hurting other people on the job site that have nothing to do with it except they are coming to work trying to make an honest living playing by the rules
3175035 if this behavior is as you explain it to me it is unacceptable
3175036 these are issues that are handled in collective bargaining agreements with the employers these actions are unacceptable and cant be tolerated
3175037 i know these guys should never have been permitted to work
3175038 does not release such reports to persons who are not legal next of kin to a decedent the reason we do not disclose these reports is to maintain the confidentiality of medical information contained in such reports
3175039 not open to public inspection upon demand because disclosure would be contrary to a strong public policy
3175040 while cognizant that public inspection is the rule and secrecy the exception we can ascertain no public interest in disclosure sufficient to outweigh the public policy of confidentiality of personal medical information

3175127 die weltweite verbreitung des hochgradig pathogenen h5n1 vogelgrippevirus war anlass f r die weltgesundheitsbeh rde ihre grosse sorge bez glich der m glichkeit zum ausdruck zu bringen dass das virus k nftig von mensch zu mensch bertragen werden k nne
3175128 dar ber hinaus hat die sich entwickelnde resistenz gegen zwei bew hrte anti influenza wirkstoffe n mlich oseltamivir tamiflu r und zanamivir relenza r sowie der mangel an geeigneten impfstoffen die notwendigkeit verst rkt neue antivirale wirkstoffe zu entwickeln

3175130 es ist m glich dass eine h here dosierung des statins als in der studie verwendet eine noch gr ssere wirksamkeit zur folge haben wird statc tm scheint auch wirksamer zu sein wenn es vorbeugend verabreicht wird
3175131 wir sind auch vom potenzial dieser verbindung im vergleich zu anderen derzeit verf gbaren grippemitteln sehr angetan es steht ausser frage dass es einen grossen weltweiten bedarf an einer berlegenen kosteng nstigen und reichlich verf gbaren alternative f r den kampf gegen die grippe gibt

3175168 most of their immediate needs are being met by local authorities and communities so were filling in gaps at this stage
3175169 but we fear conditions will decline as more refugees arrive and overwhelm existing accommodations
3175170 the school will have no choice but to put displaced families in a gymnasium where there are no toilets showers or clean drinking water
3175171 everyone currently seeking refuge in a school will need to be relocated
3175172 authorities are considering tent camps but with cold weather on the horizon that can only be a temporary solution
3175173 i talked to several extremely distressed women today who have received calls from family members still trapped in rubble or cut off by fighting and begging to be rescued
3175174 i would say most are hopeful that they will be reunited with their families but others fear their loved ones are lost
3175175 macch special one diciamo che sono un grande allenatore di calcio e basta non ho punti deboli al massimo li nascondo
3175176 as someone new i wanted to know if i was doing the exercises right i just wanted some sort of forum to get answers
3175177 as a group we can post questions and keep ourselves motivated
3175178 it was good because the guys who remained were committed and their commitment helped me stay committed
3175179 the only equipment i bought was a jump rope and basketball so i could do the elevated pushups
3175180 but it got to the point that i could do the exercise with the right form so i didnt feel like such a fool
3175181 i have to give a lot of credit to the eating still giving my muscles the fuel they need to stay where theyre at
3175182 i havent regressed i actually feel farther ahead even though im not working out
3175183 the first thing i did was buy myself a cooler so i could bring food to work
3175184 knowing i had healthy food in my cooler was the biggest thing that helped me stay away from the junk food
3175185 its not meant to be written about but to be experienced

3175195 once patients have developed trust in their surgeons they are willing to wait unless their pain becomes unbearable
3175196 we wanted to make sure that the website reflected all of the latest data and information that was available about this topic
3175197 i think the emphasis in the earlier text was a little strong todays vehicles are more efficient when it comes to smog emissions
3175198 our concern is that municipal decision making must be based on facts and scientific evidence
3175199 and we were seeing some municipalities that were focusing on the health impacts of idling based on information that was incorrect and misleading
3175200 what i would like to see is that natural resources canada put the same amount of emphasis on these other driving behaviours that they do on idling
3175201 its gonna make it harder for every city politician to make the argument that we need to have restrictive legislation on idling its not good news for cities anywhere

3175214 i would feel a sense of responsibility to come in and say i want to take part in this survey
3175215 its not enough to talk about we have high incidents of violence we have high incidence of people developing diabetes we have high incidents of sexually transmitted diseases this will be the foundation to begin to make changes
3175216 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3175217 its a sad irony both in terms of health needs and the expense these families incur buying formula
3175218 if mothers who lack resources such as education marital stability income and healthy environments do not receive support to breastfeed the health and well being gap between children born to women with resources and those born to disadvantaged mothers will only widen

3175221 in the case of patients who use proton pump inhibitors this equilibrium
3175222 should be reconsidered with knowledge of the mounting yet incomplete evidence suggesting that proton pump inhibitors increase the risk of fracture
3175223 its related to the forward expectation we have of wobbly growth in europe weak growth in the uk indifferent growth in japan and we have a us fed discussing when it will tighten not if
3175224 we know the next move in euro rates is down and the us is up

3175226 pero es com n que los que tienen padres r gidos terminen siendo r gidos
3175227 son mentes dogm ticas que se niegan a revisar sus creencias a dudar de sus principios y rechazan cualquier informaci n son personas serias y amargadas a quienes no les gusta la l dica por otro lado son normativas y conformistas se apegan a la tradici n y al pasado y por eso est n condenadas a repetir
3175228 es el caso del jefe perfeccionista y r gido que ve una amenaza en las iniciativas de los otros tiene miedo a verse desactualizado y p nico a los cambios por eso con frecuencia empieza a ejercer el poder de manera injusta y no es democr tico
3175229 una mente r gida es perfecta para un trabajo de control de calidad de alg n material radioactivo porque ante la creatividad no funciona
3175230 es el mundo de las certezas de lo que confunden con seguridad y termina convirti ndose en arrogancia
3175231 hay m s seguridad se tiene mayor poder y tambi n hay refuerzo social
3175232 encontramos que las personas que son r gidas son personas que se enferman m s que generan violencia a su alrededor que no son capaces de tener un mejor estilo de vida
3175233 y esto lo digo porque muchos sectores de la poblaci n colombiana son conservadoras en cuanto a sus creencias las investigaciones muestran en esto s que ser conservador no implica ser r gido hay conservadores que son flexibles y revisan yo pienso que algunos grupos sociales pueden ser r gidos pero el colombiano medio pese a no tener inmigraci n de otros pa ses no es r gido

3175239 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear or ate a carcass
3175240 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators

3175242 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive

3175248 no doubt the obesity alarmists will use this studys far fetched conclusion to try to scare us into giving up more of our freedom
3175249 what their arguments spotlight however is not a need to curtail freedom but to expand it
3175250 in warning us of the massive social costs imposed by obesity the obesity alarmists fail to ask a crucial question why are we footing the bill for other peoples health care in the first place
3175251 if the government then begins to dictate how many cookies we can eat or what food mcdonalds can sell it would compound that injustice using a problem caused by paternalism to justify more paternalism
3175252 of course it should worry us if millions of americans are becoming unhealthily overweight those who are genuinely concerned should try to persuade people to eat better and exercise what we must not do is let the state assume coercive control over diets and food supplies
3175253 we may or may not be suffering from an obesity epidemic but there is no question we face an epidemic of paternalism and for that the solution is simple more freedom
3175254 you know what you told me about giving up on god can we talk about that
3175255 we never talked about what your faith was based on and ive been wondering about that do you mind telling me
3175256 at first i was kind of stunned that a city this large would do something like this

3175265 que el fa tenga m s segura la elecci n nacional con astori no quiere decir que mujica no gane la f rmula mujica astori es tan ganadora como la f rmula astori mujica
3175266 the correction that we are seeing is really a reflection of the slowdown of the global economy
3175267 the overseas situation is improving what with the lower oil prices and gains overnight on wall street and this is likely to give stocks an extended boost over the short term

3175277 this woman was working alone within the office and we believe the attack occurred about two oclock in the afternoon
3175278 we are issuing a forensic artists impression of a man who was seen in new city road around the time of the attack and may hold vital information that could move this investigation forward
3175279 i would urge this man to come forward or any person who recognises him to contact the police
3175280 the southern ocean is a hotspot for climate research because its circulation is critical to understanding the earths climate and its huge ice sheet is sensitive to climate change
3175281 southern elephant seals are wide ranging predators that roam all over the southern ocean even under the sea ice in the wintertime a time when conventional ocean observation methods are unable to gather data
3175282 i think this is an extremely exciting new approach for ocean observation which has now been extended to seals roaming the seas around both poles
3175283 the meop animals have contributed over 35 000 observations from the polar seas in the past year and i think it is really fantastic to see how large a contribution the animals can make sending data from below the ice in near real time
3175284 the government has never and will never short change ghanaians
3175285 culpable of short changing ghanaians face the full rigours of the law
3175286 indeed if the npp government had not bought out telecom malaysia at their behest in 2002 there would not be a ghana telecom to privatize today
3175287 it is heartening to see that sports volunteers support and understand the need for children protection measures
3175288 this report identifies the need for easy access for volunteers to information guidance and shared practice something that previous research by the childrens commissioner has also highlighted
3175289 we would like to see a one stop shop that advises and encourages adults who want to volunteer with young people in order to tackle the widespread uncertainty about insurance form filling and regulation
3175290 young people consistently tell us they want safe fun things to do and sport and other activities can really help to bridge the divide between generations so ensuring the right support is in place is crucial
3175291 the importance of children and young people enjoying their chosen sport whether its a kick about in the park an after school club or something more competitive is something that should be encouraged
3175292 the findings reveal that most adults can see how various measures like disclosure checks or child protection policies play a real part in keeping children safe
3175293 it is utterly ridiculous to label an industry which depends on the mass slaughter of wildlife for entertainment purposes as glorious
3175294 barbaric and immoral would be far more appropriate under these circumstances
3175295 the councils leadership and arrangements for managing its performance are effective and it recognises that there are areas of service delivery that need to further improve notably its planning function and educational attainment
3175296 the council is well placed to tackle this it works well as an organisation and with its community planning partners and is open clear and balanced in reporting its performance to the public
3175297 we look forward to receiving an improvement plan from the council including plans for implementing workforce planning completing employee reviews and developing a more robust approach to ensuring its services are best value this will build on the good work already being done by the council
3175298 we are determined to make perth and kinross council a flagship local authority for scotland and the accounts commission findings show that we have the vision the people and the commitment to achieve our aim
3175299 i welcome this very positive report it shows that we are delivering on our commitment to provide quality and improving services for the people of perth and kinross and we are already taking action in the areas we need to drive improvement forward
3175300 to learn that a pair of giant pandas may be used in this unethical manner reflects poorly on scotlands reputation and the scottish and uk governments
3175301 if edinburgh zoo really wishes to help giant pandas it should focus on supporting in situ conservation in chinese panda reserves along with preserving the animals natural habitat

3175322 the religious perception of heaven and hell came into japan

3175342 the evidence that humans caused the extinction of giant ice age mammals in australia by over hunting them is now much stronger
3175343 this study shows that alternative explanations to do with climate change or fire wont work in tasmania
3175344 it remains premature to claim a human role in the demise of the australian megafauna especially when humans cannot even be placed at the scene
3175345 tasmania has been a bit of a fly in the ointment for those who have argued that australias giant mammals were driven to extinction by humans the small amount of available evidence seemed to suggest the megafauna disappeared well before people reached the island
3175346 turney and colleagues now show that at least one and possibly as many as seven species did in fact survive until humans arrived
3175347 argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined
3175348 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today

3175462 hey i will make a strapping system to give the illusion of perky titties even though when she takes it off her nipples may knock her on the knees that is the wonder of the wonder bra
3175463 the statistics on sanity are that one out of every four persons is suffering from some sort of mental illness think of your three best friends if theyre okay then its you
3175464 we fill up a bathtub then we offer a teaspoon a teacup and a bucket to the patient and ask him or her to empty the bathtub
3175465 a normal person would use the bucket because its bigger than the spoon or the teacup
3175466 a normal person would pull the plug do you want a room with or without a view
3175467 twas great fun running through the isles picking out stuff for the kids trying to stick to the time constraints of a lunch break its the only time we have had without them to go get this done i even got the treat of lunch out with my old man even if it was only taco bell aka toxic hell
3175468 what words can president bush say to help grow his approval rating
3175469 make sure you buy two quilts for your bed so you always have one for you also ensure you keep an extra pillow or two on the floor beside the bed so that when he steals it during the night like a comfort klepto only to throw it onto the floor on his side of the bed you can reach down and get back to sleep without getting that insatiable urge to stick a spoon through his forehead as he sleeps
3175470 to my country i want to say this during this crisis you failed us
3175471 how many times did gov kathleen blanco have to say that the situation was desperate how many times did mayor ray nagin have to call for aid
3175472 there is something very peculiar about a city and a state that have a plan on the books for years that outlines what to do when a hurricane is about to strike yet when a hurricane comes roaring in the responsible officials just chuck the plan and try winging it delaying and then winging it in the face of a monstrous cat 4 5 hurricane is never ever a good idea especially for new orleans
3175473 you know what youre alright i really think youre pretty cool
3175474 i love you man i am gonna miss you so bad when you leave youre my best sniffle friend i have ever made in the air force

3175493 see daddy thats where that bad vader guy came from
3175494 i am in love with my husband and love my kids
3175495 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi bush said
3175496 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia bush said
3175497 to learn that a pair of giant pandas may be used in this unethical manner reflects poorly on scotlands reputation and the scottish and uk governments
3175498 if edinburgh zoo really wishes to help giant pandas it should focus on supporting in situ conservation in chinese panda reserves along with preserving the animals natural habitat
3175499 this woman was working alone within the office and we believe the attack occurred about two oclock in the afternoon
3175500 we are issuing a forensic artists impression of a man who was seen in new city road around the time of the attack and may hold vital information that could move this investigation forward
3175501 i would urge this man to come forward or any person who recognises him to contact the police
3175502 the southern ocean is a hotspot for climate research because its circulation is critical to understanding the earths climate and its huge ice sheet is sensitive to climate change
3175503 southern elephant seals are wide ranging predators that roam all over the southern ocean even under the sea ice in the wintertime a time when conventional ocean observation methods are unable to gather data
3175504 i think this is an extremely exciting new approach for ocean observation which has now been extended to seals roaming the seas around both poles
3175505 the meop animals have contributed over 35 000 observations from the polar seas in the past year and i think it is really fantastic to see how large a contribution the animals can make sending data from below the ice in near real time
3175506 it is utterly ridiculous to label an industry which depends on the mass slaughter of wildlife for entertainment purposes as glorious
3175507 barbaric and immoral would be far more appropriate under these circumstances
3175508 the councils leadership and arrangements for managing its performance are effective and it recognises that there are areas of service delivery that need to further improve notably its planning function and educational attainment
3175509 the council is well placed to tackle this it works well as an organisation and with its community planning partners and is open clear and balanced in reporting its performance to the public
3175510 we look forward to receiving an improvement plan from the council including plans for implementing workforce planning completing employee reviews and developing a more robust approach to ensuring its services are best value this will build on the good work already being done by the council
3175511 we are determined to make perth and kinross council a flagship local authority for scotland and the accounts commission findings show that we have the vision the people and the commitment to achieve our aim
3175512 i welcome this very positive report it shows that we are delivering on our commitment to provide quality and improving services for the people of perth and kinross and we are already taking action in the areas we need to drive improvement forward
3175513 it is heartening to see that sports volunteers support and understand the need for children protection measures
3175514 this report identifies the need for easy access for volunteers to information guidance and shared practice something that previous research by the childrens commissioner has also highlighted
3175515 we would like to see a one stop shop that advises and encourages adults who want to volunteer with young people in order to tackle the widespread uncertainty about insurance form filling and regulation
3175516 young people consistently tell us they want safe fun things to do and sport and other activities can really help to bridge the divide between generations so ensuring the right support is in place is crucial
3175517 the importance of children and young people enjoying their chosen sport whether its a kick about in the park an after school club or something more competitive is something that should be encouraged
3175518 the findings reveal that most adults can see how various measures like disclosure checks or child protection policies play a real part in keeping children safe
3175519 this one right here the one with the picture of the open lock on it
3175520 if i get confused and dont come back right away will you come help me

3175522 we are starting to roll out a fix now and hope to have the problem resolved as quickly as possible
3175523 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point
3175524 it was a fairly big stuff up by the guest and when she was asked why she did it she said she had no idea and she was upset and disappointed with herself she left next day
3175525 we were about 75 percent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes wilson said
3175526 following an incident at the hotel two cabin crew members were stood down pending an investigation the spokeswoman said replacement cabin crew subsequently operated the service
3175527 these are not naughty postcards from the beach they are undoubtedly porn pure and simple some of it is quite dark with animals committing fellatio and girl on girl action its quite unpleasant
3175528 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3175529 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3175530 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
3175531 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
3175532 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
3175533 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
3175534 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
3175535 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
3175536 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
3175537 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
3175538 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
3175539 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3175540 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3175541 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3175542 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
3175543 any director is automatically disqualified if convicted of one of a number of offences by a competent court anywhere in the world
3175544 if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature as always we will take advice from the home office and the foreign office
3175545 that there is a continuation of dictatorship in thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
3175546 going into tonights prelims i was just hoping to be 2 12 or better to make top 16
3175547 i wanted to get in the semifinals with the least amount of effort i have the 100 back and the 200 im double tomorrow and thats very difficult im embracing the challenge
3175548 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species
3175549 we are expecting a very long 18 months before any improvement
3175550 back then my wife had to work full time even though our daughter was very young
3175551 things started picking up in the second half of last year
3175552 farming has gone through a sorting out period over the last 10 years those who have survived will be doing better now higher prices are giving them encouragement
3175553 their costs be they fuel feed or fertilizer are going up much quicker than their prices
3175554 they are probably in some cases doing worse than they were two years ago
3175555 in this time when many important issues face our nation it is vital that we have representation in congress that can effectively lead on issues including energy independence and national security
3175556 it has come to our attention that there may have been some outside groups who sought to improperly influence the republican primary the republican voters of the first congressional district know that this congressional seat is too important to do anything but look at this very closely my campaign believes we should take an opportunity to explore all of the factual information and options
3175557 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
3175558 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
3175559 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
3175560 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
3175561 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
3175562 because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
3175563 our legal team are going to be exhausting every possible channel for holding the police accountable for the draconian use of stop and search measures for the things they confiscated and for their violent incursions on to the camp
3175564 every year police use the supposed existence of a hardcore minority as justification for their heavy handedness and every year this hardcore minority fails to materialise
3175565 la posibilidad existe y nery est muy ilusionado por ella el inter s es rec proco haremos todo lo que est en nuestra mano para concretar la oferta del betis
3175566 ninguna negociaci n es dif cil cuando se ofrecen soluciones l gicas y en este caso al club de origen se le da la oportunidad de ahorrarse un dinero importante con la f rmula de la cesi n aunque dejando abierta la posibilidad de la compra exigida por el betis
3175567 sabemos que tenemos que ceder la ficha de nery es importante pero despu s de las ltimas experiencias somos conscientes de que el aspecto deportivo est sobre el econ mico
3175568 those in the crowd were yelling hey white boys youre in the hood now
3175569 oh i reckon i believes in tea sunrises that sort of thing
3175570 substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3175571 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tiblisi
3175572 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3175573 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3175574 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
3175575 an immediate cease fire the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict a return to the military status quo as of aug 6 and a commitment to refrain from the use of force
3175576 russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3175577 due to his state of mind at the time there is a possibility that he did cross the centre line intentionally to take his own life and he did unfortunately take someone else with him
3175578 its really a tragic situation on both sides two families are grieving
3175579 at no point did we engage in a pursuit as far as lights and sirens we didnt want to escalate the situation
3175580 but we were in the process of trying to locate mr guliker and speak with him to deal with his own personal safety
3175581 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3175582 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3175583 yeah i never told anyone about this but i i liked your poems
3175584 we are currently experiencing groups mail processing delays we are working to isolate the cause of this issue and will post updates as we make progress
3175585 they have no alcohol here and since i stopped drinking i like that
3175586 we want to have a bus that runs on alcohol and urine its the gift that keeps on giving
3175587 but i like to think i was doing my part for the planet
3175588 its the least i could do since i recycle enough music already
3175589 any environmental effort is a good thing considering the example being set by the people in charge
3175590 he only said he would be willing to consider whether there were more responsible ways of doing it i want a leader who is willing to look at the facts and weigh both sides of something
3175591 all faculty are offered one more year for their children at the faculty tuition discount as a way to avoid disrupting their childrens lives too much
3175592 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3175593 i fantasize about having sex with two guys or having sex in public and lately about my pool contractor
3175594 men would always tell me oh youre so beautiful you have such a great body you could be doing movies
3175595 i was sure i could too but i just didnt want to but now that im a little older a little more mature and a little more divorced im ready to try some new things im proud of my body i spend a lot of time and energy making it look good and now im readyto share it i hpe you guys like what you see
3175596 we want to make sure that people who have a history of violent or previous offending or sexual offenders are properly monitored
3175597 this was an honest mistake on my part and i take full responsibility for it
3175598 this is in no way should reflect badly on either the city of elgin or the chicago bandits ballclub they are both outstanding organizations i have enjoyed serving the city as a councilman and will miss doing the job
3175599 i think its a sad situations for the city to have that happen
3175600 he brought a fresh outlook as to how the city markets itself
3175601 mike has done a very good job for the city of elgin and has been a big reason why we moved to the city
3175602 the abstraction of the state as such belongs only to modern times the abstraction of the political state is a modern product
3175603 a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie
3175604 helping local authorities to obtain access to the euro dollar market
3175605 the interest on securities issued by a local authority in the currency of a country outside the scheduled territories shall be payable in full without deduction of tax at source and be exempt from income tax where the beneficial owner of the securities is not resident in the uk
3175606 means of removing an impediment to foreign currency borrowing by uk authorities in the eurobond market
3175607 it was in the public interest for nationalised industries and large local authorities to borrow on the euro dollar market
3175608 modern governments overestimated their ability to shape and manage the complex drives of a mature economy they wrongly assumed that they understood all the reasons for its shortcomings and so not surprisingly were all too ready to lay hands on superficial remedies for overcoming them and all this without any attempt to understand the economies of an increasingly interdependent world
3175609 barack obama is committed to bringing change we can believe in to florida to such a degree that we are assembling the largest campaign team in the history of this state my fellow north floridians are ready for change and its our job to debunk the false myths that have spread and introduce the real barack obama
3175610 senator obama is a true patriot a good christian man who believes that parents need to take more responsibility for their children he will provide the kind of leadership we need to get our country back on track
3175611 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
3175612 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
3175613 higher and higher in the tree the valves are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
3175614 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
3175615 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
3175616 and thats what we see at the tops of very tall trees the foliage is struggling to get enough water and seems to be under drought stress its not unusual to see periodic die back at the tops of very tall douglas fir trees that are near their height limits

3175654 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
3175655 at first glance some water companies such as dwr cymru welsh water wessex water severn trent water and yorkshire water seem to have taken this to heart and said that they can continue to meet their obligations to deliver a safe reliable service provide further benefits to consumers and do this without raising prices much above the rate of inflation if at all
3175656 other water companies such as southern water sutton and east surrey bristol water south east water folkestone and dover and cambridge water have proposed bill increases of over 20 per cent above the rate of inflation
3175657 the consumer council for water believes that many customers will be concerned with price rises on this scale especially in light of other household bill increases customers will want to see the justification for any proposed price increases to understand exactly what they will get for the extra money
3175658 if you look at the huge cost of setting up an infrastructure to accommodate full scale mining then it is still better to buy than build
3175659 it can all be summed up in one word china our estimate is that the economy will continue to grow at around 15 per cent a year until 2015 it is going to acquire enormous amounts of steel copper and aluminium
3175660 two billion people are entering the industrial age it is like rebuilding europe after the second world war but on an even bigger scale
3175661 the china story is the story of the mining sector no one expected chinas growth to continue at this rate people have said it is the top of the cycle since the growth first started five years ago there is nothing very new in what is happening at the moment the mining industry has always grown by acquisition it is very rare to see a mining company go from buying mineral rights to production life is just too short to rely on your own exploration although some companies have been successful at it but i expect the larger companies to carry on as they are taking out other large companies to gain control of their assets
3175662 last november we said that we would explore the possible sale of some or all of the us coal assets of rio tinto energy america as part of a group wide divestment programme both options are being explored in the interests of maximising shareholder value
3175663 rio tintos announcement is a clever move in our view it would raise capital and highlight the value of this business
3175664 if you put on your bearish hat it could also signal the fact that rio tinto is struggling to sell this division we dont think that this is the case though it is just a question of price we suspect
3175665 we are extremely concerned to hear about goods shrinking in size without shrinking in price as it cheats unsuspecting shoppers already under financial pressure from rising household and motoring costs in america it is known as the grocery shrink ray and this is one trend from the us that we definitely dont want too much of over here
3175666 we seek to keep our confectionery affordable in order to offer our consumers value for money and therefore we have slightly reduced the size on some of the larger sharing packs rather than directly raising prices
3175667 the decision to introduce a new 15 can pack of strongbow was brought about by our need to raise wholesale prices in face of the widespread and unprecedented rise in business costs and retailers desire to continue to offer strongbow in a similar party pack format at the same price point had retailers not chosen to go down this route they would have had to pass on a hefty price increase to purchasers of the old 18 can pack and they clearly feel no price increase on a smaller pack offers better consumer value
3175668 we have reduced our mince pack size slightly however we have absorbed a significant amount of the farm gate price increase
3175669 even in a credit crunch most customers are savvy enough to see these tactics as underhand companies should realise that once caught out their corporate reputation could suffer and customers always have the power to switch brands
3175670 frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3175671 without exception all the retailers i am talking to are not optimistic at all
3175672 following a weak set of second quarter results we believe bid support may drop away should the sale of bskybs stake be deemed unnecessary by the cat competition appeals tribunal or delayed

3175674 recent deals consolidate cobhams status as a tier two player but in our view undermine its attractions as a take out candidate
3175675 the potential reward for owning these stocks is a possible re rating to a price tangible book ratio of 1 after taking into account possible write downs
3175676 debenhams flat at 53p woolworths up 0 46p at 7 36p and m amp s were all the rage last week in terms of bid rumours but none of these look particularly attractive to us

3175724 before i started writing this book i hoped to write the biography of every single thing in maqiao id been writing fiction for ten or so years but i liked reading and writing fiction less and less i am of course referring to the traditional kind of fiction which has a very strong sense of plot main character main plot main mood block out all else dominating the field of vision of both reader and writer preventing any sidelong glances any occasional casual digression is no more than a fragmentary embellishment of the main line the temporary amnesty of a tyrant
3175725 the rat a tat tat of the machine gun hidden on a roof somewhere suddenly went off a sudden noise it was that would have sounded very foreign very distant to its hearers the rain of bullets whistled over rolled up into a whirlwind none felt the bullets passing through his flesh but as clouds of dust leapt up from the mud slope behind them and sand splattered in all directions it became very obvious that something had exploded through one side of their bodies before blossoming out into a whole chain of dust cloud blooms on the other side maybe they were just beginning to understand what kind of a thing metal is what kind of a thing speed is how freely and easily metal bullets passed through flesh and how hard this instant was to grasp and finally they fell one after another into the hole in the ground they themselves had just dug
3175726 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3175727 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3175728 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3175729 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3175730 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3175731 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3175732 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3175733 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3175734 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3175735 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3175736 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3175737 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3175738 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3175739 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3175740 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3175741 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3175742 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3175743 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3175744 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3175745 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3175746 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3175747 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3175748 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3175749 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3175750 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3175751 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3175752 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

3175754 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the foreign affairs ministry
3175755 several government websites have gone down since the hacker attacks began on friday
3175756 on the contrary a number of internet sites belonging to the russian media and official organizations have fallen victim to concerted hacker attacks
3175757 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3175758 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3175759 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3175760 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3175761 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3175762 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3175763 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3175764 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3175765 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3175766 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3175767 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3175768 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3175769 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3175770 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3175771 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3175772 hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3175773 i can confirm that alcohol was involved in the incident
3175774 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3175775 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3175776 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3175777 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3175778 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3175779 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3175780 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3175781 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3175782 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3175784 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3175785 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3175786 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3175787 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3175788 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3175789 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3175790 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3175791 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3175792 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3175793 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3175794 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3175795 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3175796 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3175797 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3175798 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3175799 program which has the overall goal of landing astronauts on the moon by 2020 lockheed martin corp which is developing the orion spacecraft and united technologies corp company which are working on new rockets

3175801 i would like to put out a release documenting all the instances that we know obama has been contemplating a potus run
3175802 were sorry but we cant show you this if youre not from america
3175803 are you ready to catch olympic fever actually it doesnt have to be the olympics for you catch it seriously stay away from their pigs and birds
3175804 mist haze and smog though its hard to tell which is which
3175805 mr musharraf is going to fight these charges on a moral ground to try to disprove them but when it comes to the numbers i think hes lost it
3175806 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the 1bn a year the americans have been giving for the armed forces the army has been getting between the range of 250m to 300m 125m to 150m reimbursement for what they do but where is the rest of the money
3175807 absolutely president musharraf will prove all this wrong there is no way he will quit now quietly while being blamed for corruption
3175808 negotiations are going on for a safe exit to be given to him general kayani will be meeting mr musharraf later this evening
3175809 shahbaz sharif mr sharifs younger brother is acting as the interlocutor for the coalition i think the americans and the army are demanding he be given safe passage impeachment would mean a huge distraction from the war on terror
3175810 your account is temporarily unavailable due to site maintenance it should be available again within a few hours we apologize for the inconvenience
3175811 the whole conflict is not being waged over the pipeline the reasons are definitely geopolitical
3175812 however the russians know the pipeline is important to georgia and may try to damage it they have the capability to do so
3175813 this shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets
3175814 for europeans an alternative supply route is psychological reassurance its having a route that does not go through russia
3175815 but the other countries the pipeline passes through may ultimately prove more unreliable
3175816 and please make your position and speak with one united voice
3175817 i like your articles but the independent had a footnote the other day saying that stalin divided north and south ossetia its not true south ossetia has always been georgian
3175818 i think the store wars are silly to be honest with you im sure shes a lovely girl she seems really nice i think it was silly the whole megan gale versus jen thing i dont buy into it
3175819 i think the store wars are silly to be honest with you
3175820 dicko and i are always waiting for that call youre sacked or you have to lose weight
3175821 hes really excited about the current series but the truth is unless i worked for fremantle i just couldnt say what the future holds
3175822 it is frustrating because obviously just two weeks out i had to fit this into my schedule
3175823 i would like to think that im going to be missed but who knows
3175824 fortunately im still a part of the channel 7 family and can focus on my own show for the rest of the year
3175825 the writer never turned up for his press conference he apparently got lost in his car as lost presumably as his film both he and the movie come from another planet
3175826 i didnt blow anything and so i can go home happy with my performance
3175827 but unfortunately its a partnership you both have to be on the top of your game i wasnt on the top of my game but tom was nowhere near the top of his
3175828 i knew we were capable of a medal but i knew it would depend on how tom performed i out dived thomas today and thats not something that normally happens and that to me is because tom had a lot more pressure on him than i did tom was very nervous more so than ever before and i think he really struggled to get through the competition
3175829 peking tom why everyones looking at this 14 year old darling diver
3175830 i think thats the sole reason why it went the way it did
3175831 i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone
3175832 that is thomas over nervous that is how it was today today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3175833 i was quite disappointed but it was a great experience and i really enjoyed myself i had so much fun out there thats all you can ask getting the experience
3175834 we should start 2009 by calling a referendum on whether to approve the states new constitution policy
3175835 if we cant reach substantive agreements then we must address all those issues which divide us to a referendum issues like re election the compatibility of autonomous governments land issues
3175836 i was working really hard and doing the program right and it wasnt working like it was meant to
3175837 it was stressing me out because i was meant to be losing weight and everyones looking at me and its all bad
3175838 i went to the doctor and my body doesnt digest certain foods well so i decided it was bad for them and i didnt want to do bad by them
3175839 people for some reason think i dont like women that are overweight sandilands said
3175840 but i want everyone to be the best they can be and if theyre fat then i say to them then they should lose weight
3175841 im fat myself i have to lose weight but every sunday i tell myself i should and ill start on monday but i dont
3175842 every year they come in and they say were used to performing with a band and an audience and this is a very different experience for us
3175843 so weve given them a band this year and a full audience so they s t their pants when they walk in with their band and their audience and they have to sing boom straight away
3175844 weve reacted to what the contestants have been whingeing about for a few years
3175845 its a much better idea than having a big band night who gives a s t about that id rather have a kelly rowland night or beyonce night or something a little bit fresh sandilands said
3175846 ive been talking about mentors for years im not talking your kate ceberanos im talking your big international stars like big international guests
3175847 you couldnt really get your teeth into any particular issue because there wasnt enough time
3175848 im a bit more open to something new and different and he isnt
3175849 if he cant relate to someone thats already been a musical success he cant really see where they fit
3175850 hes used to cloning artists whereas im for individuality something fresh and new
3175851 putins high profile appears to show the outside world that medvedev is a ceremonial president putin is the dominant player
3175852 destroy your own stock market and wipe off 60 billion
3175853 it is clear what is happening we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war
3175854 all the russian troops who arrived by ship have crossed over to zugdidi
3175855 the city is deserted but there are no russians here
3175856 its not south ossetia only but the whole of georgia
3175857 we heard statements saying that the russian railroad troops that entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there for a humanitarian mission now we know the truth that these forces were there to rebuild the railway to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a russian invasion
3175858 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3175859 whose suffering and courage in a hanoi prison camp is an american legend
3175860 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way
3175861 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralise this country and help create a socialist america
3175862 i was caught up in the hysteria during the vietnam era which was brought about through marxist propaganda underlying the so called peace movement
3175863 the radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2 5 million people in cambodia and south vietnam did they stop the war or did they bring the war to those innocent people in the end they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away
3175864 if mr obama had his way he would have pulled our troops from iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies
3175865 there is not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb
3175866 if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way
3175867 its only natural that industry based obama supporters will henceforth regard him askance
3175868 reading voights op ed piece these many years later i realise how right he was
3175869 its out of line to insinuate that we should blacklist people for speaking their minds
3175870 its a strange thing when people in this country cant express their opinions without being attacked
3175871 slept with too many women done too many drugs and been to too many parties
3175872 the ongoing tightening of bank credit standards and the further weakening in demand for bank loans strengthens our belief that the euro zone credit cycle is turning sharply lower
3175873 the money markets have ceased to function as they should as nothing has been resolved with regards to the lack of trust between banks
3175874 this is why youre seeing such demand for central bank money 12 months on from the start of the crunch these measures were only supposed to be temporary and theyre looking increasingly permanent
3175875 ethics is how we behave when we decide we belong together
3175876 fell short of the categorical retraction of the imputation of anti semitism that i insisted upon
3175877 nunca hab a visto algo as en toda mi carrera de software

3175891 c mo puede us a negar lo que dios mismo ha declarado

3175896 not a great finale though and it wasnt just the silly pirates of the caribbean like contraption ben used to move the island or the fact that those eight people survived a helicopter crash that no one could have survived
3175897 i will take this opportunity to apologize because i think i was verging on disrespectful with you and i dont think you deserve that
3175898 the archuletta kid will be on broadway in four years
3175899 not all talented people are discovered but all he is is a good singer im sorry but there is not an ounce of originallity in his body i guess hes talented at being sneaky and talented at not being caught but as it was proven time and time again all of his arrangements that were praised for being so clever and creative were copies of other covers

3175902 every time i see or hear archuleta i want to strangle on a night that lacked a single memorable moment for the remaining five finalists partly because the source material blows we did at least get
3175903 i feel like youre not fighting hard enough to get to the top four

3175919 we have one new series that might be greenlit soon and theres seven new shorts greenlit for production weve taken one hundred pitches for other shorts and approved twenty five boards for development in the shorts program
3175920 meanwhile the israeli trainers are trying to glean from reports on the movements of the georgian army whether their trainees have internalized israeli military technique
3175921 our second quarter sequential revenue growth of 20 significantly exceeded our previously stated guidance of 15 for the quarter
3175922 these strong results reflect the continued maturation of both our newer markets and our sales force over the past 12 months we have significantly increased the number of account executives and the customer pipelines developed by our expanded sales force is beginning to yield results our internet based marketing initiatives and the success of our mid range product offering of 8 mbps at 999 per month are also driving sales growth
3175923 we are well positioned to take advantage of the significant investment made over the past 12 months in our network and in our people
3175924 we have strengthened our network capabilities in existing markets and established a strong network presence in our new markets we have built and trained a sales force which is almost three times larger than a year ago and our newer account executives are beginning to report higher sales volume with these investments largely completed and our sales growth accelerating we believe that our cash burn may have peaked in the first quarter of 2008
3175925 recent customer wins include high profile companies such as intel netflix and espn and our existing customers continue to upgrade to higher bandwidth products increasing arpu
3175926 at the same time churn decreased to 1 17 reflecting higher levels of customer satisfaction these positive operating metrics are a clear indication that businesses view internet connectivity as essential to their operations even during a difficult economic environment
3175927 people have always been fascinated by how some trees such as douglas fir or redwoods can grow so tall
3175928 this is not an easy thing to do think about trying to drink water through a narrow 350 foot long straw it takes a lot of suction
3175929 higher and higher in the tree the valves are able to withstand more pulling force from the long heavy column of water before air bubbles can be sucked through
3175930 but the problem is that the valves become less efficient at letting water pass the height at which no water would pass at all according to our models coincides the tallest records for douglas fir about 350 to 400 feet
3175931 as you go higher and higher in a douglas fir tree its almost like experiencing a drought
3175932 and thats what we see at the tops of very tall trees the foliage is struggling to get enough water and seems to be under drought stress its not unusual to see periodic die back at the tops of very tall douglas fir trees that are near their height limits
3175933 we are pleased a solution between migenix and djohnson has been reached as a result of a detailed assessment of migenixs current financial condition the opportunities which lie ahead and the standby commitment for a rights offering that has been made by djohnson the board determined that a settlement with djohnson was in the best interests of shareholders
3175934 i am glad the impending proxy battle has been resolved i am pleased to have myself bruce schmidt and andrew rae join the board of directors to help guide migenix in realizing its objectives our agreement with migenix increases shareholder representation on our board and is consistent with our commitment of accountability to shareholders
3175935 we are committed to raising funds for migenix in a manner that is fair to all shareholders our proposal is to conduct a rights offering in the aggregate amount of 2 500 000 in which migenixs shareholders can participate the rights offering will have the dual benefit of raising the funds migenix requires while at the same time preventing further dilution of shareholders investment in migenix
3175936 youre a flirt you flirted with me on several occasions im not complaining
3175937 i was in the high school play therefore i think i have talent
3175938 just wondering why wcnc felt the need to insult our intelligence by telling us how to protect ourselves
3175939 please not that it was stated that the hickory station did not even devote as much time to this as the charlotte stations
3175940 why such a large city such as charlotte is so far from a government warning radar is frankly incomprehensible
3175941 the nws greer office uses the charlotte douglas terminal radar as well this helps supplement the distance problem over some of the charlotte area it has been used multiple times by the greer nws during severe weather outbreaks dont believe me e mail them and ask charlotte is covered adequately between the greer radar the charlotte airport radar and the columbia radar
3175942 i dont have to email gsp i know they make use of the the clt tdwr and i know they are aware of the limitations it has
3175943 the global distribution of the highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza has caused the world health organization to show its profound concern regarding the possibility of the virus spreading from human to human in the future
3175944 furthermore the development of resistance to two approved anti influenza drugs oseltamivir tamiflu r and zanamivir relenza r as well as the lack of adequate vaccines has increased the need of developing new antiviral drugs
3175945 consequently i am delighted to be involved in the preclinical research stage of this innovative antiviral candidate and look forward to continuing our successful collaboration with canopus biopharma in this area
3175946 it is possible that higher doses of statin than those used in this study may result in even greater efficacy statc tm also appeared to be more effective when administered preventatively
3175947 we are also motivated at the potential of this compound in comparison with other currently available anti influenza medications its clear that there is significant global need for a superior low cost and plentiful alternative in the fight against influenza
3175948 as executive officer of the cpsc i watched for nearly 5 years as this proposed standard was reviewed and debated even under normal circumstances this standard is perhaps a year or more away from being approved and that does not factor in a new administration in washington
3175949 this could potentially leave california open to having no standard or a weaker standard than the one currently being used
3175950 the proposed changes to ab 706 would undoubtedly put californians at risk as the legislation threatens to lessen the existing fire safety standard
3175951 why ignore the flammability test requirements that have kept californians safe and manufacturers accountable the proposed amendment fails to recognize the importance of testing foam cushions and filing consistently the most flammable components of upholstered furniture clearly the newest version of ab 706 can cause real problems for the citizens of california
3175952 while working through these difficult market conditions in the first half of the year we focused our efforts on fixed and variable cost reduction and the successful implementation of lean principles throughout the entire organization as we position the company for uncertain economic conditions for the remainder of the year we also improved our balance sheet by paying down a significant portion of our borrowings and raising equity in a private placement and a rights offering
3175953 moving into the second half of the year we plan to mitigate the slowness in the rv and mh industries through continued focus on cost containment continuous improvement and lean operating initiatives at all levels of the organization to maximize our improved market position gained from the adorn acquisition
3175954 when we first purchased adorn llc we felt this was a transformational event for both companies and the first important step in patrick industries inc becoming the premier manufacturer and distributor of building and component products to the rv and mh industries and we are pleased with our progress so far
3175955 since the acquisition in may 2007 we have closed and consolidated ten operations and two operating cells and reduced our headcount by 640 including 70 salaried positions we continue to see significant synergies from the acquisition and estimate our annualized cost savings in 2008 to be more than 3 million during the first half of 2008 we estimate we have already realized approximately 1 5 million in combined annualized cost savings from the integration
3175956 with our leaner combined operations stronger management team and improving balance sheet we have repositioned patrick over the first six months of 2008 to compete in the currently difficult rv and mh markets we are also in a better position to execute our long term strategic plan based on market penetration enhanced capacity utilization improving operating efficiencies product development and strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities
3175957 i try to run three or four days a week
3175958 when i get my checkups every year usually my blood pressure is low and my health is very good
3175959 i think that all wrapped up into one will definitely increase your life expectancy
3175960 high blood sugar would affect your eyes and that if theres any change in your vision it could have something to do with the diabetes
3175961 because if they can survive all the other things with diabetes they will lose their vision
3175962 we have the nutritionists we have certified diabetes educators we have social workers
3175963 if we intervene early and have people individuals that have diabetes get screened early and intervene early than we can prevent the progression of the disease and prevent blindness
3175964 if i have any questions i can call and they have been great really great so im very pleased to come here
3175965 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3175966 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia
3175967 senaki is one of the places where such actions were under way
3175968 it wasnt for them about south ossetia its about controlling energy routes
3175969 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3175970 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3175971 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3175972 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict and that of course includes the georgian side
3175973 the pipeline is partly owned by bp and supplies up to a million barrels of crude oil per day into europe if damaged it could have a knock on effect and result in some disruption to the european oil market
3175974 the fighting has put further strain on russias relationship with the west and marks a potentially serious downturn
3175975 i think the pipeline matters but i dont think it matters that much it has been attacked plenty of times before
3175976 i can give you a list of them right now
3175977 myth history and inspiration a review article of inspiration and incarnation by peter enns
3175978 ben collett and his family are happy this case has finally come to a close and that ben is able to move on to the next chapter in his life
3175979 the size of the award reflects his talent and potential prior to the tackle as one of the brightest young footballers in the country
3175980 having said that ben would understandably have preferred to earn this sum through a full career as a professional footballer
3175981 the judgment announced today is the highest award ever given to a professional sportsman or sportswoman
3175982 the boy showed fantastic focus and a great attitude to work hard they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3175983 in the course of the game he was tackled by the first defendant gary smith
3175984 the tackle was high and as a consequence the claimant suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula of his right leg
3175985 at the time he sustained his injury he was on course for a successful career in professional football
3175986 must have had a good chance of spending at least part of his career possibly the majority in the premier league
3175987 his positive attitude towards his injury and to the devastating blow of being unable to pursue his chosen career does him great credit i found him a most impressive young man
3175988 i must apologise again for deciding to come to live in england if i am fortunate enough i will return and die on thai soil just like other thais
3175989 the party is independent thaksins presence or absence doesnt have any sway on its direction
3175990 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3175991 such remarks by the former leader could damage the countrys image in its suggestion that we have an unjust judicial system
3175992 thailand remains a good country with a great amount of justice
3175993 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3175994 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3175995 the only language that bullies understand is when someone stands up to them
3175996 this is not an occasion for megaphone diplomacy russias behaviour is disproportionate and unacceptable but the only way to bring stability back to the region is through diplomatic means
3175997 the first minister took the opportunity to have a private meeting with the russian ambassador to make that clear
3175998 the ambassador pledged to communicate that message to the russian government
3175999 russia is trying to send the strongest signal it can that it will not countenance further meddling as it sees it in its affairs
3176000 this is one of the only growing oil markets in the world and it is such a dangerous cocktail mix of politics economics and strategic interests that frankly the health and wellbeing of the civilians of south ossetia is nothing to do with it
3176001 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3176002 we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe this war has pushed georgia further away from europe
3176003 everything has to be up for consideration as part of the review
3176004 i feel confident that i have made the right decisions in the situation i was in the range of options i have i dont feel i have anything to fear from the review
3176005 now those issues have been resolved ill be out seeing more shows
3176006 i think its an opportune moment to re examine what the fringe society and fringe need to do so that the fringe continues to flourish
3176007 full and frank he added the fringe have taken on board the fact they have got to do a full review
3176008 people are slightly bewildered and angry that things were allowed to get as bad as they did
3176009 there are numerous things that can be looked at expertise size quite simply how any organisation copes with what the fringe has to cope with
3176010 i would be more concerned if he had seen 200 shows or 20 his job is to be in there fixing the problems
3176011 that doesnt surprise me i havent found it easy to get out
3176012 he took a young life because he was bored the least i would have expected would have been for him to have served time i just think it is a joke it is terrible it is bloody awful if they think that is the price of a life in this country
3176013 theres no other criminal law in the land where the consequences of the action are not taken into account
3176014 it is so hard to sit beside the parents in a court case you try to prepare them for the fact that the death cannot be taken into account but its still a shattering experience thankfully this loophole will no longer exist
3176015 it was coming towards me too fast and i saw it cross over on to the side of the road i was on
3176016 i swerved to miss i pulled the car to the left and then back to the right i lost control of the car and it went over the embankment
3176017 like a lot of young people you were just going as fast as you could
3176018 cutting it isnt too dangerous but you do have to be careful
3176019 the practice of sending yew cuttings to drug companies is quite well established and has been going on for around ten to 15 years
3176020 traditionally the wood which is absolutely beautiful and very hard with a wonderful grain was used for furniture or even bagpipes it is also regarded as a symbol of longevity and was often planted in graveyards
3176021 it is the most active vegetable poison known in the world for in a small dose it immediately induces death without any previous disorder and its deleterious power seems to act upon the nervous system without exciting the least inflammation in the part to which it more immediately enters
3176022 i may have got what is close to an apology but they still dont admit culpability
3176023 i am going to fight them all the way to get them to admit an error was made the health board told my solicitor that there was no evidence of individual incompetence or negligence and that they had no case to answer and that was it
3176024 i want them to admit something went wrong and to explain why
3176025 the clinical course of action agreed for mr ball was arrived at following the review of all relevant information test results scans x rays etc by a multi disciplinary group of clinicians
3176026 it was considered to be the appropriate action based on all this information
3176027 nhs grampian deeply regrets that with hindsight the procedure that mr ball underwent may not have been necessary
3176028 mr balls case notes have been reviewed we understand that he is pursuing a legal claim and has expressed a view that he has a right to expect a full explanation from nhs grampian
3176029 we intend making urgent contact with mr ball to offer him a face to face meeting to review the clinical circumstances of his care without prejudice to any legal action he chooses to pursue
3176030 extensive investigations have been ongoing since this incident to trace the person responsible
3176031 this woman was working alone within the office and we believe the attack occurred at about 2pm that wednesday afternoon
3176032 we are issuing a forensic artists impression of a man who was seen in new city road around the time of the attack and may hold vital information that could move this investigation forward
3176033 i would urge this man to come forward and speak to officers or any person who recognises him to contact us
3176034 it is simply na ve to believe this kind of shortfall will not impact on front line policing or recruitment strathclyde faces a deeply damaging and immediate threat to essential recruitment plans
3176035 unless the scottish government accepts immediate responsibility for this shortfall strathclyde has no choice but to consider cash saving options from budgets which have already been slashed
3176036 the last thing we want is a freeze on police recruitment unfortunately the impact of this financial crisis means it must be considered
3176037 the subject of ongoing correspondence between the scottish government and the uk government and were discussed at the 31 july meeting between ministers cosla the local authorities body acpos the police chiefs association and the police conveners forum
3176038 to get a medal in the olympics im overwhelmed im so pleased its fantastic we have come so far
3176039 when i saw her touch the pool wall i think in all honesty that was the confirmation i wasnt sure if she had got it until that moment and then i hit the roof
3176040 she said she was just going to have fun with it and warm up for the 800m and see what she could do
3176041 my race was very tight we had the same time but i was at one end of the spectrum and he was at the other
3176042 even with the same time there could be four inches between first and second
3176043 sport is as much psychological as it is physical you have to have the ability but if you havent got the mental strength that could be the difference between winning and losing
3176044 the problem with technology special suits or equipment is most of the opposition has the same stuff you have to be in the zone psychologically you need the right people around you to make you perform
3176045 there was a little incident but it is an olympic games you are in a different world and people are going to do things differently
3176046 he had a pop at me before the last dive i saw my mum in the audience and asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do
3176047 thats just thomas hes over nervous thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is the sole reason why he didnt perform
3176048 we were out of character tom was nervous and thats what happens certainly not so much for me im a little bit older so i can take things on the chin a bit easier
3176049 when you are nervous you are in a different environment and things change and we both did things differently we tried to stick to our routine unfortunately it didnt come together on the day
3176050 i really enjoyed myself and had so much fun that is all you can ask for getting the experience of it
3176051 we prepared like a normal competition and we treated it like a normal competition it just wasnt our day today we put 100 per cent effort into every dive we just didnt pull it off
3176052 i think its quite exciting to imagine these animals swimming around down there and getting this data that helps us understand the weather and the climate
3176053 the southern ocean is a hot spot for climate research because its circulation is critical to under standing the earths climate and its huge ice sheet is sensitive to climate change
3176054 southern elephant seals are wide ranging predators that roam all over the southern ocean even under the sea ice in the wintertime a time when conventional ocean observation methods are unable to gather data
3176055 the idea that these animals have become our partners in providing real time data about the state of our climate while helping us to understand their ecological requirements has captured the imagination of biologists oceanographers and the public
3176056 southern ocean frontal structure and sea ice formation rates revealed by elephant seals
3176057 this case carries inevitably a prison sentence no doubt about it i am going to grant him bail but it must be on the clear understanding what the sentence will be
3176058 there was a long protracted series of text messages that culminated in the offence it is a series of messages followed by a series of threats
3176059 he is a young man of hitherto good character hes a young man who has led a blameless life
3176060 if we are training additional teachers and local authorities say they dont have enough money to employ them class sizes will not be reduced some local authorities have already admitted their class sizes wont be falling any time soon
3176061 the issue is probably going to drag on for a few weeks yet and it seems to be a lot worse than it has been for some time
3176062 there have been more teachers getting trained to bring down class sizes and to fill the posts of people who have retired but obviously somethings gone wrong somewhere
3176063 someone has got their sums wrong or there is posturing between the scottish government and councils
3176064 it does seem to be considerably worse than in previous years
3176065 it will be interesting to see what the national picture is when everyone goes back to school next week
3176066 it makes absolutely no sense to spend a considerable amount of time and money to train teachers if they cannot find posts
3176067 it was horrible to do it to another actor but to do it to your elder brother in his one man show im going to suffer
3176068 there are tax breaks for film productions in countries like ireland and they seem to work there so i dont see why they wouldnt work in scotland as well tax incentives would make it much more attractive for film companies to shoot in the highlands and islands
3176069 i have been involved in a few scottish productions shot in other countries because it was cheaper when i wish they could have been shot here
3176070 i will do anything i can to support the work of promoting film and television production in my home area
3176071 i want film companies to know that not only are there great places to film here but also that there is an infrastructure of accommodation and facilities to support large film productions with crews of up to 300 people
3176072 if we can bring films to the highlands and islands we will reap the economic benefits and there is the bonus of putting the area on the map thats how you achieve things like the harry potter tourist trail in lochaber
3176073 i would love to film again in moray i am trying to find scripts to shoot here maybe a new film of macbeth
3176074 kevin may be based in los angeles but he is passionate about scotland and his home patch in particular
3176075 the prime minister expressed his hope that this visit will open a new page in the relations between the two countries and strengthen security and stability in iraq and the entire region
3176076 a shopper may choose the microwave with more buttons because it seems
3176077 the task ive said is to solve incredibly complex problems and make their resolution appear inevitable and incredibly simple so you have no sense of how difficult this thing was
3176078 there was a bomb this morning just outside the city centre so i thought time was up
3176079 tbilisi is a vibrant exciting happy city it has clearly changed it has undergone a metamorphosis in the past eight years economically and socially but in the past five to six days it has turned into a ghost town
3176080 people have been conscripted or have decided to move out to the villages where they think there is less of a threat of being bombed
3176081 hee haw and rfd tv is a match made in heaven
3176082 wed always just hang out watch movies and smoke cigarettes
3176083 my girlfriend was really square and really hot and her boyfriend was really square and really hot so there was them and then us two total scumbags
3176084 it said south king county surf band needs rhythm guitar player call jesse and i thought you know the only guy with enough balls in south king county to have a surf band would be jesse
3176085 i just met jesse and said hey you guys are great i just bought your record
3176086 and he just shook his head like he totally disapproved which i took as a bad sign i went home and listened to it and immediately agreed
3176087 jesse told me that we were supposed to go meet with this label and im like really
3176088 he got you to drop too huh i knew he didnt have it
3176089 you play by your rules and ill play by my rules

3176092 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3176093 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3176094 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3176095 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3176096 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humor they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3176097 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3176098 i think its important to show what kids really use
3176099 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3176100 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3176101 its not just the short term impact on children and their families its the long term impact on the reputation of the city and the willingness of people to come and live and work here if the education they are getting turns out to be the worst in scotland
3176102 the council has got itself into a financial mess but the one thing it ought not to do is to sort it at the expense of schools and children
3176103 at approximately 2 30 this morning police were called to a report of a disturbance outside bamboo nightclub
3176104 a 23 year old male was the victim of a minor assault as a result two men aged 18 and 19 were arrested and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal
3176105 a 21 year old man was also arrested for a breach of the peace he was issued with a fixed penalty notice and later released
3176106 russell would not have wanted this to be a sad or over solemn occasion yet we are all left still with a sense of shock at his sudden departure
3176107 he was a man of values principles and ethics who made a great contribution to the advancement of civil liberties and human rights
3176108 we dont know how it got there we cant s
3176109 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators

3176115 major sequeira has not benefited from any formal training or accreditation in the management of searching for missing persons the search officers with the exception of the search and rescue team from lisbon had not benefited from any formal training in search procedures
3176116 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3176117 i dont like the way its scouring the network it just doesnt look like a well behaved network device sorry to be a computer nazi about this but can you disconnect it
3176118 knowledge of the enemys dispositions can only be obtained from other men hence the use of spies without subtle ingenuity of mind one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports
3176119 the game is a lackluster boring effort characterized by stingy defensive soccer
3176120 sounds like they like to whine a lot i cant stand people who break rules and then want comfort for their actions every action has a reaction
3176121 this band is like jason from the friday the 13th movies
3176122 we get killed every which way in every movie but we just wont die ten years ago i did an internet search on our band and i only found one link one we were a forgotten band
3176123 this is probably the biggest show weve ever done as rigor mortis

3176125 it was too hard to turn around the titanic so they just threw everybody overboard without life jackets
3176126 i could eat a couple of those street dogs every day have you tried the garlic fries
3176127 they figure out that they have to call in advance though those things take a long long time to cook
3176128 one interesting part of the story that maybe you havent gotten yet is that i really did try to get it published i finished the book five or six times it became almost a manic depressive practice where i would change it quite a bit and it got better each time
3176129 i saw selden on and off over the whole 30 years
3176130 and you know when someone tells you they are writing a book well a lot of people say they are writing a book so you wait to see what will come of it
3176131 one interesting part of the story that maybe you havent gotten yet is that i really did try to get it published i finished the book five or six times it became almost a manic depressive practice where i would change it quite a bit and it got better each time for instance there was a five year stretch where i worked on a version that eliminated the time travel but it came back i will tell you this though as hard as the rejection was i am glad now that i did not publish the first draft
3176132 when i did read it i was on the verge of tears the whole time
3176133 i just kept looking up at his name which is at the top of every page and thinking that this is incredible he was always really working and he was making something so complex and beautiful that it took that whole time
3176134 there was this sense of familiarity as though what he had written was a shared history
3176135 i liked the erudition and hearing about all the great artists and thinkers of vienna but then i began to see that the book also told the story of the flower children and the new agers and that it had reached a place where it wasnt just about one life but more about the evolution of the soul in history
3176136 i got up at 4 30 on the third day that i was reading it in order to be finished before i left for work and when my wife woke up i looked at her and said i think this is an important book it really feels like it has been in the making for that whole time let me put it this way i have yet to meet the person who could write this book in a year
3176137 the biggest gift that my characters offer one another is what dorothy gets at the end of her story when she is given the belief that she is good enough and that whatever else has happened in the past she is now set free to be herself and to do her job
3176138 so you are saying there is biblical permission for this sort of thing
3176139 i dont think that is what my aunt prudence had in mind when she read ecclesiastes
3176140 you know there is something i have been very desirous of doing
3176141 because the contribution he made was to demonstrate the value of truly fearless introspection freud had a kind of doggedness an insistence that introspection not stop that it should keep going until the patient was free to devote his or her life to the core human activities love and work and thats what wheeler burden is able to do for his beloved he sets her free from her past to do what she was meant to do
3176142 the women who embraced in the wagon were adam and eve on a dark cathedral stage no eve and eve loving one another as they would not be able to once they ate of the fruit and knew themselves as they truly were she felt curiously moved curiously envious of them she saw that the women in the cart had a passionate loving intimacy forever closed to her how strong it made them what comfort it gave
3176143 helen my joy and my beloved why do we stay i have no reason beyond a few pupils who would miss me briefly and your life would be infinitely better away from him let us go away together away from the anger and imperatives of men we shall find ourselves a secluded bower where they dare not venture there will be only the two of us and we shall linger through long afternoons of sweet retirement in the evenings i shall read to you while you work your cross stitch in the firelight and then we shall go to bed our bed my dearest girl

3176145 the aim is that good performance in reducing carbon emissions will become a badge of honour for a city that will help it attract more investment
3176146 this data was not lost by the bbc itself but stolen from an independent production company working for cbbc however we took the issue very seriously
3176147 this loss of data clearly highlights an issue for businesses when sharing sensitive information with third parties
3176148 large organisations may feel confident in their own security practices but problems can arise when information is being shared with third parties who may not have implemented sufficient security settings
3176149 this loss of information would not have posed any kind of threat if the memory stick had been encrypted as a result of weak security procedures the stolen data has in fact provided valuable information with which to perpetrate both virtual and physical crime

3176159 market supply is constrained in the uk but the demand for high quality data centre space is growing

3176161 all the big blue chips are looking for permanent staff but they cant match the salary job hunters are asking for so in the end they have to go with the contractor option where firms have more flexibility in what they can pay
3176162 another public sector body holds open days for women to test out its it department for a day in order to encourage women into permanent it roles

3176171 hey maybe you could leave some scraps for the rest of us
3176172 i would suspect a majority of employees would probably be in favor of something like this these days
3176173 the pretax earnings contributions from the regional mobileassociates are expected to grow at low double digit level andat a pace slower than the past two years
3176174 we will be able to manage employee schedules by accurately matching staffing requirements to customer demand and expect substantial improvements in customer conversion rates as a result
3176175 and customers will experience a greater level of service with more staff available to meet their requirements
3176176 says the number one issue facing pennsylvanians is rising energy costs
3176177 wants to utilize current u s resources by promoting domestic drilling as the part of the energy solution as well as developing alternative fuels
3176178 we need an american energy policy that embraces all of the above that means increased domestic oil production wind solar nuclear natural gas clean coal or for that matter anything other source that shows an ability to compete in the market

3176194 this project represents the first comprehensive multi university collaborative effort in investigating security issues for grid computing including storage information management and collaboration tools for sensitive data
3176195 while many companies are involved in grids their security model is often not capable of handling the complexity the air force deals with which includes heterogeneous data and diverse partners with different clearances
3176196 comprehensive policies for data sharing are extremely critical and this project should provide fundamental insights into that
3176197 the most challenging part of the project is to ensure the information grid is secure and at the same time ensure information is managed shared and disseminated efficiently
3176198 we are becoming a top tier institution in areas such as data security and knowledge discovery
3176199 we are also introducing novel new courses on topics such as cloud computing that address the needs of government industry and academia alike

3176211 russian forces had captured the georgian town of gori 60 km 35 miles from the capital tbilisi but russia denied it and reuters witnesses saw no troops in the town

3176471 were particularly interested in engaging with designers who have not typically been involved with open source projects and were biasing towards broad participation not finished implementations
3176472 words are great but you know what they say about pictures
3176473 mockups offer up a visual and communicate ideas in terms that are just a bit more polished and real
3176474 so that we can all effectively collaborate on the exploration
3176475 could the web browser help you follow and participate in online discussions
3176476 do not walk behind me walk with me do not work for me work with me
3176477 if youre losing your balance you arent kicking hard enough
3176478 20 seconds in this posture is as good as 8 hours sleep
3176479 i bow to you lets come together energetically to a place of connection and timelessness
3176480 yeah im glad they are searching you too but i think the spandex girl and i are pretty safe bets
3176481 l em casa tem um po o mas a gua muito limpa
3176482 wow was i na ve and what the heck was i thinking wearing leg warmers in florida
3176483 i had more adrenaline going than i ever had in my life
3176484 all of us knew what were capable of but to actually do it to get that tradition back its a phenomenal feeling still right now im in disbelief
3176485 this is crazy but it makes sense right in a crazy sort of way
3176486 i use the power of marketing and persuasion tactics to devise new savings programs for people who may be aware of the need to save but this awareness does not translate into behavior
3176487 in movies the guy says tell me where the golden goose is or i will kill you and the other person says if you kill me you will never find out people try this logic on the street and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt my kid figured out my threat was not credible
3176488 physicians want to think its the medicine and not their enthusiasm about a particular drug that makes a drug more therapeutically effective but now we really have to worry about the nuances of interaction between patients and physicians
3176489 the placebo effect is one of the most fascinating least harnessed forces in the universe
3176490 and how do we give people cheaper medication or a generic without them thinking it wont work
3176491 they have a huge potential to use these quality cues to be more effective
3176492 there will be a demand stepping up for these kinds of services and to a certain level we have a feeling of confidence
3176493 having someone that you can sit down with objectively in order to get some good advice and honest feedback is important
3176494 when you are laid off youre in shock it may be the first time in your career that its happened to you
3176495 we cant solve these big global challenges without business engagement
3176496 and business cant operate without solving these problems so there is philosophical alignment
3176497 people do worry about moral hazard although i think that bear stearns was significantly punished
3176498 again theres moral hazard issues as to whether you should do that
3176499 but the problem is so significant here i think you could reasonably argue that it is a time for the treasury department and the administration to put some taxpayers money at risk here in order to reduce the risks and help homeowners
3176500 when we ask questions it can actually change peoples behaviours
3176501 between what they want to do and what they should do
3176502 people have these implicit and explicit attitudes toward things at a conscious level you may say oh you know drinking a lot is bad for me and i shouldnt do that and i answer no i wont do that
3176503 but at a gut level theres a desire to engage in these vices especially for these young people
3176504 we believe that when you just ask the question and dont engage in any follow up at all people have a flash of themselves engaging in that vice behaviour
3176505 this puts a huge onus on parents we really just have to commit to really engaging in really hard and difficult and lengthy dialogues to try to get our kids to change their underlying gut level responses to some of these behaviours
3176506 not every child is going to have a desire to try crystal meth but some of them might and its those kids that i worry about
3176507 questions arent going to affect every single child asked but they are going to affect the ones that have these preformed positive inclinations towards the behaviour
3176508 is to say are you planning to drink at that party on friday and they say oh no not me dad and you say good and you walk away
3176509 that way of engaging in dialogue is really dangerous because if your child happens to be one of those kids that has a positive predisposition you activated it by asking the question
3176510 they were more likely to imagine positive events near in the future and negative events as distant in the future
3176511 it gives people motivation to get up in the morning
3176512 if they have optimistic projections theyre more likely to be able to work and function
3176513 my evidence shows that taking anxious people and making them optimistic doesnt make them do better
3176514 in fact they do less well and arent as happy
3176515 there are potential costs if others see you as pessimistic
3176516 folks who do have a more optimistic outlook seem to have a more adaptive immune response to the environment
3176517 when we find a relationship between some aspect of immune system functioning and some kind of optimism that doesnt mean that if you change one you change the other
3176518 they pay their credit cards on time they tell you that they save because saving is a good thing to do extreme optimists are just the opposite they have short planning horizons they dont pay their credit cards off on time as you get extremely optimistic the good behaviors drop off
3176519 once its part of your checking account youre more likely to want to hold on to it
3176520 even though money should be fungible how money comes to us determines how we spend it
3176521 while many consumers say they plan to pay down debt with their checks we know a portion may go to everyday spending needs or special wants
3176522 right now were listening to what customers tell us about their plans later this spring so that our prices will help make their dollars go even further
3176523 you and your irrational brain an evening of experimentation under the stars
3176524 it stays there for three or four months well have 4 gasoline
3176525 would make it apparent to people how much they are paying and remind them how much they used to pay
3176526 you know now weve hit 100 and were done with that and prices drop back 20 or 30 to something more consistent with supply and demand
3176527 at this price you can guarantee there will be energy legislation in the u s that reduces the demand for oil
3176528 at these prices other types of energy make sense we can get things other than petroleum that will drive us down the road
3176529 other excuses its close to that for the increase are a fire at a 100 000 barrel per day refinery in canada
3176530 its not a really big thing about 0 1 of world oil production but it seems to move prices anyway
3176531 a lot of saber rattling by the energy nations that are the least friendly to the u s such as venezuela and iran talking about not taking dollars for oil
3176532 yeah im gonna need 24 tall skinny soy lattes with sugar free hazelnut extra hot and 32 grande no caff cappuccinos with light whip cream sugar free hazelnut and vanilla with white chocolate mocha and 14 grande supremos with a triple shot sugar free vanilla extra white mocha no whip no foam and an extra drizzle oh and can i get a smiley face on the bottom of all those
3176533 goooooood morning today how are you some kinda weather were having isnt it i wish i was outside in the park wouldnt that be nice its sooooo sunny and whats better for you than a nice big dose of mr sun maybe some coffee ha so what can we get you today need a little pick me up you do i think we all could use one yes we could yes we could anyway ill get this chai order right up for you whats your name terry thats my cousins name small world yes it is small world indeed hi and how are you doing today
3176534 non fat grande soy chai latte with a half shot of espresso and no foam
3176535 well heres the thing i just didnt have time to make it over to my usual coffee place you know the one way over on 2nd ave yeah its one of the last mom and pop coffee shops in the area i toooootally love that place its so real i was on my way over there but the traffic was a killer so i was totally forced to get my fix at this place i mean the rich get richer right thats the law of the land i totally cant stand that i have to come here but thats what they do they tie your hands man these big corporations they just own you theyre everywhere can you hand me one of those splenda
3176536 gee whats this movie pursuit of happyness about i didnt hear of it last summer when it grossed over 100 million dollars even though ive come here for coffee i should carefully peruse the back cover to find out more about it
3176537 well if it looks wrong to you shouldnt you double check it
3176538 i worried about a foreclosure on my home so i just got a second job and i cut back on my cable tv and my home phone
3176539 everybody needs to take a hard look at how they spend money
3176540 the no 1 thing you want to do is minimize expenses that you have to meet month in month out things like car insurance homeowners insurance health insurance
3176541 have a garage sale and sell the skis the clothes you havent worn for six months the videos and the cds and use every penny you get to pay down your debt on your credit card
3176542 she is considering getting an mba now seems like a good time
3176543 one of the main differences is that corporate balance sheets are in good shape
3176544 we havent seen slashing because companies are in fairly good shape
3176545 it is not to say that you shouldnt hedge but it is not time to panic
3176546 i would take a one year view there is so much uncertainty
3176547 if you are only 25 id take the longer view but be careful to keep your horizon short dont over commit yourself to one strategy or another so that you are locked in and cant change
3176548 when we started the business we didnt foresee the mortgage industry going down the tubes
3176549 we havent really gone shopping for clothes in the last year
3176550 one of the main differences is that corporate balance sheets are in good shape
3176551 i sometimes wonder if i should have invested so much in the one cow
3176552 it may seem surprising to suggest having a child at a younger age even if the woman places no importance on having a child until a certain age
3176553 but the model takes into account the fact that taking a maternity leave has less impact on the future career of a woman who is a student or in the beginning of her professional life this woman s child will also be older and slightly more independent by the time the woman has reached the critical years of her career
3176554 we use decision analysis all the time to guide complex business and policy questions and decisions so why not use the structured approach to improve our understanding for making important personal decisions
3176555 a model like this doesn t and shouldn t preclude the role of emotion input from the woman s partner and other factors in personal decision making
3176556 the remarkable faculty that have been chosen for these awards are truly change agents when it comes to bringing discussions of issues of social and environmental responsibility into the mba classroom
3176557 through their research in areas ranging from employee empowerment and stakeholder management to social entrepreneurship these faculty winners are helping foster those discussions in corporations and the community at large
3176558 the significant increase in nominations is an indication that more business school faculty are tackling these difficult issues
3176559 significantly shorter maturity higher likelihood of being secured by assets and more covenant restrictions
3176560 many of the significant restatements moved loan prices but the non interest rate effects were also very important
3176561 its an interesting study but it relates to a period when about 1 of public companies were making restatements
3176562 pre sarbanes oxley data may not be as relevant to whats happening now
3176563 the restatements made prior to sarbanes oxley had more meat on the bone
3176564 certain restatements may not require immediate action and that in the majority of situations only the financial statements that would be included in a companys most recent filing would require restatement
3176565 its really aggravated the chinese government because it takes stuff outside and puts it on display internationally
3176566 stop harboring terrorist and be a destructive force in the middle east
3176567 the government needs to regulate big oil by having them invest a percentage of the record profits into hydrogen infrastructure then the car companies can mass produce fuel cell cars theyve already developed the oil companies will still profit from the hydrogen and the environment gets a break
3176568 its a win win situation except for the middle east and sorry saudi arabia iraq iran but we need to get off of the petroleum ride and start our own now if we could just get our representatives in washington to listen
3176569 hey guys you think your gas prices are bad regular fuel in vancouver canada costs us 5 25 per u s gallon
3176570 i would love to pay lower gas prices and have a plethora of low cost flight options but quite frankly im willing to pay the price if it encourages americans to conserve and industry to invest in alternative forms of energy
3176571 one of the worst things that could happen is for the price of oil to drop to 70 a barrel deceiving everyone into believing that that the old american way of life is preserved
3176572 we had a period of over easy financing that will show up across the board
3176573 i dont think weve really seen the full scale of the problem yet
3176574 consumers havent lost any wealth at all in fact consumers are better off than they were a year ago
3176575 jams are hardly complex things but people saw 24 stacked together and thought i have no idea how to deal with this
3176576 did your parents teach you this was good to eat
3176577 there must be other things you could have of all the instant foods available in the uk the only option you like is cheese and tomato spaghetti value meals
3176578 they assume ordinary people do a constant cost benefit analysis on everything they do but actually after you reach a decision you say thats the end of it and just continue
3176579 in standard economics that should be your most immediate thought how much pleasure is this giving me and what would i pay for it setting that price should come automatically but in reality its very hard to do
3176580 well i object to paying 4 50 it used to be 4
3176581 in the states it costs 20 would you pay that much there
3176582 first the woman moaned about paying more than 4 then she agreed to pay 20 10
3176583 we all do it a standard economist would say that by definition every shopper is making the best decision they can but consumers dont set their own prices from scratch theyre guided by the recommended retail price or the manufacturers suggested price even discounts are set by the shops
3176584 when you see something for free for free its like pressing a magic button you forget about any possible downside and just think oh my god its all good
3176585 i chose the wrong car because of an oil change worth 150
3176586 attempts to explain that they were trying to ascertain whether there was a mutually beneficial trade of time for money that might improve their welfare and that of the next person in line without disadvantaging others met with little success
3176587 economists treat all people as selfish as independent as rational those are the assumptions that underpin economics
3176588 that would be true if we all made mistakes in lots of different ways which would cancel each other out
3176589 but if we all make similar mistakes there is something systematically wrong and that is often what really happens
3176590 we all get too afraid of whats happening and we feed on each others fears the stock market is exaggerating this widespread fear
3176591 money i dont know ive never had much on holidays i am very adventurous sex somewhere in the middle
3176592 money and risk are abstract complex things but think how quickly she made plans for me to spend my lifetime income id spend the same amount of time planning for my retirement as i would have done on buying a new digital camera
3176593 we must be clear about what people can do and cant do we should trust them entirely on what they know such as their priorities and we should completely discount what theyre saying on what they cant know like how much they need for their retirement income
3176594 it might have been that they were worried about losing the 17bn in interest charges
3176595 after 9 11 bush urged americans to spend he made it a patriotic duty avoiding recessions is partly about holding up confidence so people still feel like spending
3176596 one of the features of the boom was overoptimism in spending and markets
3176597 even for economists such as me its incredibly difficult to compute how much borrowing is in your best interest
3176598 so you could tell people how much they can borrow
3176599 they borrow a lot do you seriously want potential entrepreneurs to sit an exam before they get funding
3176600 whats the big deal lets limit peoples ability to hurt themselves in borrowing like we do with seatbelts in driving
3176601 what youre often paying for is nice treatment next time around
3176602 ok i understood the clinical side of things as im a vascular surgeon
3176603 i understood the administrative side through my experience at the cleveland clinic but what i didnt understand was the business
3176604 increasingly more of what we do requires an understanding of the business
3176605 skills ive learnt over the last year have helped me out tremendously
3176606 weve seen unprecedented demand for services the explosion of information systems the issues of quality improvement and we still have to deal with the issue of how to pay who to pay and how much to pay for these changes
3176607 physicians typically dont have the skills to answer these questions
3176608 the theme is physician leadership we take the subjects you would find on a typical mba course and drive them down to specific issues in the healthcare industry
3176609 there is a lot more recognition on the part of doctors that as physicians we are being asked to participate in system issues we historically have no background in
3176610 here at duke for example the department of medicine is a more than 100 million a year operation you cant in due conscience manage that kind of organisation without general business skills
3176611 healthcare is still a business which can be optimised towards a general outcome
3176612 there is no reason why those optimisation skills cant bring you an improved outcome on health or efficiency within the organisation
3176613 physicians are sick and tired of not being able to deliver the changes in healthcare they want theyre looking to acquire the knowledge and skills set to fight back
3176614 but it isnt a substitute for experience the degree doesnt make you a senior partner at an investment firm
3176615 i dont think not by a long shot that every physician needs an mba
3176616 only those who are really going to get involved in the high powered financial analysis
3176617 the average physician who wants to manage a practice or manage a department with 10 or 12 doctors they need courses in management in medical school
3176618 tackle it like any other knowledge gap you have in clinical practice
3176619 the power of voice managerial affective states and future firm performance
3176620 consider a manager who believes she is competent and in control of the firm information about firm performance would reflect her actions taken while running the firm if the manager has private information that is inconsistent with her beliefs regarding her competence an uncomfortable emotional state will arise
3176621 type ccd 3 4 million total pixels 3 2 million effective pixels
3176622 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
3176623 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
3176624 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3176625 tough practical and humane immigration reform in the first year of the next administration
3176626 has been restricted because some large financial institutions including some commercial and investment banks have reported substantial losses and writedowns reducing their available capital
3176627 the capacity and willingness of some large institutions to extend new credit remains limited
3176628 financial strains on credit cost and availability have become increasingly evident bernankes comments mirror some of the findings of the most recent quarterly
3176629 the fear that everyone else knows more so ill just go along
3176630 another is the fear that the boss has already really decided so why bother to stick my neck out
3176631 youve got to make sure that people with unique information share it or else youre likely to focus only on what is held in common
3176632 youre better off with a smaller group representing diverse viewpoints than a larger group that is similar
3176633 people have to feel psychologically safe to make mistakes and say stupid things
3176634 if its yellow let it mellow and if its brown flush it down
3176635 the sfo logistics center has historically been used as a government services distribution facility
3176636 the borrower realized an opportunity to take an existing asset with strong distribution qualities and an irreplaceable location add immense value by merging the property with the adjacent site which will greatly enhance the distribution and logistical qualities of the asset
3176637 that would have been very very bad and would have made the voucher much less valuable
3176638 a very clear report that combines recent thinking with hard practical experience invaluable for organizations that are looking for tangible help in improving their approach to strategic hr
3176639 this in depth study of hr shared services is by far one of the most extensively researched and thorough that i have read
3176640 a pragmatic thought provoking report using insightful case studies and research a must read
3176641 with green building and sustainability initiatives cutting across all industry groups its an asset to our clients that greenberg traurig has attorneys who are well versed in this rapidly emerging field

3176651 they can be as good as anyone else that has played the game
3176652 a number of these folks already do harvest blogs or post to various wine bulletin boards about the progress of harvest
3176653 but we thought it would be a great idea to create a pinot noir focused site where we combine updates from all these producers appellations and vineyards in one location
3176654 weve designed pinotharvest com to be a collective of harvest experiences and insights
3176655 if you want to know about the west coasts pinot harvest and the people involved this is the blog to bookmark visitors can check in daily for regular updates or click on favorite posters for specifics from their vineyards or appellations
3176656 at this time of year its impossible to view life beyond harvest
3176657 its just so all consuming but if there is a desire for more on the part of our posters and audience you never know we may come up with something
3176658 very rarely am i able to get three days of use out of it before having to stick it back into the charger

3176662 we always believed in the potential in mobile entertainment that could be enjoyed anywhere any time and on any device
3176663 remember 1998 was an era when mobile phones had monochrome screens with room for 16 speed dial numbers people thought we were crazy but we knew our software solutions would make it easy for handsets to become less about voice and more about the mobile lifestyle especially mobile media
3176664 now our solutions power video recording video downloads streaming video on demand mobile broadcast video and two way video telephony
3176665 and thats just the video side of our business we have just as many solutions in mobile music
3176666 home networks are usually created so that multi pc households can share a broadband connection but why not enjoy your favorite media services on your home devices
3176667 you should be able to rent a video using your phone and watch it on your tv listen to a radio station personalized just for you on your stereo system or share your pictures with your friends and family on their tvs
3176668 obtaining photos video and music on the mobile phone is on the rise weve liberated that media from the phone to be enjoyed around the home at the same time we have made the mobile phone a remote control or a mobile preview device
3176669 user generated content has just exploded and now that high quality cameras and camcorders are standard on mass market mobile phones we want to make it easy to get those photos and videos off the phone and in front of friends and family
3176670 the mobile phone will continue to be the consumers camera music player tv and web browser and we plan to add a few more things to that including being a gateway to your home network and your media collections

3179643 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3179644 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3179645 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3179646 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3179647 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3179648 analysts say the international communitys response to the conflict in georgia has been lukewarm
3179649 in part because theyve become very dependent on russian oil and gas particularly gas for example in the case of germany russia provides 42 percent of germanys natural gas so the germans who were probably expected to take the leading role here have been neutralized
3179650 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3179651 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3179652 we are all the thing girls ex pure in heart schools
3179653 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3179657 sometimes ive been sitting on trains everystop i get to im clocking that game bonafide hustler making my name we pack and deliver like ups trucks
3179658 english boy with accent and i got the energy im still hungry and more ready than ive ever
3179659 its not that im afraid to die i just dont want to be there when it happens
3179660 in the beginning god with jesus and the holy spirit there saying i second that motion
3179661 the word incarnate nefesh dwelt among us for a while
3179662 to further this point i would argue that death without the reliance on god the spiritual component is at least to some degree
3179663 by the year 2000 the world may catch up with the way compuserves electronic mail lets you shop today

3179666 the sensors are so good that they can record water temperature salinity and pressure even tell us what the animal was doing
3179667 prices are going up for what is available but quite a lot of is not available at all
3179668 weve had to pay more than double just to keep our plant going
3179669 its not that all the materials used to come from china
3179670 but because china has stopped theres pressure on materials coming from taiwan korea europe and everyones taking a little bit advantage and jacking up their prices
3179671 here in india we have inflation running at 10 shortages of raw materials and input costs are rising
3179672 if you have price control what choice do you have you have the choice of cutting down production and thats when itll hurt the consumer the common person
3179673 if the prices of the raw materials for controlled drugs rises any further theres a chance that the production of such drugs will simply stop
3179674 i think its highly likely that after september therell be shortages of those drugs in india
3179675 the projects that are receiving support today will develop and bring new technologies to market boosting the states economy and creating and sustaining good jobs for maine people
3179676 these are smart investments in our states technology sectors to transition to a 21st century economy building on our strengths over the years these investments have generated new good paying jobs across our state and leveraged federal funding for path breaking centers of excellence
3179677 johnny had a past history of drug abuse but once we became aware of it a year ago he got help and we helped him
3179678 for us to find him dead and to hear about the toxicology report is still a shock
3179679 after we went to bed maybe he thought ive been clean for a long time maybe he was rewarding himself addictive behavior is strange sometimes but his tolerance had definitely gone down and its tragic
3179680 the most obvious question people are going to assume that since we play in a rock band that this was because of an alcohol or drug overdose but i can vouch for him it wasnt anything like that at all
3179681 our band is drug free and he knew that and we believed that he was he just slipped up
3179682 i wish it wasnt something like heroin because when something like this happens people look at the person who died as some kind of freak or something
3179683 but really he was an amazing kid he was so amazing that his mind just ran all the time i just hope that wherever hes at now he has that peace that he wanted
3179684 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3179685 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3179686 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3179687 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3179688 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3179689 i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on
3179690 the one guys loyalty and passion over there i dont question is his i think we have eliminated any and all excuses now no one can point any fingers
3179691 we respect cobi hes stepping in and filling a void whether or not cobis comfortable being the head coach or whether or not he has the experience well play that one by ear cobi certainly will have a voice in this
3179692 that said well see where we go with the head coaching position
3179693 i dont think were going to mandate or dictate that
3179694 we certainly could make a quick decision if thats whats necessary my guess is a lot of people will want to throw their name in the ring here
3179695 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start
3179696 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start
3179697 i deeply deeply apologize to the court and to all those ive affected by my conduct

3179712 ibew local 97 has endorsed tracey brooks for congress in new yorks 21st district because she has been a good friend to labor and a strong advocate for the issues important to our members and working families like health care for all pay equity and retaining and creating good paying jobs here in the capital region
3179713 with the support of ibew our other friends in labor and working families throughout the district we will go to washington to take on the republicans and special interests in washington and make government accountable to the people once again
3179714 together we will fight for guaranteed health care for all to end the war in iraq and invest that money here at home and end the high gas prices that are hurting our economy and working families

3179717 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3179718 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3179719 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3179720 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3179721 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3179722 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3179723 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3179724 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3179725 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3179726 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3179727 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3179728 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3179729 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3179730 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3179731 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3179732 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3179733 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3179734 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3179735 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

3179738 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3179739 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3179740 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3179741 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3179742 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3179743 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3179744 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3179745 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3179746 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

3179748 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3179749 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3179750 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3179751 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3179752 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

3179793 i could choose to be purely good but i will not i could choose to be purely evil but i will not i will be neutral in that way i am free to be what suits me best and no man can predict my actions
3179794 we strive to destroy the evil around us yet we often forget that there is no light without darkness nor darkness without light perhaps a plant it the best analogy a plant realizes that too little light is deadly but it also knows that too much light is equally deadly it is the balance of the two that makes the world

3179837 while we commend you for personally apologizing to the newspapers on behalf of the fbi and for personally bringing this matter to the committees attention we expect to receive a more complete accounting of this violation of the justice departments guidelines intended to protect privacy and journalists first amendment rights
3179838 if nothing else these new findings suggest a pressing need for the legislation we have cosponsored with a bipartisan group of senators to create a qualified privilege for reporters
3179839 the fbi used the exigent letters in non emergency circumstances failed to ensure that there were duly authorized investigations to which the requests could be tied and failed to ensure that nsls were issued promptly after the fact
3179840 leases also can get tied up in court often over environmental concerns

3179842 the 68 million acres they chatter about pales in comparison to the 1 76 billion acres of the outer continental shelf
3179843 a lease is merely a permission slip to look for oil not a guarantee of finding any
3179844 an oil company can spend several years after it negotiates a lease securing the permits and other approvals it needs to begin actual production leases also can get tied up in court often over environmental concerns
3179845 we need answers not just slogans we have senators going to saudi arabia begging for them to increase their production but we wont increase ours in some of the most potential productive areas
3179846 i think theres a lot of opposition from energy democrats to use it or lose it you cant produce on every acre or even every 100 acres i think those numbers come from people who dont understand this business
3179847 larry nation spokesman for the american association of petroleum geologists funded by member fees not the oil companies points out that oil companies lease land that might have oil but not all of it does and it takes years to discover whether the oil is there
3179848 now comes a new wrinkle another attempt to dodge sensible policy this one from west virginias rep nick rahall he proposes to give big oil companies an ultimatum unless they drill on the 68 million acres of inactive land they now lease from the federal government or give up those leases they would be barred from getting new leases rahalls bill is yet another pitiful attempt to avoid doing what clearly needs to be done make more u s reserves available to u s companies

3179891 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3179892 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3179893 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3179894 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3179895 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3179896 our approach to security software and optimization tools has been to offer consumers the flexibility to choose an appropriate solution whether it is a combination of standalone products or a comprehensive and fully integrated package to meet individual consumer needs
3179897 our approach to the 2009 range is no exception to this philosophy
3179898 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3179899 i read this before on another site last week its old
3179900 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3179901 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3179902 apostle to zaire the life and legacy of blessed father cosmas of grigoriou
3179903 as a result of conversations with illumined fathers on mount athos and indications he received from his own conscience while in the mission field father cosmas knew to be patient that the work was just beginning and that he would not see its full flowering in this life
3179904 however the struggle will be a long one for the people there will be slow in coming to accept christianity
3179905 is a linkage of ones own temperament knowledge possibilities and local conditions it is not necessary to follow certain molds the missionary is free and when he is open to the grace of god the holy spirit will speak riches in his heart and indicate to him what to do gradually and in correspondence to the development of the work let us leave room for prayer to act without rushing the situation with narrow logic absolute measures or the assessments of critics at each stage

3179932 is only running ahead of bushs 2004 result in four states
3179933 is doing at least 2 46 percentage points better than kerry in 41 states in 2004 2 46 was bushs margin of victory in the national popular vote

3179969 that this house notes with extreme concern plans by south west trains to close ticket offices and cut ticket office opening hours at 114 stations believes that such cuts cannot be justified when these stations have seen a combined increase in passengers of nearly 27 per cent in the last year is further concerned that the cuts will dramatically increase the number of stations that will lose their ticket offices entirely during weekends and will leave stations unstaffed at weekends and in the evening making railway stations and passengers who use them feel less secure believes that replacing staff with ticket machines will also reduce the quality and range of services available to passengers and calls on south west trains immediately to withdraw its plans
