5000000 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5000001 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5000002 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5000003 who are open to doing something on the production side
5000004 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5000005 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5000006 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5000007 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5000008 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5000009 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5000010 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5000011 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5000012 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5000013 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5000014 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5000015 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5000016 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5000017 wir werden in die modernisierung der service center investieren und kleinere standorte in gr ere berf hren
5000018 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5000019 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5000020 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5000021 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5000022 sie haben doch mal bei der skl gespielt nun haben wir f r sie ein neues angebot
5000023 ich will dass solche machenschaften aufh ren deshalb mache ich sie jetzt ffentlich
5000024 wir brauchen eine datenschutzkultur und ein bewusstsein dar ber dass daten die im internet preisgegeben werden eine andere qualit t haben als in der herk mmlichen welt
5000025 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5000026 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5000027 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5000028 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5000029 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5000030 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5000031 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5000032 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5000033 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5000034 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5000035 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
5000036 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5000037 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5000038 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5000039 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5000040 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5000041 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
5000042 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
5000043 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
5000044 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
5000045 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5000046 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5000047 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5000048 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5000049 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5000050 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5000051 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5000052 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5000053 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5000054 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5000055 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5000056 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5000057 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5000058 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5000059 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5000060 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5000061 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5000062 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5000063 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5000064 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5000065 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5000066 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5000067 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5000068 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5000069 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5000070 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5000071 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5000072 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5000073 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5000074 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5000075 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5000076 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5000077 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5000078 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5000079 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5000080 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5000081 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5000082 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5000083 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5000084 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5000085 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5000086 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5000087 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5000088 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5000089 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
5000090 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
5000091 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
5000092 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
5000093 i wrote and asked if it was okay to do so jo bolt thrower bassist replied gave the green light and the first one drops into the rss feed in a few days
5000094 i enjoy reading books that confirm my preexisting belief in the inevitability of patriarchy
5000095 they keep breaking in and taking everything ive got i just get another lock and back i come again
5000096 because theres so many weirdos dont take what i say the wrong way but i always want to suss people out im pretty careful in the company i keep
5000097 and if love is just a game then how come its no fun
5000098 oh well in five years time we could be walking round a zoo with the sun shining down over me and you and therell be love in the bodies of the elephants too and ill put my hands over your eyes but youll peep through all over our bodies and sun sun sun all down our necks and sun sun sun all over our faces and sun sun sun and well be laughing about how we used to smoke all those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine cos its what we needed to have a good time when we were drinking it was fun fun fun when we were drunk and it was fun fun fun when we were laughing it was fun fun fun oh well i look at you and say its the happiest that ive ever been and ill say i no longer feel i have to be james dean and shell say yeah well i feel all pretty happy too and im always pretty happy when im just kicking back with you love love love all through our bodies and love love love all through our minds and it be love love love all over her face and love love love all over mine although maybe all these moments are just in my head ill be thinking bout them as im lying in bed and all that i believe might never really come true but in my mind im havin a pretty good time with you i might not know you five years time we might not speak in five years time we might not get along in five years time oh therell be love love love wherever you go therell be love
5000099 wie sie nicht nur die neue landesregierung bilden sondern wie sie auch durch die ganze legislatur kommen

5000103 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
5000104 any american movement inside iraq will be bound by iraqi consultation and approval
5000105 and the agreement will be soon but not resolved finally
5000106 we will not rush the signing of the agreements the important thing is that they are suitable for both sides
5000107 setting any timetable takes into consideration the actual situations on the ground setting any timetable depends on the development and course of events
5000108 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government
5000109 president musharraf says he will not bow to these pressures will not quit and will defend himself
5000110 we want stability in the country we want political stability we want to make progress in the light of the mandate that has been given to our government
5000111 la repressione delle autorit contro gli uighuri ha proseguito kadeer si intensificata nei mesi che hanno preceduto le olimpiadi con arresti ed esecuzioni
5000112 syria helps israel to continue the occupation of the shaba farms
5000113 the lebanese syrian summit did not confirm the lebanese identity of these farms
5000114 a joint lebanese syrian document be sent to the united nations declaring that the farms are lebanese
5000115 may be a positive beginning for the relations between the two countries
5000116 establishment of diplomatic relations between lebanon and syria has been one of the demands that were made by the 14 march group since the beginning of the independence uprising following the assassination of former prime minister rafik al hariri on 14 february 2005
5000117 we welcomed all declarations of intent regarding these demands the latest declaration came in that joint lebanese syrian communiqu however we expect serious implementation by fixing a firm and clear date for establishing these relations for our part we will ask the lebanese government to start from today to take all the measures to establish these relations as soon as possible
5000118 we are not surprised to see the state which negotiates with israel in turkey disregarding all arab resolutions helping the israeli occupation forces to remain in the shaba farms by rejecting the demarcation of the border there
5000119 anyway in order for the syrian government to prove its seriousness in dealing with this issue we suggest that the demarcation of the borders between us begin from the al masna border point to the north and south simultaneously
5000120 a positive beginning in the fulfillment of the long list of demands that were agreed upon at the negotiating table
5000121 this move may establish the required relations according to the al taif agreement which called for distinguished relations however the two states must recognize each other and not interfere in each others internal affairs
5000122 the al taif agreement should always be the starting point because the doha agreement asserted it this agreement should be implemented to the letter in other words the states authority should be extended to all lebanese territories the truce agreement should be enforced and the hezbollah weapons issue should be resolved through the defense plan
5000123 establishment of diplomatic relations resolves the second issue that was agreed upon during the national dialogue the first issue is the international tribunal that deals with the assassination of former prime minister al hariri and the third one is the border issue
5000124 i remember that hezbollah secretary general sayyid hassan nasrallah used the phrase delineation and then demarcation to avoid causing concerns for syria
5000125 delineation or demarcation of the border does not cancel the lebanese identity of the shaba farms the syrian and lebanese governments should sign and send to the united nations a joint document recognizing the lebanese identity of the shaba farms in order to confirm that the farms belong to lebanon
5000126 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
5000127 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
5000128 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
5000129 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
5000130 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
5000131 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
5000132 we hope the release will help strengthen the peace process
5000133 i prefer to release palestinian prisoners to president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad than to hamas
5000134 this is a wrong decision its outrageous because it reduces the chances of bringing gilad shalit home
5000135 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
5000136 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5000137 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5000138 i think i could sleep better if i completely bury my head with my toys

5000155 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5000156 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5000157 we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture
5000158 in the spirit of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so
5000159 went against party loyalty and maybe even against your own best interest for the good of america
5000160 in this industry its really hard to get your foot in the door but thats the most important part it took me a long time to get my foot in the door but let me tell you this is the place where you want to get your foot in the door
5000161 das management hat sehr gut verstanden dass dies nicht funktionieren w rde
5000162 wir m ssen ein konzept finden das sowohl mlp als auch swiss life mehrwert bringt ob wir daf r die mehrheit brauchen oder ob das auch ber eine minderheitsbeteiligung in absprache mit herrn lautenschl ger manfred lautenschl ger ist mlp aufsichtsratschef und gro aktion r m glich ist wird sich zeigen
5000163 eine solche transaktion w re f r alle beteiligten wertvernichtend
5000164 schon heute hat das ansehen des konzerns bei den beratern stark gelitten denn die sehen die bisherigen ereignisse eindeutig als unfreundlichen akt
5000165 ich bin wohl etwas zu forsch vorgegangen mlp und awd waren wie zwei geschwister von denen keines den anderen als erziehungsberechtigten akzeptieren wollte
5000166 jetzt haben wir eine traummutter die daf r sorgt dass die geschwister sinnvolle dinge zusammen machen k nnen aber trotzdem eigenst ndig bleiben
5000167 richtig ist aber nat rlich dass wir eine gr ere aktienposition aufgebaut haben ohne das mlp davon wusste
5000168 wir werden in die modernisierung unserer service center investieren konkret hei t das wir werden kleinere standorte in gr ere wettbewerbsf hige standorte in deutschland berf hren
5000169 bei der umsetzung des neuen konzeptes wird jedem mitarbeiter ein gleichwertiger arbeitsplatz angeboten und es findet keine verlagerung von arbeitspl tzen ins ausland statt
5000170 offensichtlich f hrt die telekom weiterhin einen kurs gegen ihre eigenen mitarbeiter der vorstand sollte jetzt alle fakten auf den tisch legen
5000171 i need a better solution to keep track of contacts documents and follow up calls which tool would you recommend
5000172 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5000173 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5000174 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5000175 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5000176 jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met

5000196 most people opt for everything off some people like a strip of hair some people like a petite triangle some people like the thumb size patch i hate this one it makes it look like a hitler vag but technically the brazilian is everything south of the equator and whatever you want on the top
5000197 ive gone back and forth i usually go fully bare and sometimes when i want some contouring i sport the petite triangle
5000198 christine where did it all go you mugged me i got nothing left
5000199 i thought you wanted it all off you said give me what you have
5000200 i meant the triangle not everything for christs sake i look like a six year old
5000201 oh liesl im sorry i misunderstood you i wish i would have given you what you wanted but look on the bright side unlike a bad haircut not many people will see this as it grows out but i am really sorry
5000202 im just afraid that the boyfriend is going to think its too much
5000203 but why do they like it anyhow is it because you look like a child cause thats weird
5000204 no its because men are visual and with hair there they cant see much they also like the idea that you go through this complicated and painful ritual to present it to them its like your punani on a silver platter

5000206 yo no tengo ninguna duda que brasil puede llegar a hacer lo mismo que los equipos que enfrentamos hasta ahora en los juegos es m s lo han hecho en los ltimos tres partidos y lamentablemente les ha dado resultado
5000207 si enfrente tenemos un equipo mezquino como lo puede ser brasil no tenemos que volvernos locos en todo caso tendremos que ser mezquinos igual que ellos y tener el mismo cuidado de ellos
5000208 nosotros tenemos que ser inteligentes y no cometer errores porque jugando contra equipos que apuestan todo a una contra si te equivoc s

5000238 while i dont mean to cause jeanes family additional grief an attorneys first duty is to his client and jeane was very clear with me that if she was ever found dead of an apparent suicide i was to make sure that all the evidence was publicly disseminated so that it could be independently evaluated
5000239 this is our road to spiritual growth we change every day this growth is not the result of wishing but of action and prayer

5000242 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5000243 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5000244 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5000245 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5000246 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5000247 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5000250 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5000251 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5000252 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
5000253 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
5000254 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state

5000258 i think after 9 11 my friends we should have told americans to join the peace corps expand the military serve a cause greater than your self interest
5000259 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5000260 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
5000261 i have to tell you up front both of these guys are my friends they both care deeply about america they are both patriots
5000262 they have very different ideas on how america can be strengthened
5000263 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people
5000264 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5000265 means im saved and forgiven our faith encompasses not just america but the world
5000266 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5000267 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5000268 this nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
5000269 they achieved a revolution now the russians are coming in there in an act of aggression we have to not only bring about cease fire we have to have honor
5000270 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5000271 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5000272 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5000273 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5000274 solving big problems are not going to be easy we are all going to think about how we using things energy wise if we pretend like everything is free we are betraying the tradition of america
5000275 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
5000276 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5000277 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5000278 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5000279 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5000280 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
5000281 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
5000282 all he talked about was his family and this city
5000283 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5000284 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5000285 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5000286 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it

5000301 women have served all these centuries as looking glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of a man at twice its natural size
5000302 men who treat women as helpless and charming playthings deserve women who treat men as delightful and generous bank accounts
5000303 women who seek to be equal with men lack ambition
5000304 one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty
5000305 the trouble with some women is they get all excited about nothing and then they marry him

5000325 usually we welcome prince charless contributions to various debates but on this issue he seems to have overstepped the mark
5000326 government ministers have a responsibility to base policy on science and i do strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to the developing world to ask the question can gm crops help
5000327 its easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can im asking to see the evidence if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
5000328 i have never shot a 100 in kneeling and my coach wanted a 100 for me i got that so i look at that as a positive from here i can always say if i was a little better in prone kneeling or standing i could have got into the final i tried but it didnt happen
5000329 both sanjeev rajput and i need to be pushed by a bigger pool of shooters for all performances to keep improving and we need to prepare for the future right from here and not wait for 2010 or 2011 or 2012 games

5000342 it is no longer the issue of land in the jammu region or that of fruit transportation in the valley
5000343 the dangerous dimensions taken by the agitations in the jammu region and the valley plainly indicate the jammuites want secession from the valley and the valley wants secession from the rest of the country
5000344 mirwaiz umer farooq and syed ali geelani two iconic leaders of the separatist movement in kashmir were taken out by crowds to lead the funeral procession of the slain hurriyat leader sheikh abdul aziz

5000346 a record of sorts was created when the one rupee coin of mintage 1960 went under the hammer for rs 220 000 the coin is rarest of the rare as it never came into circulation
5000347 considering its rarity we were expecting a record prize thats why the cut off price for the bid was fixed at rs 200 000
5000348 the coin which fascinated everyone otherwise looks ordinary though its design is quite different with sou naye paise inscribed on top portion
5000349 i have come on this pilgrimage for two days to say thank you for giving india its leader who led us to freedom
5000350 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5000351 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5000352 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5000353 weve got to make the big decisions but we keep putting them off
5000354 i have the ability to build bridges i hope i have the opportunity to do that
5000355 to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than themselves
5000356 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5000357 as india celebrated its 62nd independence day the government has realised that it does not have promises to make but rather promises to keep and this is the long term guarantee made by prime minister manmohan singh to the citizens
5000358 it is an apt solution indias strength lies not in making short term gains but in its resilience to survive the long and tough road ahead
5000359 the government has its work cut out and the prime minister true to character has not flinched against the odds of bringing the economy which is still registering a growth rate but combating climbing inflation back on track
5000360 but the indian people are nothing if not strong willed
5000361 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5000362 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5000363 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5000364 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5000365 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5000366 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5000367 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5000368 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5000369 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5000370 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5000371 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5000372 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5000373 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5000374 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5000375 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5000376 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5000377 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5000378 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5000379 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5000380 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5000381 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5000382 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5000383 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5000384 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5000385 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5000386 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5000387 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5000388 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5000389 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5000390 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5000391 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5000392 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5000393 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5000394 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5000395 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5000396 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5000397 this is a planning took where all things are going
5000398 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5000399 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5000400 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5000401 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5000402 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5000403 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5000404 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5000405 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5000406 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5000407 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5000408 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5000409 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5000410 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5000411 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5000412 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5000413 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5000414 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5000415 unfortunately you have just removed this topic from the unanswered queue so nobody will take a look at it
5000416 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5000417 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5000418 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5000419 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5000420 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5000421 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5000422 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5000423 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5000424 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5000425 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5000426 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5000427 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5000428 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5000429 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year

5000440 we get such requests where a would be mother for some reason wants a caesarean section in such cases a little variation in the time doesnt matter so we heed the request
5000441 we just ensure that the timing does not harm the mother or the child
5000442 it is more of a religious belief most mothers who want a planned delivery usually consult astrologers or priests for the best timing we just want to make a woman happy when she goes home back with her bundle of joy

5000450 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5000451 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5000452 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5000462 his death is a big loss to the kannada film industry and it has shocked many kannada fans who still remember his family oriented films based on good novels
5000463 his contribution to the kannada film industry cannot be undermined his films not only won awards but registered good collections at the box office
5000464 he had a firm grip on the medium and his experience of working under several top directors had also helped him to make crisp films
5000465 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5000466 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5000467 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5000468 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5000469 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5000470 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5000471 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5000472 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5000473 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5000474 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5000475 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5000476 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5000477 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5000478 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5000479 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

5000484 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5000485 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5000486 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5000487 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5000488 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5000489 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa

5000492 he stressed that the signature of the six point ceasefire agreement signed by all the parties concerned most recently by the president of the russian federation must result in the immediate withdrawal of all russian military forces that have entered georgia since august 7
5000493 president medvedev announced to the president of the republic that the withdrawal of russian troops would begin tomorrow monday august 18 in the middle of the day
5000494 that from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia to the security zone and to the territory of south ossetia

5000507 because im a former marine corps officer i thought this was probably a good thing that the colonel and i would have a very cordial marine to marine conversation
5000508 when i said this to my wife she said dont kid yourself theyre going to be out to kill you
5000509 five minutes before i go on i catch their drift which is theyre going to talk about a professor who is using his classroom to teach conspiracy theories about 9 11 to our children
5000510 during that five minutes it occurred to me that i was going to be able to explode this one way or another that i would talk about how they had foxed their facts
5000511 what they were doing was saying i was teaching our children i was offering a course on 9 11 and the way they were defining it in terms of children and kids this had to be a freshman level or equivalent course
5000512 they were attacking me for a non existent course said fetzer
5000513 there was no course that satisfied the description they were trying to nail me for having taught
5000514 the first question out of colmes mouth was is this a required course and i had to explain to him that he had his facts foxed
5000515 the fact is they had defined the parameters i knew they knew they had made a mistake but i wasnt there to argue their case
5000516 when they tried to put me on the spot after they realized they had committed a mistake when they tried to put me on the spot about the society i began to explain some of the findings how the towers had come down by controlled demolition how the fbi was asserting that they had no hard evidence tying osama bin laden to 9 11
5000517 this was when ollie started getting a little nervous and he asks how many there are in your organization when he heard there were 300 and 200 with research credentials 85 actually having academic affiliations it took so much wind out of their sails that they tried to cut it off as quickly as they could

5000571 it is so easy to become engrossed in one circumstance and lose sight of the limitless power that lies within what we have been given
5000572 we will often misdiagnose the problem and feel defeated when we could actually prevail
5000573 now you must understand that positioning requires understanding where you are and measuring it against where you are going

5000579 its a great pity for the dundrod club who had put so much effort into the meeting however from early morning it had been expected that the meeting would be called off
5000580 there had been weather forecasts giving us a bit of hope but as the day went on it was obvious that we were whistling in the dark
5000581 under the current regulations we are unable to hold the meeting on sunday and so the ulster grand prix has been lost
5000582 its as bad as i have seen it i remember that day 20 odd years ago when joey dunlop and myself did two sighting laps but after that the stewards decided to race
5000583 we then had a warm up lap and joey said to me this race shouldnt go ahead lets see it we can stop it we made approaches but to no avail and as you know there was a death on the third lap
5000584 i still remember that day for i had taken an early lead to avoid the rest of the field its a great pity that today has happened but theres nothing one can do about it
5000585 i would have raced had the conditions relented but there was no way that was possible its a great pity for the promoters and the crowd many of them were still in the stands hoping for racing to start
5000586 it is all very sad but to be honest i wouldnt have raced in those conditions
5000587 i was prepared to race but obviously the visibility would have made this dodgy im shattered that the meeting has been abandoned for i was really looking forward to it
5000588 i would have raced but the conditions deteriorated so much that it was really impossible to start
5000589 we held off as long as possible but at the end of the day the weather beat us we tried every avenue and postponement possible and only made our decision to abandon at the last minute
5000590 this weather has been as bad as i have seen it in seven years as clerk of the course but lets get things in perspective during that time weve had two deaths and its more important that we dont race when conditions are impossible
5000591 we have suffered a heavy financial blow but hopefully our meetings with the government in the immediate future will help us regain some of our outlay we are beginning negotiations on monday
5000592 at the time of the abandonment it certainly wasnt raceable i would have gone on alright but it was obviously impossible to ride in such appalling weather its a real shame for all concerned
5000593 we fully support the ulster grand prixs decision to abandon the planned race programme due to the horrendous weather conditions
5000594 the safety of riders and spectators is paramount and the clerk of course cannot take any unnecessary risks we understand it is terribly disappointing for fans and competitors alike but we believe it was the best decision under difficult circumstances
5000595 the council are disappointed that the ulster grand prix had to be cancelled
5000596 the council commiserates with the dundrod club and will work with the club to see that the race is back at dundrod next year
5000597 yes it is very frustrating for me and the players and im sure the fans too
5000598 some of the players felt that it shouldnt have gone ahead but to be fair the referee wanted to give it every chance
5000599 but you could see from very early on that a couple of tackles were going in that werent malicious but because of the conditions it was very dangerous and someone could have got hurt
5000600 i can completely understand the decision and now we have to try and get focused on next weeks game
5000601 it is going to be very difficult to try and fit it in we are only a couple of weeks into the new season and already we are looking at fixture congestion
5000602 we have a county antrim shield game on tuesday night to deal with and then very soon the setanta cup games are coming up its a lot to deal with so early but i suppose everyone is in the same boat
5000603 it was a game that we were all looking forward to because it would give us a real look at how far we have come on and what we have to do
5000604 i thought we played well and i could see that the boys were really up for it and at least thats something i can take out of it
5000605 well just have to get on with it it wasnt ideal but the referee made the right decision to stop it because there was a lot of water lying on the pitch and if there is any danger that someone could get hurt then you have to call it off
5000606 het promoot homoseksualiteit en de boodschap is beschamend en afschuwwekkend
5000607 we zijn een open gezin en katy weet hoe teleurgesteld haar vader en ik zijn
5000608 de boodschap over homoseksualiteit die katy naar buiten brengt staat in de bijbel duidelijk beschreven als een zonde
5000609 de bijbel promoot begrip en vergiffenis ook en dat houd ik mezelf maar voor
5000610 katy is zeer katholiek opgevoed ze was een speciaal kind hield van zingen en had een stem als een engeltje
5000611 toen ik 21 werd ben ik gestopt om me daar druk om te maken
5000612 ik heb aan de russen en de osseten gezegd dat de zuid osseten hun zeg moeten hebben over het uitstippelen van hun toekomst
5000613 dat is maar normaal maar dat de ossetische inbreng kadert in een groter proces
5000614 hes aggressive and seems like hes always around the ball hes got good range and it seems like hes got a good feel on the field for making plays hopefully he can continue to do that during the games and be a good player for our defense maybe get some turnovers and get us the ball back
5000615 one two threeeeee the jonas brothers are taking the kiddie pop market by wailstorm

5000618 little point in listening to the jonas brothers independent of a horde of preteenage girls
5000619 a ton of girls me to love kevin kevin is our fav nick and joe are there to but kevin if you know how much he is doing for the band you would know if there was no him there would be no jonas brothers alot of girls and i were crying this morning and everyday because of the hate that people have for kevin jonas it is horrible what if we starting saying all this stuff about you huhh how you feel even with all this he still is on that stage every night rockin out for us
5000620 olympics go go go china go go go beijing go go go
5000621 im so proud of the way they performed against bath and the great thing from an ulster perspective is that so many of them could still be here in 10 years time
5000622 the number of guys playing who are under 22 is extraordinary i can never recall putting out a team as young as that
5000623 we had no fewer than 11 players wearing ulster jerseys for the first time
5000624 they also displayed huge character in coming back strongly after conceding two tries just before half time and that has to be a good omen for the season that lies ahead
5000625 its vital that these young players can now put their hands up for selection and put pressure on those international players who were sitting in the stand on friday night
5000626 there was a lot more counter attacking in this game than you would have had under the old laws
5000627 the introduction of an offside line five metres behind the scrum is a huge plus in that it offers far greater attacking opportunities
5000628 but ive still no idea why weve given the defensive line out such a massive advantage effectively its going to kill the line out
5000629 in future there will be no need for big towering second rows that have been an integral part of the game for so long
5000630 my wifes scottish and all her family are big scotland fans
5000631 its going to be interesting to see where her loyalties lie on wednesday night
5000632 but ive told her she hasnt got a hope of getting a ticket off me unless she wants to sit in the northern ireland end and cheer us on
5000633 ill be playing for northern ireland and i want us to win scotland are simply another team that must be beaten in my eyes
5000634 yes i may have lived and worked in scotland for some time now but that doesnt mean i want anything less than a good performance and a northern ireland win at hampden
5000635 if that causes a few arguments then so be it
5000636 i want to win this match as much as any other
5000637 i dont buy into the idea that this is just a friendly and therefore doesnt really matter
5000638 it matters to me and im sure it matters to nigel worthington and every member of this squad
5000639 i think its important to set the right tone ahead of the qualifiers and it would be wonderful for team morale
5000640 slovakia next month is very important but i dont view this game any differently
5000641 ive played at hampden park on a few occcasions although they havent been overly memorable for me that would at least change if we managed to get a result on wednesday
5000642 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government

5000650 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5000651 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5000652 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5000653 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it

5000677 i have spent the last few weeks making calls like this because i have been trying to track down every single national anthem that might be heard at this years olympics all 205 of them my plan was to listen to all the anthems the instrumental versions that you hear at the olympics with a music journalists ear and rank them that way i would know who to cheer for there is no other fair way to compare countries musically national anthems are the same the world over a short classical piece meant to stir up pride they have got to be boisterous and bombastic with a tune simple enough that you can shout it whether drunk in a stadium or drunk in front of the tv little did i know that it would take a month to track down four hours 26 minutes and 25 seconds of music or that most of those tunes would be so tedious i would have to limit myself to five a day to stop them putting me ofbrass for life i also didnt expect the search to create in me an undying hatred for both la marseillaise versions of which are used by seven countries and god save the queen used by three

5000683 by eliding past the responsibility of adult women to take control over their own reproductive destinies hirshman allows herself to conclude that womens lives have more value than the lives of their sexual partners who are increasingly being held financially responsible for supporting children it can be conclusively proven they did not father but more disturbingly she also allows herself to dispense with the lives of unborn children as though they were of no value whatsoever she is hardly the only one to do so

5000730 fair hermes crownd with feathers fluttering light i had a splendid dream of thee last night i saw thee sitting on a throne of gold among the gods upon olympus old the only sad one for thou didst not hear the soft muses chaunting clear nor even apollo when he sang alone deaf to his throbbing throats long long melodious moan i dreamt i saw thee robed in purple flakes break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks and swiftly as a bright phoebean dart strike for the cretan isle and here thou art too gentle hermes hast thou found the maid
5000731 thou serpent surely high inspired thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes possess whatever bliss thou canst devise telling me only where my nymph is fled where she doth breathe
5000732 by my serpent rod and by thine eyes and by thy starry crown
5000733 too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine free as the air invisibly she strays about these thornless wilds her pleasant days she tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet from weary tendrils and bowd branches green she plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen and by my power is her beauty veild to keep it unaffronted unassaild by the love glances of unlovely eyes of satyrs fauns and bleard silenus sighs pale grew her immortality for woe of all these lovers and she grieved so i took compassion on her bade her steep her hair in weird syrops that would keep her loveliness invisible yet free to wander as she loves in liberty thou shalt behold her hermes thou alone if thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon
5000734 i was a woman let me have once more a womans shape and charming as before i love a youth of corinth o the bliss give me my womans form and place me where he is stoop hermes let me breathe upon thy brow and thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now
5000735 ah lycius bright and will you leave me on the hills alone lycius look back and be some pity shown
5000736 leave thee alone look back ah goddess see whether my eyes can ever turn from thee for pity do not this sad heart belie even as thou vanishest so i shall die stay though a naiad of the rivers stay to thy far wishes will thy streams obey stay though the greenest woods be thy domain alone they can drink up the morning rain though a descended pleiad will not one of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine so sweetly to these ravishd ears of mine came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade thy memory will waste me to a shade for pity do not melt
5000737 here upon this floor of clay and pain my steps upon these flowers too rough what canst thou say or do of charm enough to dull the nice remembrance of my home thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam over these hills and vales where no joy is empty of immortality and bliss thou art a scholar lycius and must know that finer spirits cannot breathe below in human climes and live alas poor youth what taste of purer air hast thou to soothe my essence what serener palaces where i may all my many senses please and by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease it cannot be adieu

5000755 we will likely see more insolvencies among small u s regional banks that have focused on mortgage business
5000756 i estimate returns in the industry will be more like 15 to 20 percent as a rule
5000757 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
5000758 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
5000759 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
5000760 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
5000761 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
5000762 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
5000763 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
5000764 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
5000765 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
5000766 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
5000767 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning
5000768 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more

5000772 in our treatment program we are seeing something very odd 70 percent of our clients are female five or six years ago three out of 10 clients were women
5000773 we are seeing a flood of young women with children coming into treatment
5000774 we need to do a better job of catching women early and not giving them an antidepressant when they need treatment
5000775 it is a vicious cycle where if you drink because you are depressed it doesnt work you keep drinking and get more depressed and finally get to a place where you cant break out of it nothing really allows you the freedom to focus on what you really need to be focusing on like family children and work you are so caught up in the cycle of trying to feel better you are not really free to function

5000778 wiesel was selected by the perpetrator because of his identity and the jury made it clear there were serious consequences
5000779 i think he was desperately delusional for the entire thing
5000780 the chronology of this event shows him spiraling deeper and deeper into an obsessive depression
5000781 i think the jury had it right where they said we dont believe he was trying to kidnap him
5000782 theres an anxiety as survivors dwindle and there are fewer living testimonials that the message will be lost
5000783 this was a psychiatric problem and i dont think any kind of criminal act

5000788 speaker pelosi is only willing to go a little ways down the road and weve got a long way to go
5000789 i want to welcome any reaction from her but i can assure you her proposal is not all that america needs its just a small part of it
5000790 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our

5000799 we have plans to expand the vermont mystic pie with other kinds of berries
5000800 the constraint was being able to go from harvest to processor with berries from the field

5000871 it just made me so much stronger and it made me the person i am today

5000899 wal mart has bullied its workers and managers for years now it wants to bully the political process and the fec should take threats very seriously
5000900 in an election season driven by the desire for change and a demand by working families for better jobs better wages pension security and health care for all americans it should come as no surprise that wal mart is weighing in heavily and possibly illegally with its employees over the choices they face this november
5000901 afraid to say we need a stronger labor movement in this country
5000902 tactics are designed to intimidate their employees and discourage them from considering choices that would strengthen their voices on the job and bring tangible change for all american workers
5000903 when the charity is great even the saint is suspicious
5000904 as far as im aware there is no association between headaches and the use of compact fluorescent lamps
5000905 the implications are that china will be the commercial leader of the world
5000906 it will also deserve and demand leadership in global institutions
5000907 we can model the economy and show that by 2035 it will be as big if not bigger than the united states economy will be at that time and by the middle of the century it will be twice the size of the u s economy at that time
5000908 whats happening right now is the world is moving beyond america the future is in many ways being shaped in distant places by foreign people
5000909 thats a big shift from a world in which america was at the center economically financially culturally militarily politically to a world in which there are more centers and many forces from india to china to brazil to south africa that have to be taken into account
5000910 this is not happening because america is failing or declining
5000911 its happening because the rest are rising and its happening because the natives have gotten good at capitalism
5000912 worldwide 179 countries are growing faster than we are as our manufacturing jobs have moved offshore the united states has counted on innovation to keep its edge but how much longer will that be possible
5000913 they have a medium and long term science and technology policy 2006 2020 and in that policy one of the statements one of the parts is to establish global brands with indigenous technology with chinese technology behind those brands
5000914 haier applies for two patents every single day every day of the year in fact its more than that
5000915 in asia were in the top ten the objective here in the u s is also to build a market share to be in the top three in the u s
5000916 its run by americans and it is staffed by americans it is owned by the chinese
5000917 weve been i mean really whacked in textile job loss we lost about 95 000 direct textile jobs in that process
5000918 capital goes to where its loved and we try to be very inviting on that front and not just in terms of tax policy and regulatory policy and other things but also in terms of direct relationship
5000919 thats happening at the local level in the united states
5000920 we need to change our tax policies change our immigration policy we made the u s a magnet an attractive place for the best and the brightest in the world and we frustrate that by saying you get a ph d here and that doesnt matter right now were throwing you out thats very self destructive behavior
5000921 we save too little we consume too much we borrow too much from the rest of the world we use energy in a profligate and wasteful fashion
5000922 i think that our window for policy change is very short
5000923 i think if we dont in the next few years four five years make the necessary adjustments what youll see is something that looks a little like the trajectory of the british empire in the 20th century its not that britain collapsed its that it just slowly faded away in significance in power and wealth
5000924 at one level a post american world is a sign of american failure and at another its a sign of glorious success
5000925 why is this happening because countries around the world are doing what weve been telling them to do for the last 60 years open yourself up to capitalism to free trade to technology
5000926 the sole breadwinner was out of work and it was truly catastrophic
5000927 today even if we had 25 percent unemployment it wouldnt be nearly as severe as it was then but we arent even close to those numbers
5000928 the big industrial cities were hit much harder and unemployment was as high as 70 to 80 percent
5000929 periods of difficulty can inspire creativity and during the 30s there were a lot of interesting innovations
5000930 for example the game monopoly was created during this time
5000931 back then people believed that the government should not get involved
5000932 they were concentrated on fighting wars not spending money to create jobs
5000933 between the new deal and the progressive era the country develops a new way of thinking about what government ought to be doing
5000934 there was a significant committment on the part of the government to improve the daily lives of people
5000935 they will do whatever is necessary to avoid a depression
5000936 the government will create jobs to repair infrastructure or other sectors the world has changed so much with respect to economic policy that it is hard to make a comparison
5000937 its hard to think of anyone who did well in the great depression
5000938 there were falling prices and deflation but today if you are in certain industries prices are going up
5000939 that means when the value of stocks go down you instantly lose everything you had
5000940 even if there are some similarities there are even more dissimilarities
5000941 and i grabbed it up and ran down the street to the store squeezing it in my hand
5000942 once i got to the store i just stared at the different kinds of candy behind the counter because i wanted the candy but i hated to turn loose of that penny
5000943 you hear all these highfalutin people on tv talking about a recession they dont know what a recession is
5000944 we didnt have anything back in those days but we didnt think about it because no one else had anything
5000945 we have actually had growth in the last two quarters
5000946 that doesnt mean that there arent problems out there with the price of energy the housing crisis and the unemployment rate
5000947 but it isnt even comparable to the great depression especially when you look at the unemployment rate most of the 1930s was just really bad
5000948 but my parents didnt lose any money because they didnt have nothing to lose
5000949 we never went hungry even if we just had potatoes and beans to eat
5000950 since we lived in jackson we couldnt grow anything but had to buy everything we ate
5000951 a lot of people talk about sewing clothes from fertilizer sacks but we didnt live on a farm so we didnt even have those
5000952 we didnt have any toys but we made our own fun
5000953 we used tops off fruit jars to make mud pies and played hide and seek and kick the can
5000954 i will never forget the name of his dog fala
5000955 and he would say all we have to fear is fear itself
5000956 i still pick up every penny i see because if you have 10 pennies you have a dime
5000957 we didnt have anything but a two eyed burner and some pots and pans
5000958 that is what is wrong with people today they want to go right to the top and buy these expensive homes no wonder they lose them
5000959 i dont like being inside if i dont have to
5000960 we grew up without air conditioning and i dont mind the sun
5000961 we did all the work while the farmer sat under the shade tree and then we gave him half the money for the crops
5000962 but i thought those were some wonderful times and i wouldnt mind going through them again we didnt know there was a depression because we didnt have any money to begin with
5000963 we bought sugar and flour and coffee from the store but this was pretty much all
5000964 we even raised our own corn and ground it for cornmeal
5000965 even if we didnt have anything else to eat in the winter we always had nuts and parched corn
5000966 people think they have these fancy t shirts nowadays but they didnt have nothing on us
5000967 our shirts would say tennessee rose or daybreak fertilizer with a picture of a rooster crowing on the back
5000968 we got in the field by the time we could see and stayed there until dark
5000969 i remember striking matches to look at the scales to see how much cotton we picked
5000970 the reason i know work dont kill people is because if it did id have been dead a long time ago
5000971 i knew the third grade books pretty well by that time but never could make it all the way through
5000972 if i had got to school more i would probably have been president or something
5000973 he would have five or six at a time but i never played with them that much
5000974 if we had it we had it but if we didnt we didnt and nobody threw a fit about it
5000975 even if we didnt have anything we always saw people who were poorer than we were
5000976 there was no such thing as welfare and neighbors helped each other out
5000977 if you look back over his record he really didnt do that much to help america and he brought in this whole welfare mess
5000978 i had worked really hard that spring and planted 12 acres of cotton
5000979 that was a lot of cotton for one man to take care of
5000980 i got more out of what i plowed up than what i gathered
5000981 we had a big family so we didnt have a lot of extras
5000982 we had a room that we used for our pretend games
5000983 we would pretend to be movie stars and act out movies
5000984 as the youngest i probably didnt have to do as much
5000985 my older brothers and sisters did a lot of the work
5000986 he didnt own his house and all his money was in the business
5000987 so he went down to the bank and gave them the key to his laundry business then he loaded the family up and went back to iuka miss
5000988 you didnt think about being poor because everyone else was poor
5000989 i hated picking bugs off the beans and sweet potatoes
5000990 you had to shake them into this can and let them die

5001007 but during the great depression they began using washers because they didnt have silver dollars

5001015 the indo us nuclear deal is important for indias energy security and i think swiss government will most likely support the waiver for new delhi at the nsg meet
5001016 the nuclear deal is good for india and it should be allowed to go through
5001017 it is a decision that has to be taken by the government the parliament has no role to play in it but i am confident that the government will take a favourable stand on the issue

5001041 billions and billions of tonnes of coal are today being mined around the world from china to india and the us more than ever before
5001042 it is completely wrong to say that coal is in decline or is a fuel of the past as in reality it has never been more in demand
5001043 the only thing is that the uk effectively no longer plays a part thanks to the mine closures initiated by the conservative governments in the 1980s and 1990s
5001044 environmentally the uk is today anti coal because of the perceived pollution and its pledges to better the kyoto global warming control targets
5001045 certainly it is better less polluting that coal is burnt in the uk than china
5001046 we can only support coal for electricity generation if it can become as clean as gas
5001047 at present we cannot support the existing coal fired power stations in the uk because they are so polluting and we are obviously totally against opencast mining
5001048 you will never be able to reopen the mines that were closed it is just not economically possible the cost would be astronomical

5001060 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5001061 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5001062 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5001063 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5001070 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable

5001122 when styling fonts with css you may be doing this font weight bold font style italic font variant small caps font size 1em line height 1 5em font family verdana sans serif theres no need though as you can use this css shorthand property font bold italic small caps 1em 1 5em verdana sans serif much better just a few of words of warning this css shorthand version will only work if youre specifying both the font size and the font family the font family command must always be at the very end of this shorthand command and font size must come directly before this also if you dont specify the font weight font style or font variant then these values will automatically default to a value of normal so do bear this in mind too
5001123 the box model hack2 is used to fix a rendering problem in pre ie 6 browsers on pc where by the border and padding are included in the width of an element as opposed to added on for example when specifying the dimensions of a container you might use the following css rule box width 100px border 5px padding 20px this css rule would be applied to this means that the total width of the box is 150px 100px width two 5px borders two 20px paddings in all browsers except pre ie 6 versions on pc in these browsers the total width would be just 100px with the padding and border widths being incorporated into this width the box model hack can be used to fix this but this can get really messy a simple alternative is to use this css box width 150px box div border 5px padding 20px and the new html would be perfect now the box width will always be 150px regardless of the browser
5001124 mijn man en ik hebben een jaar heerlijk geslapen maar daar gaan we niet lang meer van kunnen genieten de burgemeester mag dan wel beweren dat er van geluidsoverlast geen sprake was omwille van de uitstekende isolatie die bar cl s geniet maar heel de straat slaapt al jaren slecht omwille van het lawaai van wagens die de hele nacht op en af rijden en hun bestuurders die dan graag nog een praatje slaan die autos staan dan ook nog eens voor onze oprit of ergens op de rijbaan wanneer we zelf ons huis moeten verlaten
5001125 daar ben ik heel eerlijk in en zo heb ik het ook gezegd tegen mr wuyts en de burgmeester op een vergadering waarop heel de buurt in oktober van vorig werd uitgenodigd beschadigingen heb ik nooit vastgesteld niet n keer maar ik denk dat we gewoon geluk hebben dat we aan de voorkant van de dancing wonen hier is het goed verlicht en valt het meteen op als er iemand iets uitspookt maar de mensen wat verderop hadden regelmatig te maken met stukgemaakte brievenbussen en ondergeplaste schuttingen ik houd mijn hart vast voor hen wanneer alles weer van voor af aan begint je hebt daar dan ook nog een bushokje waar veel fuifgangers wat uithangen die nemen de bus niet hoor heel zeker weet ik niet wat daar gebeurt maar volgens mij worden er drugs en sterke drank verorberd e n keer zag ik er wel bloed om maar aan te tonen dat wat er gebeurt niet allemaal koosjer is
5001126 en om de geluidshinder te beperken zouden de mensen weg kunnen rijden langs de overkant via de oostmalsesteenweg ik weet zeker dat dat ons heel wat extra nachtrust zou opleveren
5001127 tz mi abbasso solo per farti vedere che stile e che bel cu o che ho
5001128 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5001129 elke vorm van snobisme keur ik af ik vereenzelvig me niet met luxe verre van maar ik verkoop wel graag iets dat mijn naam in een goed daglicht stelt ik breng schoenen aan de man van goede kwaliteit waarvoor je een prijs betaalt spijtig genoeg heeft ambiorix en dan vooral bij de jeugd een ouwbollig imago hun grootouders kochten bij ons en daarom krijg je het label not cool we hebben nochtans ook heel moderne schoenen
5001130 dat is eigenlijk heel simpel ambiorix heeft me gedurende mijn zwemcarri re altijd gesponsord na mijn afscheid zochten ze iemand als uithangbord en dan was ik een logische keuze de directeur vertelde me nadien dat de vertegenwoordiger voor vlaanderen was ontslagen omdat die bij de concurrentie was gaan solliciteren ik had ook andere aanbiedingen maar ambiorix was een vlaams product en had een goede naam
5001131 toen ik nog zwom wist ik een jaar op voorhand op welke dag en welk moment het allemaal moest gebeuren liep het op dat levensbelangrijke moment fout dan was heel mijn seizoen om zeep in mijn nieuwe beroep ligt dat helemaal anders nu reken ik in winter en zomerseizoenen verkoop ik in de winter wat minder dan tracht ik dat te compenseren in de zomer en omgekeerd e n kans om het hele zwemseizoen goed te maken tegenover een heel seizoen om alles in balans te krijgen dus de stressfactor is daarmee ook enorm gedaald financieel ben ik er wel op achteruit gegaan maar ik kom dan ook wel van de absolute zwemtop pas op ik klaag niet hoor ik word goed betaald je blijft ook geen olympisch kampioen tot je 60 h
5001132 jullie hebben wellicht al een hele tijd niets meer gegeten
5001133 moest er ooit een referendum gehouden worden over de splitsing van belgi dan zou ik me neutraal opstellen ik ben vlaming maar evenzeer belg mijn slaap zal ik er hoedanook niet voor laten zolang we er niet op achteruit gaan natuurlijk
5001134 te dikwijls heb ik verstek moeten laten gaan voor de gemeenteraadsvergadering omdat ik afspraken had voor ambiorix komt daar nog eens bij dat ik amper of geen vrijheid kreeg in het ventileren van mijn visie en idee n als nieuweling werd alles me voorgekauwd dat is echt niet mijn manier van werken ik zie zwart wit grijs ken ik niet dat moet je als politicus wel kennen hoe dan ook is mijn job prioritair ik moet mijn gezin kunnen onderhouden achteraf was ik blij dat ik er vanaf was
5001135 die had ik eerlijk gezegd niet er zijn veel gelijkenissen met mijn verleden als zwemmer ik begon niet met het vooruitzicht op olympisch goud ik ben er gewoon ingerold noem het maar een sneeuwbaleffect als politiek me ligt dan groei ik er wel in dacht ik je moet onder aan de ladder beginnen van vandaag op morgen word je geen eerste minister h maar ik merkte al snel dat het niet mijn ding was en dus stopte ik ermee
5001136 verontwaardigd was ik toen vorige week iemand mij hierover aansprak je gaat werk hebben kreeg ik te horen ik vind het eigenaardig dat de betrokken partijen hierover niets te horen kregen en dat ze zelfs onze mening niet hebben gevraagd moest ik dat nu twee maanden geleden al vernomen hebben dan was de situatie misschien helemaal anders geweest in december stop ik bij ambiorix en ga ik werken voor een bedrijf dat fitnesstoestellen verkoopt
5001137 mijn leven draait om uitdagingen ik ben wel stilaan uitgekeken op schoenen toch kwam het zowel voor de mensen van ambiorix als voor mezelf als een verrassing op een dag kreeg ik plots een aanbieding van een bedrijf hier in roeselare die locatie op zich is al heel aanlokkelijk maar omdat het een bedrijf is dat handelt in fitnesstoestellen denk ik dat mijn naam hier meer tot zijn recht zal komen ik wil terugkeren naar mijn roots ik blijf nog wel wat pr werk doen voor ambiorix zij hebben me tenslotte mijn eerste kans gegeven na mijn zwemcarri re en daar ben ik ze heel dankbaar voor
5001138 zeker wel maar dat is me ten eerste al nooit gevraagd en ten tweede ga ik dat nooit gratis doen ik heb twintig jaar quasi onbetaald gezwommen maar nu moet ik een gezin onderhouden dan blijft er weinig of geen tijd meer over om hier aan de rand van het bad te staan en dan nog het is niet omdat je een goede zwemmer was dat je automatisch een goede trainer zult zijn
5001139 schrijven kan ik niet enkel enorm uit mijn nek lullen lacht mijn vader heeft ooit wel dat idee gehad er was sprake van werken met rik lamoral voorzitter van de belgische beroepsbond van sportjournalisten nvdr maar de tijd ontbrak veel van wat ik meemaakte is heel moeilijk te verwoorden omdat buitenstaanders dat anders zullen ervaren daar heeft niemand iets aan misschien is dat wel een stukje van mezelf dat ik niet met jan en alleman wil delen
5001140 e n keer per week kom ik hier zwemmen met mijn kinderen maar dat doe ik enkel om hen een plezier te doen de goesting om in dat water te springen is er niet meer in het bad sta ik gewoon een half uur recht ik zwem zelfs geen honderd meter meer
5001141 neen het water spreekt me simpelweg niet meer aan wel moet ik bekennen dat ik ten tijde van die wedstrijd van het nieuwsblad terug aan het zwemmen was het was om mijn broer bj rn 33 een plezier te doen dat ik met hem trainde ik heb wat mee gezwommen en dat ging best goed op een dag kreeg ik telefoon van een journalist we hebben uit heel betrouwbare bron vernomen dat je terug gaat zwemmen vertelde hij vragend om bevestiging ik werd weer meteen onder druk gezet en heb de journalist verteld dat hij verkeerd ingelicht was
5001142 neen die hebben allebei hun gading al gevonden bartel voetbalt en merel doet aan atletiek op dit vlak volg ik het standpunt van mijn ouders ik mocht kiezen welke sport ik wilde beoefenen maar eens ik een keuze had gemaakt mocht ik daar niet van afwijken als bartel woensdag ging trainen en hij na afloop vroeg of hij donderdag met zijn zus mee naar de piste mocht dan antwoorde ik resoluut nee als je ze daarin laat doen dan hebben ze nog niets bereikt als ze twintig zijn en dan hebben ze ook de levensles om te leren beslissen niet meegekregen sport is een voorbereiding op het leven je gaat regelmatig op je bek enkel zo leer je winnen van hen die op zevenjarige leeftijd niets anders kennen dan winnen zul je niets meer horen als ze twintig zijn als ze dan pas beginnen verliezen dan kunnen ze dat niet verwerken omdat ze daar nooit mee hebben leren omgaan weet je ik vind het gewoon belangrijk dat mijn kinderen sporten omdat ze er veel van zullen leren voor in het latere leven en omdat het gezond is ik heb inspanningsastma en voor mij was het dus ook belangrijk om te gaan sporten zwemmen was daar heel goed voor volgens de dokter het zou mijn longinhoud vergroten en ik kan nu alleen maar zeggen dat het een uiterst effectieve manier is geweest om mijn astma te bestrijden
5001143 die heb ik al lang niet meer in mijn handen gehad ik heb ze aan mijn buurjongen gegeven thuis heb ik nog een elektrische en akoestische gitaar staan af en toe maakt bartel daar wel eens wat lawaai op maar dat is weer zo iets wat mijn drukke beroep opslorpte als je te veel hobbys hebt dan komt het na een tijd zo ver dat je niets nog goed doet ik denk niet dat het er nog van gaat komen je wordt ouder en je besteedt meer tijd aan werk en gezin tegenwoordig game ik met mijn kinderen we hebben een wii console spelcomputer van nintendo nvdr en dan ben ik thuis het kleinste kind lacht

5001204 hugo ch vez no promueve la igualdad sino el igualitarismo
5001205 esta oligarqu a enferma de aqu todav a me est atacando porque aprobamos unas leyes para qu son las leyes para igualarnos y vuelvo a tomar a bol var bol var dec a nosotros nacemos desiguales y luego vienen las leyes la educaci n la cultura la industria y nos coloca en condiciones de igualdad la igualdad la igualdad la igualdad para eso es el gobierno
5001206 no hay ning n indicio de que estas leyes cambien la estructura distributiva del pa s
5001207 la igualdad hace a los desiguales menos desiguales a trav s de las distintas pol ticas p blicas del gobierno el igualitarismo coloca a todo el mundo en un mismo rasero decidido arbitrariamente por un poder en este caso el gobierno
5001208 ch vez quiere castrar las posibilidades de aspirar del colectivo porque cualquier cosa que genere diferencia pluralidad lo considera subversivo pretende que todos nos conformemos con un m nimo de cosas que da el estado mercal barrio adentro alguna misi n educativa un carrito iran un cupo en d lares
5001209 socialismo significa justicia social e igualdad pero igualdad de derechos de oportunidades no de ingresos igualdad no es igualitarismo este en ltima instancia es tambi n una forma de explotaci n la del buen trabajador por el que no lo es o peor a n por el vago

5001211 todos tenemos un rasero independientemente del talento bolsitas de mercal un viaje social 400 d lares para compras por internet
5001212 defendamos no la igualdad de oportunidades defendamos la igualdad de condiciones
5001213 muchas de estas leyes sencillamente no se pueden aplicar solamente sirven para tener retaliaciones contra personas o empresas o en particular esa inaplicabilidad conlleva a que la defensa o ataque de las normas se haga sobre la base de categor as abstractas cuando el presidente habla de igualarnos a trav s de las leyes es porque la igualdad es un valor socialista y el gobierno se maneja con categor as que si bien satisfacen su est tica socialista tienen dificultades para aplicarlas
5001214 mucho menos va a funcionar en venezela donde hay ciertos valores como el progreso que forman parte de la conciencia colectiva
5001215 en abstracto los venezolanos quieren la igualdad piensan que los bienes deben estar mejor repartidos pero de all a decir que la idiosincrasia del venezolano es socialista hay un trecho muy grande cuando se les plantea que la forma de alcanzar la igualdad es siendo todos modestos casi muy pobres y que los m s adinerados deben repartir sus bienes entre quienes menos tienen empiezan los conflictos y el colectivo acciona en contra
5001216 el gobierno considera que est lanzando las bases para construir el modelo socialista y las va a ir desarrollando en la medida en que tenga fuerza si sale bien en noviembre con las elecciones de gobernadores y alcaldes avanzar m s en su aplicaci n ahorita seguir con su estrategia de trivializarlas para que pasen por debajo de la mesa pero si salen victoriosos en noviembre avanzar n en ese modelo de igualaci n en un solo rasero
5001217 hacer much simas leyes y cambiarlas en reiteradas oportunidades con el nico fin de ser discrecionales bajo un barniz de legalidad

5001308 i looked at a wiki community as a way to spread the news about my company since i felt that it was a local wiki my company was local it was a perfect fit it turned out to be stifling and full of people that were self serving it didnt promote any business and limited users abilities that is a stifling atmosphere and not conducive to rochesters economic downturn
5001309 i was going to create a scottsville wiki but when morelle came to me about having one for monroe county it seemed like a natural fit

5001393 when i turned up at west ham 18 months ago deano wasnt even training ive only seen him for the last 12 months but hes worked hard and done all that was asked of him
5001394 when you look at him hes a naturally big fellow but now much leaner people told him he should shed a little weight and maybe the penny has dropped
5001395 all i can say is were delighted hes got his first two goals for us this season and hopefully hell be back getting some more before long
5001396 with craig bellamy and kieron dyer still out the last thing we need is dean ashton having another setback
5001397 i was really pleased with my goals especially to get them so early
5001398 and the fact that they were the ones that won the match was really nice now well have to see what happens with the injury
5001399 im happy for crouch because now he can play more games its very important for him because its better
5001400 if a player plays only one game a month its not enough you lose the confidence this is very important for everything
5001401 i saw him in pre season against villarreal and he was fit enough
5001402 i never close the door to anyone i know him very well saw lots of his games last season and he is a very good player
5001403 you have to judge it on the size of the games you are playing and last season we were going for everything and every game was such a big game so the fact i managed to perform to my best was very satisfying
5001404 but you cant rest on that you want to improve and get better me personally i want to keep improving be successful and win more things
5001405 i think rooney can be both its possible to play like a second forward and score goals
5001406 he played very well in two games he didnt score but i was very happy with the performance
5001407 i afforded myself a smile before the game when i stood back looked at everything and thought were here
5001408 but weve got quite a level headed bunch of players here people like ian ashbee wont be getting carried away you can be sure of that
5001409 now weve got here we need to learn if we dont learn from these experiences theres no point us being here
5001410 its always interesting when new players come in and you see how they fit in with the players that are already here
5001411 but its like one big happy family here and everyone gets on well with each other
5001412 we did ourselves justice out there and showed a lot of character to come back
5001413 weve kept things as normal as possible during pre season and everyone seemed very relaxed before the game and then when the match started we went back to how we were last season
5001414 i think weve been quite clever with pre season this year and i think it definitely showed there today
5001415 paul konchesky is one of the best defenders in the league but there was always a chance of a defensive mistake as the match went on
5001416 i dont remember them having chance after chance but we didnt bring our midfielders into the game as much as we should have done in the second half
5001417 this could be seen as a reality check in terms of the result but the season ends in may
5001418 there are going to be 38 very very tough games
5001419 there is a long way to go all this proves is that there are no easy games in the premier league
5001420 they hull must be delighted with the performance but we will go home and lick our wounds
5001421 i will arrange for the voice rentals to be waived off against your bill as a permanent feature my local product team member has already been sounded off on this irrregularity in serving a customer please be assured that we shall get the matter sorted out hope you will bear with us and continue to be a part of the tata indicom family i shall get the waivers incorporated in your account and get back to you shortly

5001448 i came to tivo when we were still called teleworld and when we started off we grabbed off the shelf remotes these remotes had multiple rows and columns of keys and it was clear this wasnt going to work what we decided to do early on was make a remote that grabbed attention off the coffee table
5001449 it became obvious early on that to achieve the seamless trick play and control we were after for our new pvr dvr creation the remote must be comfortable for long periods of in hand use this and an iconic look were motivations for the more distinctive organic peanut shape
5001450 there were a lot of jokes about the shape not just the obvious ones
5001451 i can remember some referencing to an earlobe or the shape of the lower back butt area
5001452 number one get up from the desk and number two be ready to endure someone telling you in less than an ideal way that your baby stinks
5001453 the process was very very very frustrating and quite frankly i was surprised
5001454 using a bright color on remotes was not something that these companies did anything thing with character images on it the companies didnt want to use
5001455 weve toyed with other shapes in the background but always come back to the peanut the subtle shift from series 1 to series 2 allowed more free space between keys space for partner branding and improvements for manufacturability the shift to series 3 made refinements in key snap backlight fore aft directionality and balance
5001456 we set the ir emitter power fairly high on the early series 1 production remotes this had the effect of being able to control tivo from any number of off angle positions it also turned out that in some cases a user could even drape themselves and the remote completely in a blanket yet still blast through the blanket to control tivo
5001457 my team is working on a 10 year remote and were right on the cusp
5001458 it will be a permutation of the glo in a steel blue color
5001459 theres probably about two and half of us at any given time designing the next remote
5001460 let me just say were ping ponging the idea you wouldnt be disappointed
5001461 weve either given it thought or were in the process of prototyping it id say its a healthy combination of both never been done done before and whats been done well elsewhere
5001462 so you name it were thinking about but we are carefully at what we throw at it
5001463 always consider others as bandits yet respect the as rabban gamliel did

5001815 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
5001816 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
5001817 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
5001818 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave
5001819 it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
5001820 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
5001821 i suppose what im saying is both horses are very good dont get me wrong but to call them freaks and champions is very much premature
5001822 i believe the benchmark for champion status lays with makybe diva or sunline for that matter

5001824 well everyone in the world is entitled to an opinion and lee is no exception but the better news is that the horse ate up overnight and has come through the race beautifully
5001825 my son clinton took the horse for a walk this morning and came back and said i just wish he was running tomorrow because hes benefited so much for the hit out
5001826 he looks terrific and i think he is getting back to the old maldivian we all know
5001827 hes come out of the race with plenty of improvement to come but where i go is still up in the air

5001832 the back line is still quite settled without sos silvagni and everyone really stepped up today
5001833 what we did today was get some blokes back in form
5001834 i thought it was probably our best four quarter just disciplined do the right thing nothing fancy and just get the job done game that weve played
5001835 we beat a side inside the eight it doesnt happen very often
5001836 i thought that was probably our key to our game in that it was more a four quarter performance than what ive seen
5001837 i think weve won games this year where we have kicked eight goals or nine goals in a quarter and played a terrific patch and then gone missing for a patch of the game
5001838 we have won 15 games of footy so we are not going to crucify ourselves over one game of footy
5001839 richmond in my view hunted the footy had a lot more to play for than what we did early in the game and it showed on the scoreboard early
5001840 early in the game richmond were just harder and hungrier than what we were you can talk about our forwards until the cows come home but i think the clearances at one stage in the first quarter were 13 to 1 they were 10 2 at quarter time
5001841 if you watch the third quarter there were plenty of opportunities for us and we just butchered the footy with our use that was the period of the game where we really had richmond on the ropes
5001842 go to the stats and look at the kicking efficiency and see richmond are at 77 and we were at 69

5001875 seven of the 12 major partners have signed up for 2012
5001876 chinais unique because of its importance as a market for companies seeking to establish depth for their business butlondon is attractive to sponsors too
5001877 the tv deals with the us and europe for the 2012 games were done before i left
5001878 the rights fees paid represent a 40per cent increase on 2008
5001879 the ioc is putting the 2014 2016 bids from the usand europe into play now andis very keen to have them locked in before the decision is made on the host city for 2016 that decision will be made in october next year
5001880 the economic market is uncertain and 2016 is an awfully long way away and trends in the media tend to accelerate very quickly still interest in the us for 2016 is very strong
5001881 i think we have a very effective acquisitions process in our business
5001882 we truly understand the resources we are dealing with and the geographies we are dealing with we have an ability to focus on the right targets
5001883 im not predicting what well do tomorrow or a month from now
5001884 we can integrate them and turn them around and we do
5001885 where weve been involved in consolidation we have actually seen volumes increase weve seen more efficiencies brought to mines
5001886 i cant speak on behalf of steelmakers who invest in coking coal or pulverised coal assets
5001887 but if the view is that it is defensive in terms of pricing unless these operations are expanded and run efficiently it will have the opposite effect
5001888 were aware that there is an indication that there is a shortage right now of thermal coal in the market
5001889 and thats i guess supported by the fact that there are ships waiting offshore for coal which are not waiting necessarily because of the congested coal chain
5001890 we continue to call those sorts of prices we have seen now just as a floor to the market
5001891 you would have seen from some of our transactions that we pay value for what we see
5001892 so if at the time we said we couldnt agree on a number or we couldnt see value thats the reality of it at that point in time i think what has happened in the last year is we have seen shifts in economies we have seen shifts in exchange rates and the realm of what is possible in terms of pricing these commodities has expanded so our view going forward now remains fairly bullish
5001893 minimizing the time it takes to look up a needed phone number
5001894 minimizing the likelihood of calls being made by inadvertently hitting the keypad
5001895 minimizing the time it takes to dial a number without looking at the keypad

5001897 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion
5001898 the professional developers conference on october 27 and the windows hardware engineering conference the following week represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
5001899 and windows vista had driven client revenue to an average growth rate of 16 percent since it became generally available
5001900 the biggest problem vista has today is in perception a perceived lack of value and perceived instability
5001901 our 3g chips are for example used in samsung handsets and we are not aware of such problems there
5001902 historically apple does not respond to something like this automatically just because there are reports of problems if there is merit to the issue they work overtime to fix it and usually at the point of the fix that is when they respond
5001903 apple prides itself on its customer service reputation and i would be surprised if they dont go the extra mile to make sure anything that impacts that image will be corrected as fast as possible

5001912 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5001913 at that point rio tinto will ask themselves is independence still an option
5001914 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5001915 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5001916 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5001917 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization

5001919 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5001920 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5001921 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5001922 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5001923 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5001924 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5001925 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia

5001932 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5001933 the implications are that china will be the commercial leader of the world
5001934 it will also deserve and demand leadership in global institutions
5001935 we can model the economy and show that by 2035 it will be as big if not bigger than the united states economy will be at that time and by the middle of the century it will be twice the size of the u s economy at that time
5001936 whats happening right now is the world is moving beyond america the future is in many ways being shaped in distant places by foreign people
5001937 thats a big shift from a world in which america was at the center economically financially culturally militarily politically to a world in which there are more centers and many forces from india to china to brazil to south africa that have to be taken into account
5001938 this is not happening because america is failing or declining
5001939 its happening because the rest are rising and its happening because the natives have gotten good at capitalism
5001940 worldwide 179 countries are growing faster than we are as our manufacturing jobs have moved offshore the united states has counted on innovation to keep its edge but how much longer will that be possible
5001941 they have a medium and long term science and technology policy 2006 2020 and in that policy one of the statements one of the parts is to establish global brands with indigenous technology with chinese technology behind those brands
5001942 haier applies for two patents every single day every day of the year in fact its more than that

5001945 weve been i mean really whacked in textile job loss we lost about 95 000 direct textile jobs in that process
5001946 capital goes to where its loved and we try to be very inviting on that front and not just in terms of tax policy and regulatory policy and other things but also in terms of direct relationship
5001947 thats happening at the local level in the united states
5001948 we need to change our tax policies change our immigration policy we made the u s a magnet an attractive place for the best and the brightest in the world and we frustrate that by saying you get a ph d here and that doesnt matter right now were throwing you out thats very self destructive behavior
5001949 we save too little we consume too much we borrow too much from the rest of the world we use energy in a profligate and wasteful fashion
5001950 i think that our window for policy change is very short
5001951 i think if we dont in the next few years four five years make the necessary adjustments what youll see is something that looks a little like the trajectory of the british empire in the 20th century its not that britain collapsed its that it just slowly faded away in significance in power and wealth
5001952 at one level a post american world is a sign of american failure and at another its a sign of glorious success
5001953 why is this happening because countries around the world are doing what weve been telling them to do for the last 60 years open yourself up to capitalism to free trade to technology

5001965 george bush is not responsible for the 9 11 62 040 610 mostly white americans are
5001966 for white people to hold george bush accountable they would first have to hold themselves accountable their denial is the same type they express for the accountability they should have for slavery
5001967 white people have never had shame for the atrocities they have committed and continue to commit against the other peoples of the earth rather
5001968 their denial has its roots in a simple perversion classic american racial psychosis
5001969 for though they know their thinking is reprobate vile and evil they present themselves as moral
5001970 it is a game to them it is part of their concept of humanity it is part of who they are

5001972 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here

5002033 there are still strong forces within the government that would like to see a move away from commitments regarding industry policy and government support for the manufacturing sector
5002034 we need less policy less resolutions but more practical initiatives particularly where we can combine our resources and have a common position in regard to industry policy skills development and climate change
5002035 this package is capable of delivering the full suite of environmental flows within the system
5002036 despite this the cost associated with this package is high at 3 billion this cost is exclusively associated with the delivery of summer flows between eildon and goulburn weir
5002037 in the light of this the requirement for third party participation and the increase in energy use and system losses associated with an increase in on farm and regional storages it is possible that decision makers would elect to forgo the delivery of this flow component
5002038 include a number of broader catchment trends that may affect the capacity to achieve environmental flows such as climate change afforestation ground water extraction changes to irrigation management farm dams and bushfires
5002039 in general no formal methodologies have been developed for calculating losses under various flow regimes and catchment conditions the current state of knowledge regarding losses is generally inadequate for the operational planning of regulated releases to meet environmental flow recommendations
5002040 if people didnt leave valuables in their cars it would reduce the opportunities for thieves to steal
5002041 weve been through it with mobile phones and weve been through it with laptop computers and to some degree the public has started to heed the warnings about that

5002044 buyers reacted positively to speculation about a drop in interest rates by the reserve bank leading to an improvement in the clearance rate
5002045 they may not be out there bidding strongly yet but they are starting to think this is the end
5002046 buyers and sellers still seem to be sitting on the fence a bit it seems to be a given that the rba will reduce rates next month but the big question on everyones lips is will the banks pass on the full rate cut
5002047 there is a lot of stock about to hit the market in september and october and this rate cut would certainly be very pleasing and greeted warmly by people it will be the spark that we need for the rest of the year
5002048 for years the labor members for yan yean danielle green and eltham steve herbert have claimed they are against building a ring road but now we find their own party is in fact conducting research to ascertain whether the road has public support

5002055 we want to develop an objective system that could be applied by people with no clinical knowledge about depression
5002056 the latest research shows that depression starts at an early age so if its detected it will help a teenager understand their behaviour and learn how to deal with it
5002057 in clinical work the voice is often one of the first things you notice in depressed patients
5002058 i can tell with my patients on the phone sometimes after only a few words how they are going you can hear a flatness a tension coming through the voice changes very dramatically when they are depressed
5002059 it is a logical target for a diagnostic tool we are a long way away from having something thats clinically useful though
5002060 these workers are most anxious to stay here the employer knows it and the employer is in an incredibly powerful position in respect to these workers

5002068 given that we have no choice about being irradiated by masts and that most of the worlds population now uses cellphones our estimate is that this will be much much much bigger than tobacco
5002069 none of the recent reviews have concluded that exposure to radio frequency from mobile phones or their base stations causes any adverse health consequence
5002070 there is a concern in some scientist and activist communities that particular signals are more biologically active thirty expert reports say there is no scientific rationale to say that in fact handsets using newer technologies actually generate less power
5002071 studies over five to 10 years of use havent shown any increased risk the balance of evidence is that if we comply with who standards there is no scientific basis on which to believe there is any risk
5002072 we have observed this entire spectrum of illnesses around masts in johannesburg and also noted that symptoms improve as soon as people move away
5002073 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5002074 the methane comes out the front not the back we love the acronyms about what comes out the back but probably less than 2 5 comes from there its really a burp and breathe out tax
5002075 methane is a concentrated form of energy if there is some way that research could capture and redirect that energy back into production then both farmers and the environment can win thats the premise on which our research is based it must be profitable and practical to implement on the farm
5002076 our work is focusing on dietary supplements feeding the cattle to produce more milk profitably and reduce methane at the same time
5002077 a range of oils will work mineral vegetable oils it doesnt seem to matter what they are they all have an effect on methane
5002078 if any oil works we must look at oils that are a byproduct of another process

5002081 this is a very important week because there is a broad base of companies reporting
5002082 there are some companies that will provide a good guide those from the construction sector and retail sector will give an important insight into how things are going
5002083 i dont think we are going to see any surprises this week and that will allay a lot of fears by investors if we can get volatility down that will be the key because it has been holding the sharemarket back

5002110 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
5002111 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
5002112 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus obesity risk
5002113 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
5002114 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among preschool children the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it
5002115 we welcome the fact these are going on sale but it shows how desperate the public is
5002116 it cannot be a super suit and probably doesnt make a lot of difference
5002117 they are dirty and it should not be up to the public to safeguard themselves its the ethos of the hospital that needs to change

5002126 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5002127 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5002128 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5002129 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5002130 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5002131 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5002132 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5002133 a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant and a program of mass deportation
5002134 level of delusional affection for all things left among the liberal intellectual elites who take americas exclusive well being for granted

5002137 be very concerned when the term toil begins to show up in mainstream media and in the way culturalists and academics speak
5002138 soviet workers always toiled toil is a very potent word weapon in the lefts vocabulary arsenal
5002139 crisis is the condition that validates and sustains the leftist collectivist moral code
5002140 we lived through all that in soviet union there are derogatory names to call them but brown noser is the most polite ingratiating themselves with the chosen cult figure they hope to rise within the party structure and hold important positions of power it is power they crave the authority to tell you how to live and recognizing a cult figure they believe they can weasel their way into power
5002141 the chosen cult figure rarely has credentials other than a staggering sense of self entitlement and a powerful sense of destiny his followers are the same they recognize one another instinctually
5002142 yes it is america who is progressive the left is regressive america is different than all other nations america is progress for mankind the left and all like them are regressive naturally they have stolen the word and applied it to themselves this is how agitprop and symbolism work is why peoples cube makes you laugh
5002143 im still haunted by the horror i came to be a witness of
5002144 the subsequent blame america attitude among the intellectual trend setters enraged me liberalism no longer seemed laughable it was dangerous suicidal madness that had to be confronted i took up political activism
5002145 is self sustaining and self correcting the left whether democrats here or old soviet union deeply believe commerce must be managed but what they create is a system for themselves they cant help but create an economy to benefit themselves if the left gets control of economy it will be managed and re engineered to be corrupt is antithesis of capitalism the necessary condition and by product of capitalism is freedom is designed for people to take care of themselves regressive economic thinking is patterned to subvert freedom so corrupt enrich themselves at your expense you work and they grow fat capitalism is other way around you work you grow fat
5002146 i think you already stated that when you quoted me saying america is progress for mankind to answer your question id have to write a book and maybe some day i will

5002152 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced
5002153 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust

5002168 demand for commodities will remain at a high level in countries like china and india if we see a serious worldwide recession then we will see the end of the commodities boom
5002169 commodities cant be completely immune to the fact that there is a global slowdown taking place
5002170 that doesnt mean we should abandon commodities for the next five years there are still very strong supply demand dynamics in place for the next few years

5002173 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions

5002193 you should be especially concerned if your relative is diagnosed as
5002194 the goal of hospice care is to improve the quality of a patients last days by offering comfort and dignity
5002195 there comes a time in some cases where even nutrition and hydration are considered extraordinary means of prolonging life and such ordinary nutrients are discontinued the decision to withhold food and or fluids is made only when it is apparent to the caregivers and family that further prolongation of life would only extend discomfort
5002196 bio ethical support for withholding nutrition in those persons with advanced illness whose greatly impaired quality of life would not be improved but only prolonged
5002197 it is well known that hastening death is practiced and approved in many ways in contemporary terminal care when suffering is extreme and irremediable for example by terminal sedation by delivering pain relief sufficient to cause death by incidentally suppressing breathing or by withdrawing nutrition and hydration given the obligation to relieve suffering such practices are not incompatible with the physicians oaths
5002198 assisting suicide does not involve killing others or taking steps that cause or hasten their deaths suicides kill themselves assistance involves such things as giving would be suicides information about how to kill themselves enabling them to secure the means of doing so giving them realistic options interacting with them as they choose among their options assuring them that their choice will be respected supporting them emotionally once they have decided and protecting them from unwanted intervention the would be suicides themselves are entirely responsible for exercising the option and completing the act of killing themselves
5002199 terminal sedation is deliberately inducing and maintaining deep sleep but not deliberately causing death in very specific circumstances
5002200 overwhelming physical emotional or spiritual distress that is poorly relieved by other means
5002201 there are many cases in which patients experience refractory spiritual or emotional pain often referred to as existential suffering

5002259 the settlement looked over the river at the raw sparsely timbered opposite bank much had been cleared by 1829 including parts of the thick rainforest scrub a tangled mass of trees vines flowering creepers staghorns elkhorns towering scrub palms giant ferns beautiful and rare orchids and the wild passion flower that hugged the river edge from kurilpa point around to hill end cereal crops were grown in the cleared areas a low lying creek meandered through swampy ground around modern glenelg street to the river

5002261 it is little surprise then that the official gaze rested on south brisbane when a sustained program of government funded capital investment in the arts took shape in the 1970s and 1980s the wharves had been demolished many businesses had closed or moved elsewhere and the scattered light industry ad vacant lots that remained seemed ready for redevelopment the new arts precinct commenced with the design competition for the queensland art gallery on melbourne street in 1973 this was won by robin gibson and partners who proceeded to develop a conceptual design for the entire cultural centre precinct in the course of documentation and construction of the gallery completed 1982 the masterplan resulted in the queensland performing arts centre 1984 the queensland museum 1986 and the state library of queensland 1987 by which time the remainder of south brisbanes river frontage had been levelled for expo 88
5002262 the cultural centre precinct echoes an historical patterns first laid down in the 1820s by addressing the river directly emphasising the visual connections from the precinct across the river and vice versa its riverside walkways landscaped terraces pools and fountains underline this formal embrace of the river
5002263 in the design it was considered desirable to screen a hostile urban fabric of roofs and railways lines which occurs at the rear of the site and to create a building which when viewed from the city will be a series of heavily landscaped terraces which step up from the river edge and culminate in the environmental garden of the museum six stories above grey street the buildings will be kept low so that in terms of the townscape the complex when viewed from the city will maintain the profile of the mountain ranges and not interfere with the glorious silhouettes produced by the natural environment and the afternoon sunsets
5002264 at the raia conference two years ago timothy hill described in his elliptical way the difficulties his practice was having in realising this project having seen it now complete it is easy to see why a public client and large construction company may have had a tough time with this project it is a public building detailed in parts like residential project that this is part of its charm should be no suprise how often do you walk through the public domain of a building out onto a finely crafted timber balcony or handrail fixings that are made of seven interlocking components
5002265 this project well expresses its vast ambition to demand and excite public engagement
5002266 the design is all about creating an open space which unlike many public buildings of the past is neither intimidating nor conventional
5002267 hill says that the biggest compliment that could be made about his building is if people feel that its the kind of place they could meet for a date

5002270 internet use seems to create an information hunger and it is information savvy young people who are most likely to visit libraries
5002271 many canadian libraries are reporting increased patrons and higher lending figures while there are no national statistics the canadian urban libraries council which represents public libraries in cities with more than 100 000 people says circulation increased more than 25 per cent between 1996 and 2005 visits also went up by more than 20 per cent in the same period urban libraries renaissance in the internet age is partly because of a more service oriented culture argued linda cook director of the edmonton public library and president of the canadian library association
5002272 the patrons of that library like the patrons of all libraries are in transition
5002273 while graves slightly cartoonish stripped classicism lacks the self conscious gravitas of sterns design it sends a similar message knowledge is important like the other new downtown libraries the denver public library sends another message we are still here
5002274 retro ballparks have enjoyed success with the public but im not sure that trying to re create the library as monument has an equal appeal
5002275 seattles new library for example doesnt have a reading room at all instead rem koolhaas and joshua prince ramus of the office for metropolitan architecture have designed a single freewheeling space inside a giant multilevel greenhouse this is the library conceived as a drop in center filled with computer terminals magazine and newspaper racks lots of comfortable seats and yes even bookshelves like most modern libraries and unlike most traditional libraries the stacks are open to the public although as books become digitized this part of the building is likely to shrink the seattle public library has the rough urban chic of a converted loft when i visited the users were a mix of students tourists and street people many reading newspapers even more using the computer consoles very few in the stacks
5002276 ross dawson a business consultant who tracks different customs devices and institutions on what he calls an extinction timeline predicts that libraries will disappear in 2019 hes probably right as far as the function of the library as a civic monument or as a public repository for books is concerned on the other hand in its mutating role as urban hangout meeting place and arbiter of information the public library seems far from spent this has less to do with the digital world or the digital word than with the age old need for human contact
5002277 this raises an interesting question what sort of public library does the
5002278 our ambition is to redefine reinvent the library as an institution no longer exclusively dedicated to the book but as an information store where all media new and old are presented under a regime of new equalities in an age where information can be accessed anywhere it is the simultaneity of all media and the professionalism of their presentation and interaction that will make the library new technology is not a threat but it enables the realization of ancient ambitions totality completeness dissemination accessibility in any case the anticipation of a looming conflict between the real and the virtual is moot at the moment where the two can be made to coincide become each others mirror image the virtual can become the distributed presence of the new seattle public library that users find confirmed in its actual site in the city
5002279 the finest book of long distance mental travel that ive ever read

5002288 given all the new hair treatments out there theres a growing need to make hair feel more natural especially for women
5002289 for the first time we present an experimental setup that allows measuring the subtle forces both physical and chemical that arise when single hairs slide past each other or are pressed against each other
5002290 the findings will help provide clearer strategies for optimizing hair care products
5002291 the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair care products affect hair to hair interactions so that these products can be optimized in a more systematic fashion
5002292 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5002293 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5002294 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5002295 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5002296 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
5002297 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games
5002298 there was an explosion on the small beach of gualdalmar there was no damage

5002300 to make a woman march with the flag of the islamic republic in beijing is pure heresy and shows total disobedience of the laws mandated by our spiritual guides
5002301 to make this woman march means to openly declare war to our religious values whoever is responsible for this unforgivable act he should know that this gesture constitutes an obstacle for the appearance of mahdi

5002348 ive talked to asafa and although i dont believe there is a physical effect with testing there is a mental aspect
5002349 there is a minimal amount of blood taken but because you are taken out of training that can affect you he did not attend the flag waving opening ceremony he was taken away because of it its disturbing for him
5002350 with the emergence of usain over the past year i am not surprised that more tests have been conducted on jamaican athletes
5002351 we knew that wada the world anti doping agency and the ioc the international olympic committee wanted to clean up the sport
5002352 ive been tested after every final session and a few preliminary sessions ive been doing since i got here and in singapore and at the training camp in palo alto california
5002353 from the trials to now id say by a rough estimate theres been 40 tests thats a bunch but its part of the game and good for the sport to have it

5002372 when i worked for verizon i found the phrase going forward to be more sinister than annoying
5002373 my employers top half of ftse 100 recently informed staff that we are no longer allowed to use the phrase brain storm because it might have negative connotations associated with fits we must now take idea showers i think that says it all really
5002374 my favourite which i hear from the managers at the bank i work for is lets touch base about that offline i think it means have a private chat but i am still not sure
5002375 have you ever heard the term loop back which means go back to an associate and deal with them
5002376 we used to collect the jargon used in a list and award the person with the most at the end of the year the winner was a client manager with the classic you cant turn a tanker around with a speed boat change what second was we need a holistic cradle to grave approach whatever that is
5002377 until recently i had to suffer working for a manager who used phrases such as the idiotic ive got you in my radar in her speech letters and e mails once when i mentioned problems with the phone system she screamed no you dont have problems you have challenges at which point i almost lost the will to live
5002378 you can add challenge to the list problems are no longer considered problems they have morphed into challenges
5002379 business speak even supersedes itself and does so with silliness the shorthand for quick win is now low hanging fruit
5002380 the business speak that i abhor is pre prepare and forward planning is there any other kind of preparedness or planning
5002381 the one that really gets me is pre plan there is no such thing either you plan or you dont the new one which has got my goat is conversate widely used to describe a conversation i just wish people could learn to think outside the box although when they put us in cubes what do they expect
5002382 i work in one of those humble call centres for a bank apparently what were doing at the moment is sprinkling our magic along the way its a call centre not hogwarts
5002383 a pet hate is the utterly pointless expression in this space so instead of the perfectly adequate how can i help its how can i help in this space or the classic i heard on friday how can we help our customers in this space going forward i think i may have caught this expression at source as ive yet to hear it said outside my own working environment so im on a personal crusade to stamp it out before it starts infecting other city institutions wish me luck in this space
5002384 the one phrase that inspires a rage in me is
5002385 going forward is only half the phrase that gets up my nose all politicians seem to use the phrase go forward together we must we shall let us now go forward together it gives me a terrible mental image of the whole country linking arms and goose stepping in unison with the politicians out in front doing a straight armed salute is it just me
5002386 i am a financial journalist and am on a mission to remove words and phrases such as 360 degree thinking from existence
5002387 the latest thats stuck in my head is we are still optimistic things will feed through the sales and delivery pipeline ie we actually havent sold anything to anyone yet but maybe we will one day
5002388 i worked in pr for many years and often heard the most ludicrous phrases uttered by ceos and marketing managers one of the best was wed better not let the grass grow too long on this one to this day it still echoes in my ears and i giggle to myself whenever i think about it i cant help but think insecure business people use such phrases to cover up their inability for proper articulation
5002389 need to get all my ducks in a row now before the five year olds wake up
5002390 australians have started to use auspice as a verb instead of saying under the auspices of some people now say things like
5002391 my favourite weve got our fingers down the throat of the organisation of that nodule translation er no we sorted out the problems to cover your backside
5002392 the health service in wales is filled with managers who use this type of language as a substitute for original thought at meetings we play health speak bingo counting the key words lightens the tedium of meetings including most recently my door is open on this issue what does that mean
5002393 the business phrase i find most irritating is close of play which is only slightly worse than actioning something
5002394 here in the us we have the cringe worthy and also in addition then theres the ever eloquent where are we at so far i havent noticed the uks at the end of the day prefacing much over here thank heavens for small mercies
5002395 my least favourite business speak term is not enough bandwidth when an employee used this term to refuse an additional assignment i realised i was completely out of the loop
5002396 i once had a boss who said you cant have your cake and eat it so you have to step up to the plate and face the music it was in that moment i knew i had to resign before somebody got badly hurt by a pencil
5002397 capture your colleagues make sure everyone attends that risk management workshop compulsory common sense training for idiots
5002398 we too used to have daily paradigm shifts now we have stakeholders who must come to the party or be left out or whatever
5002399 i have taken to playing buzzword bingo when in meetings it certainly makes it more entertaining when i am feeding it back or should that be cascading at work
5002400 in my work environment its all cascading at the moment what they really mean is to communicate or disseminate information usually downwards what they dont seem to appreciate is that it sounds like were being weed on which we usually are
5002401 at a large media company where i once worked the head of human resources itself a weaselly neologism for personnel told us that she would be cascading down new information to staff what she meant was she was going to send them a memo it was one of the reasons i resigned that and the fact that the chief exec persisted on referring to the company as a really cool train set
5002402 working for an american corporation this years favourite word seems to be granularity meaning detail as in down to that level of granularity
5002403 on the wall of our office we have a large signed certificate signed by all the senior management team in which they solemnly promise to leverage their talents display and inspire unyielding integrity and lots of other pretentious buzz phrases like that clueless the lot of them
5002404 i was told id be living the values from now on by my employers at a conference the other week heres some modern language for them meh a shame as i strongly believe in much of what my employers aim to do i refuse to adopt the voluntary sectors client title of service user how is someone who wont so much as open the door to me using my service another case of using four syllables where one would do
5002405 business talk 2 0 is maddening meaningless patronising and i despise it
5002406 lately ive come across the strategic staircase what on earth is this ill tell you its office speak for a bit of a plan for the future its not moving on but moving up how strategic can a staircase really be a lot i suppose if you want to get to the top without climbing over all your colleagues
5002407 when a stock market is down why must we be told it is in negative territory
5002408 the particular phrase i love to hate is drill down which handily can be used either as an adverb verb combo or as a compound noun ie the next level drill down sometimes even in the same sentence a nice bit of multi tasking
5002409 thanks for the impactful article i especially appreciated the level of granularity a high altitude view often misses the siloed thinking typical of most businesses absent any scheme for incentivitising clear speech however im afraid were stuck with biz speak
5002410 it wouldnt do the pinstripers any harm to crack a smile and say what they really felt once in a while instead of trotting out such clinical platitudes of course a group of them may need to workshop it first wouldnt want to wrongside the demographic
5002411 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country
5002412 they should be ashamed and embarrassed for having printed it
5002413 this is not a freedom of speech issue this is newsday giving this woman a license to assault these fine men in print accusing them of complicity in murder
5002414 this decision was not based upon an analysis of the merits of the amended complaint
5002415 prepared a final version of that amended complaint that is 116 pages with approximately 200 pages of exhibits
5002416 the factual content of the amended complaint if filed would reflect major factual improvements that clearly document an enterprise a conspiracy and a large number of very specific acts by the defendant in furtherance of the conspiracy
5002417 despite the above factors arising out of this litigation but taking place or potentially having an effect outside of this litigation have led plaintiff reluctantly not to proceed

5002421 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government
5002422 once they have cleared it we will be presenting it as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5002423 president musharraf says he will not bow to these pressures will not quit and will defend himself
5002424 we want stability in the country we want political stability we want to make progress in the light of the mandate that has been given to our government
5002425 we welcome the release of any palestinian prisoner it is considered a victory for palestinians
5002426 we ask israeli to change its conditions for releasing prisoners and we ask for the release of all prisoners without exception
5002427 its fitting that rtnda chose to name its award for continuing coverage after ron
5002428 his longevity as news director is a metaphor for the importance of sticking with a story
5002429 on a personal note ron and i had been e mailing each other as recently as a couple of weeks ago i was trying to convince him to appear in a videotaped message for our next convention but although he preferred to remain on the sidelines of the broadcast industry i always knew he was watching

5002431 though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed says the lord who has compassion on you
5002432 i first loved you when dad and i began to talk about having a baby
5002433 then when i carried you in my tummy my love for you grew stronger
5002434 yes it did and when you were born and placed in my arms i loved you even more
5002435 did your love for me rub off a little the first time i did something wrong
5002436 not a chance there is nothing you could ever do that would make me stop loving you
5002437 long before you were ever born i determined to love you
5002438 well what about the bad things i do do they make you love me less
5002439 not a chance no sin is strong enough to deter my love for you

5002447 you know after we met the second time i got the most assured idea that i already knew your name i had no reason for it but i just couldnt help believing that your name was katerina in fact having become so certain of it i was afraid that i would just call you

5002680 we all know the problems with these kids in ayia napa and it is not just the boys the girls are just as bad i dont want to be branded racist because every time i complain to them directly im called anti semitic it is not worth it
5002681 but if we are going to clean up this town these anti social things must stop the biggest problems in my opinion are on tefkou anthea street it is very dangerous with the drunken boys on scooters
5002682 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5002683 our duty is to act decisively and make sure we understand what it is like to cope with rising food fuel and utility bills
5002684 if as a result of the current economic situation the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
5002685 yes protect those on the lowest incomes but also help the hard working middle classes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor the people who work long hours for their two holidays a year leisure club membership meals out with family and friends and ability to buy their children nice things
5002686 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens
5002687 russian armies cant march into other countries while russian shoppers carry on marching into selfridges
5002688 russia wants international recognition and respect we must make clear that the path it has chosen leads to isolation and contempt
5002689 david cameron is right to criticise russia but wrong to promise georgia early nato membership
5002690 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation with the lives of our servicemen and women
5002691 when david cameron matches his tough talk on expanding nato more quickly with a pledge to double defence spending or introduce military conscription perhaps then we could take him seriously
5002692 repeat offenders travelling from country to country and flagrantly avoiding the stringent sex offender mechanisms in the uk
5002693 the government must take immediate steps to develop bi lateral co operation agreements and joint investigations with other countries to return sex offenders to the uk and give clear guidance on when travel bans should be used to protect the worlds most vulnerable children
5002694 reverse the ideology that if abuse happens overseas then we should simply let the governments over there deal with it
5002695 this sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
5002696 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad
5002697 presently sex offenders have to notify police if they will be abroad for three days or more
5002698 we also recently signed the council of europes convention on the protection of children from sexual exploitation and abuse which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children and adopt similar standards of investigation
5002699 this is the first time in six months the dnc has stood up for the democratic process

5002719 i have to make a decision you will help me
5002720 long ago we came to earth to enslave your race we have succeeded even better than we had planned but now we must choose should we exterminate humans and move on or continue our domination

5002743 in the not too distant future you could fly from sydney to london and the trip would take three hours about the length of a decent in flight movie or the time taken to check in add a few more years and you could honeymoon in hotels in zero gravity or take a holiday to the moon

5002745 we have weakened the rule of law tortured innocent people fought a war of aggression destroyed our global reputation ruined our finances weakened our basis for economic prosperity and wounded our constitution

5002847 on paper this movie written and directed by brian de palma might seem to be just a political thriller but it has a rapt intensity that makes it unlike any other political thriller playing an adult his first and an intelligent one travolta has a vibrating physical sensitivity like that of a young brando and nancy allen who gives her role a flirty iridescence is equally vivid its as if de palma had finally understood what technique is for this is the first film he has made about the things that really matter to him its a great movie and probably the best of all american conspiracy movies

5002851 por ter sido minha primeira participa o ol mpica senti um pouco de nervosismo em alguns momentos mas nada que prejudicasse meu desempenho
5002852 para o futuro vou trabalhar melhor o meu lado emocional para n o ficar nervosa com a press o natural nos momentos decisivos
5002853 i gave everything i had but i just wasnt feeling great
5002854 i had just gotten 10th in the world on an off day this shows that i am now on a whole new level
5002855 you can make these up to one week in advance
5002856 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5002857 i feel more centered in who i am and what im doing i dont seem to have those self doubts like i used to have
5002858 brilliant colors and beautiful patterns just stunningly gorgeous more intense than normal reality
5002859 i feel much more grounded and that we are all connected there was this sense of relief and joy and ecstasy when my heart was opened
5002860 this is a truly remarkable finding rarely in psychological research do we see such persistently positive reports from a single event in a laboratory this gives credence to the claims that the mystical type experiences some people have during hallucinogen sessions may help patients suffering from cancer related anxiety or depression and may serve as a potential treatment for drug dependence
5002861 enormous fear and misinformation and a vested interest in exaggerated stories about drugs to keep prohibition alive
5002862 what was lost in all the derision and urban myths about lsd and other psychedelic compounds like ayahuasca peyote psilocybin and iboga plant medicines thousands of years old was the fact that they are miraculously powerful medicines with the ability to effectively treat and in some cases cure some of the most debilitating illnesses and disorders plaguing humanity addiction obsessive compulsive disorder post traumatic stress disorder and migraine and cluster headaches they are also effective palliatives for the sick and dying
5002863 western governments had to ask themselves what was more important to them their irrational and erroneous drug propaganda or the possibility that the millions of lives they had devasted by war violence and iniquitous economic policies might actually be repaired in this the seeds of a psychedelic renaissance were planted
5002864 well yeah when you put it like that sure i do i like it a whole lot
5002865 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
5002866 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease
5002867 pamela had lost hope she wasnt able to make plans for the future she wasnt able to engage the day as if she had a future left
5002868 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
5002869 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
5002870 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
5002871 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
5002872 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
5002873 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems
5002874 russo always credited the black panther party as being the most supportive organization behind his legal defense while on trial for the leak of the documents
5002875 the last thing she did was she started singing indian
5002876 in the end they tied sacks of marbles on her knees and forced her to scrub floors with a toothbrush on her knees that is why her knees swelled up when it rained
5002877 it justified all the bad things that were happening to indian people i knew we had to continue
5002878 i got up and spoke about the terrible conditions for american indian people
5002879 there was absolutely nothing to make our children feel good
5002880 today they are digging us up all over the western hemisphere they have never found a prison or a guillotine it must have been a great civilization they found out that indian people had no trace of alcohol
5002881 we chose to make that change by standing on our treaty rights
5002882 now indian people are making compacts with the states giving up treaty rights for casinos
5002883 we dont have to worry about the government anymore we are
5002884 they didnt give us nothing everything that white america got they got from us
5002885 as long as the rivers flow the grass grows and the sun shines
5002886 all the gold in fort knox comes from indian land
5002887 we got them off welfare rolls and put them on payrolls
5002888 we had to create our own institutions even today we can do that all across america
5002889 it is not a walk or run across america when the prayers are over
5002890 the creator is not going to help you unless you help yourself
5002891 there was a time when everything was done through prayer through a ceremony through a song
5002892 creator to watch over us and mother earth to provide for us
5002893 the american indian movement said we will never give up another
5002894 you just have to be who you are fight and struggle defend the treaty rights
5002895 we are still at war we are going to unite and we are going to work together to fight injustice
5002896 if you try to do something they will put you in jail you had better go talk to the warriors the sundancers
5002897 sterling went past everyone going five or six kilometers an hour faster than everyone else
5002898 it looked like he was shot out of a cannon
5002899 rahsaan came up to me and asked do you want to win
5002900 so i jumped on his wheel and kayle followed when i felt him slowing down coming into the second to last corner i punched out and went for it
5002901 i had confidence i could hold my speed and hit out
5002902 i also knew kayle was right there and could win if i didnt
5002903 the win tonight was good for the morale but were staying hungry
5002904 this was by no means our goal winning the national title is our no 1 goal
5002905 guys like matt wilson and ian macgregor really stepped up today because they want to be part of the team effort
5002906 it kind of shows the depth of this team we dont have the big superstar rider we just have a lot of guys that cling to one another
5002907 i sort of waited until the other guys started to pop
5002908 when i saw tom danielson was on the front and slowing down i thought what the heck and gave it a go
5002909 its going to be an interesting course with lots of corners on a race track

5002929 you cant expect me to support you from here on out unless you support this peace plank
5002930 inspired a wave of political enthusiasm like nothing seen in this country for decades
5002931 t here have been troubling signs that you are moving away from the core commitments shared by many who have supported your campaign toward a more cautious and centrist stance
5002932 if you win in november we will work to support your stands when we agree with you and to challenge them when we dont we look forward to an ongoing and constructive dialogue with you when you are elected president
5002933 look let me talk about the broader issue this whole notion that i am shifting to the center
5002934 the people who say this apparently havent been listening to me i believe in a whole lot of things that make me progressive and put me squarely in the democratic camp i believe in personal responsibility i also believe in faith thats not something new ive been talking about that for years so the notion that this is me trying to look centrist is not true
5002935 t he speech is actually directed at what obama calls my friends on the left i cant remember a presidential nominee specifically courting left wing voters and activists before honestly i really cant this is a sign of increased respect and being taken more seriously
5002936 we intend to join and engage with our brothers and sisters in the vast rainbow of social movements to come together in support of obamas unprecedented campaign and candidacy even though it is candidate centered there is no doubt that the campaign is a social movement one greater than the candidate himself ever imagined
5002937 formation of a progressive force within his coalition anything less could allow his eventual drift towards the right as the general election approaches it was the industrial strikes and radical organizers in the 1930s who pushed roosevelt to support the new deal and it will be the obama movement that makes it necessary and possible to end the war in iraq renew our economy with a populist emphasis and confront the challenge of global warming
5002938 to allow obama to pass for what he is not a progressive
5002939 seek green support against the claim of some that there are no real differences between obama and mccain
5002940 is there a field of actors formal organizations and or networks who are trying to mobilize people for collective action to challenge and change social political and economic inequalities of course sometimes they work in coalitions and sometimes they work independently do they always work together harmoniously with a common strategy of course not but that doesnt make them less of a progressive movement
5002941 but i would agree that there are movement elements within progressive politics today
5002942 still while referring to a progressive movement does give people a feeling of being part of something bigger its important that progressives have a sense of our own history and that we not throw around the term movement too loosely
5002943 i do feel connected to people and organizations that are working on particular issues on a local state or national level but that feels very different than being part of an overarching national movement
5002944 its a wish more than an accomplished fact to say that there is a single progressive movement there are movements plural some moving more vigorously than others insofar as there is a single movement its a reaction to the depredations of the bush years
5002945 i know every word of this and as i was singing i was back in time with it it seems totally familiar and fresh at the same time
5002946 they were the moral conscience of our society whether we liked it or not
5002947 i sit here today and look back at my life and it seems like were back where we were 40 years ago
5002948 in some ways it was very uplifting and in some ways very depressing
5002949 i was thinking of the young men and women dying in iraq and no one is saying anything
5002950 i was very angry if people didnt burn their draft cards
5002951 were responsible for it and if we want to stop it its our job
5002952 i feel its very relevant and very timely with the unrest and dissatisfaction with iraq
5002953 i cant relate to the vietnam war and im not very political
5002954 every one of the messages in hair is equally resonant today as in 1967
5002955 its all of these ideas that came out of a piece of history when there was huge possibility and huge potential
5002956 theyre taking concepts and much like the ziegfeld follies setting them in a revue type of situation with a narrative drawn through that isnt as clear as it would be in say oklahoma or gypsy
5002957 i got my mouth i got my teeth i got my tongue i got my chin i got my neck
5002958 its almost illegal how much fun were having on stage to be perfectly honest
5002959 its incredible everyone just loves each other and were truly like a tribe on and off the stage and we just go out there and have a blast and run out in the audience and throw our hair in peoples faces
5002960 the ultimate freedom to stand there and have no clothes on and be your true self
5002961 if there was any place to get naked it would certainly be in
5002962 so if i had the opportunity to i probably would the show is written so that claude is confused hes certainly not as free as everyone else is it would be wrong for him to get naked
5002963 i learned a lot about my role in spring awakening actually through doing hair because hair is so open and free with your body and lots of upbeat songs and lots of audience participation and spring awakening is so restricted and buttoned up and knickers and coats
5002964 this show has taught me so much about letting go and living moment to moment and enjoying where youre at when youre there and im really grateful for that
5002965 its really really really insane something is in the climate or the stars are aligning or something because its like all of this stuff from the late 60s keeps popping back up
5002966 hes talented and there he is working his butt off you know just so on it willing to try anything willing to do it again willing to rehearse more
5002967 never a moment of attitude from him about anything its just like kind of a deep place of something that hes working from a deep resource of energy and interest and its great because when you have someone like that it just spreads in the company
5002968 he loved the whole thing he had a blast his son was up on stage dancing with us after it was over it was really really fun
5002969 gliddy glup gloopy nieby nabby noopy la la la lo lo
5002970 i got my eyes i got my nose i got my mouth i got my teeth
5002971 the reason we werent terrorists is because we did not commit random acts of terrorism against people
5002972 ive never advocated terrorism never participated in it never defended it the u s government by contrast does it routinely and defends the use of it in its own cause consistently
5002973 with the time when there would be the most people in those buildings
5002974 dig it first they killed those pigs then they ate dinner in the same room with them they even shoved a fork into the victims stomach wild
5002975 kill all the rich people break up their cars and apartments bring the revolution home kill your parents
5002976 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflect on me and my values doesnt make much sense to me
5002977 but it remains both relevant and interesting that obama is friendly with an unrepentant terrorist who was involved in a movement that killed innocent people and that he even accepted donations from him to his campaign how many unrepentant communist terrorists do you have as friends how many politicians have such a donor even if the contribution was only 200
5002978 what sort of nominations does such a man make as president what
5002979 that is why these ties deserve scrutiny if barack obama becomes president his good judgment or lack thereof will affect the entire country
5002980 if the relationship with davis frank marshall davis mr obamas
5002981 with the exception of my family and a handful of public figures he
5002982 more likely the cryptic references to his communist mentor were and still are designed to protect mr obamas background from the scrutiny it deserves
5002983 focusing on legislation in areas previously unexplored by the african american community including his call that a person of color be appointed to the icc
5002984 is broken and needs to unite for the common good of the african american community
5002985 the problem right now is that we dont have a unified agenda thats enforced back in the community and is clearly articulated everybody tends to be lone agents in these situations
5002986 the black caucus is from different tribes different walks of life i dont expect all of the whites to vote alike why is it that all of us should walk alike talk alike and vote alike i was chosen by my constituents to represent them and that is what i try to do
5002987 while everyone agrees that the hispanic population has grown they cannot expand by taking african american seats
5002988 an incumbent african american legislator with a 90 percent district may feel good about his reelection chances but we as a community would probably be better off if we had two african american legislators with 60 percent each
5002989 there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian the united states of america
5002990 w ere all on the liberal wing of the democratic party
5002991 a s you combine a strong african american base with progressive white and latino voters i think it is a recipe for success in the primary and in the general election
5002992 when you combine an energized african american voter base and effective coalition building with other progressive sectors of the population we think we have a recipe for victory
5002993 working to block proposed legislation that would throw more juvenile offenders into the adult system
5002994 when white club owners along with israelis and russians dominated the ecstasy trade thats whom the cops were arresting
5002995 racial profiling may explain why incarceration rates are so high among young african americans law enforcement officials may be targeting blacks and other minorities as potential criminals and are using the vehicle code as a tool to stop and search them
5002996 it appears that official and public scrutiny of profiling behavior by police can lead to substantial reductions in arrests of minorities although this enforcement reduction may carry the unintended consequence of encouraging crime in minority areas

5003039 we analyzed lauers speech and movement and found them to be oddly wooden even for him

5003041 we believe the purported matt lauer figure on americans television screens during last fridays opening ceremonies was animated
5003042 if so this may be the biggest hoax in american media history
5003043 the point is ladies and gentleman that greed for lack of a better word is good
5003044 greed clarifies cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit
5003045 greed in all of its forms greed for life for money for love knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind
5003046 and greed you mark my words will not only save teldar paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the usa
5003047 the implications are that china will be the commercial leader of the world
5003048 it will also deserve and demand leadership in global institutions
5003049 we can model the economy and show that by 2035 it will be as big if not bigger than the united states economy will be at that time and by the middle of the century it will be twice the size of the u s economy at that time
5003050 whats happening right now is the world is moving beyond america the future is in many ways being shaped in distant places by foreign people
5003051 thats a big shift from a world in which america was at the center economically financially culturally militarily politically to a world in which there are more centers and many forces from india to china to brazil to south africa that have to be taken into account
5003052 this is not happening because america is failing or declining
5003053 its happening because the rest are rising and its happening because the natives have gotten good at capitalism
5003054 worldwide 179 countries are growing faster than we are as our manufacturing jobs have moved offshore the united states has counted on innovation to keep its edge but how much longer will that be possible
5003055 they have a medium and long term science and technology policy 2006 2020 and in that policy one of the statements one of the parts is to establish global brands with indigenous technology with chinese technology behind those brands
5003056 haier applies for two patents every single day every day of the year in fact its more than that
5003057 in asia were in the top ten the objective here in the u s is also to build a market share to be in the top three in the u s
5003058 its run by americans and it is staffed by americans it is owned by the chinese
5003059 weve been i mean really whacked in textile job loss we lost about 95 000 direct textile jobs in that process
5003060 capital goes to where its loved and we try to be very inviting on that front and not just in terms of tax policy and regulatory policy and other things but also in terms of direct relationship
5003061 thats happening at the local level in the united states
5003062 we need to change our tax policies change our immigration policy we made the u s a magnet an attractive place for the best and the brightest in the world and we frustrate that by saying you get a ph d here and that doesnt matter right now were throwing you out thats very self destructive behavior
5003063 we save too little we consume too much we borrow too much from the rest of the world we use energy in a profligate and wasteful fashion
5003064 i think that our window for policy change is very short
5003065 i think if we dont in the next few years four five years make the necessary adjustments what youll see is something that looks a little like the trajectory of the british empire in the 20th century its not that britain collapsed its that it just slowly faded away in significance in power and wealth
5003066 at one level a post american world is a sign of american failure and at another its a sign of glorious success
5003067 why is this happening because countries around the world are doing what weve been telling them to do for the last 60 years open yourself up to capitalism to free trade to technology
5003068 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5003069 we were the first in so well be the last out
5003070 i call for the opening without further delay of humanitarian corridors between south ossetia and the rest of georgia so that the dead who are still abandoned can receive a proper burial the wounded can be treated and people can rejoin their loved ones
5003071 this was an attempt to interfere with nascars post race inspection process and we are taking it very seriously

5003077 everyone hears what you say friends listen to what you say best friends listen to what you dont say
5003078 it was a significant enough section to cause us to take pause and look into what happened
5003079 nelli im so sorry to hear about your rough times but incredibly happy to have
5003080 will i agree i think this is a problem that must have some sort

5003082 yo trato de disuadirles esto no es est tica hago que se desnuden y se miren al espejo les mido son penes normales sanos que pueden satisfacer a cualquier mujer pero al igual que les pasa a las anor xicas que perciben su cuerpo distorsionado ellos se ven el falo peque o rid culo les afecta incluso en su rendimiento laboral hasta el punto de que muchos llegan f sica y mentalmente muy perjudicados
5003083 but those things which were profit to me i gave up for christ
5003084 das war ein ganz spezieller moment extrem unglaublich da musste ich erst einmal zu mir kommen
5003085 ich habe auf eine fahne gewartet aber es kam keine aber das war okay so konnte ich alles ganz in ruhe genie en
5003086 da bin ich in gedanken schon die sieger interviews durchgegangen aber ich habe es ja noch gut hinbekommen
5003087 stefan hat endg ltig die blockade aus dem kopf dass ein anderer schneller sein k nnte das war sein absolutes meisterst ck das hat er perfekt gemacht und das motorrad ist ein traum ich bin sicher das war nicht der letzte sieg
5003088 der durchbruch ist geschafft wie stefan sich behauptet hat war gnadenlos gut
5003089 der titel ist weg 60 punkte bei sechs rennen sind zu viel
5003090 aber in diesem jahr bleibt das ziel in jedem rennen aufs podium zu fahren und n chstes jahr wollen wir in der wm unter die ersten drei und vielleicht sogar weltmeister werden
5003091 das unterschiedliche k rperliche niveau der spieler hing auch damit zusammen dass wir im vergleich zur wm 2006 eine woche weniger vorbereitung hatten diese woche aber h tten wir gut gebrauchen k nnen wir m ssen jetzt mit der liga besprechen wie wir das im hinblick auf s dafrika verbessern k nnen
5003092 ob wir nicht wieder den einen oder anderen leistungstest einschieben k nnen die haben wir im vergangenen jahr aus zeitmangel gar nicht mehr durchgef hrt
5003093 ich wei dass das schwierig ist bei dem engen terminkalender der klubs aber wir m ssen dort den hebel ansetzen
5003094 alle spieler auf ein niveau zu bringen wir m ssen deshalb die k rperliche basis der spieler berdenken und ganz sicher auch verbessern
5003095 wir brauchen mehrere spieler die ein finale aufgrund ihrer klasse auch mal alleine entscheiden k nnen das ist eine frage der individuellen st rke und nicht immer eine frage der spielphilosophie oder des trainings
5003096 ich bin hoch motiviert und habe die m glichkeit ganz oben anzugreifen
5003097 ich habe unter der woche schon probleme gehabt durch die belastung des spiels sind die beschwerden wieder aufgetreten in absprache mit joachim l w haben wir uns daf r entschieden dass ich kein risiko eingehe und das regenerationsprogramm in bremen absolvieren soll
5003098 er ist ganz cool er kann nicht mal richtig feiern und ich bin schon besoffen
5003099 herr labbadia ihr deb t als bundesliga trainer endete mit einer 2 3 heimniederlage gegen borussia dortmund wie entt uscht sind sie
5003100 die entt uschung ist sehr sehr gro wir haben fu ballerisch berzeugt immer an uns geglaubt und zahlreiche chancen gehabt aber das ist alles makulatur wir haben null punkte das ist sehr sehr rgerlich wenn so ein aufwand nicht belohnt wird denn so gut kann man nicht immer spielen
5003101 w rden sie sagen dass ihre junge mannschaft lehrgeld gezahlt hat
5003102 wir haben eine sehr junge mannschaft aber das darf man nicht als ausrede benutzen daf r haben wir den fr hen r ckstand auch einfach zu gut weggesteckt wir haben nur manchmal die falsche wahl getroffen und das hat dortmund dreimal ausgenutzt
5003103 sie sind also mit der leistung zufrieden aber nicht mit dem ergebnis wie gehen sie nun mit der mannschaft um
5003104 man muss die mannschaft jetzt aufbauen aber das ist schwierig weil mir neun spieler fehlen die bei ihren nationalteams weilen ich pers nlich finde es sehr ungl cklich schon so fr h in der saison l nderspiele anzusetzen da sollte man auch mal ein bisschen an die trainer denken gerade in einem jahr wo die vorbereitung durch die em ohnehin sehr schwierig ist
5003105 constant djakpa hat defensiv manche schw chen gezeigt wir wollten ihn langsam aufbauen aber da uns v llig die alternativen fehlen mussten wir ihn ins kalte wasser werfen renato augusto hat mir sehr gut gefallen patrick helmes hat ein tor gemacht aber er h tte weitere machen k nnen normalerweise ist er eiskalt wenn er seine chancen heute besser nutzt gehen wir als sieger vom platz
5003106 sie mussten auf ihren verletzten stammtorwart rene adler verzichten wann ist er wieder fit
5003107 das beste trainingslager ist eine frau die eigene nat rlich
5003108 wir k nnen nie genug tun ich schaue erst nach zehn spieltagen auf die tabelle
5003109 es w re haarklauberei nach verbesserungsm glichkeiten zu suchen ich bin vor allem mit der spielweise meiner mannschaft zufrieden in der zweiten halbzeit haben wir eiskalt zugeschlagen wenn man bedenkt dass wir in der zweiten halbzeit ein durchschnittsalter von 22 jahren und ein paar zerquetschten auf dem platz hatten kann man nicht viel mehr erwarten
5003110 sie haben das erste mal als trainer gegen cottbus gewonnen zudem liegt ihre mannschaft gleich in der bundesligaspitze empfinden sie genugtuung
5003111 genugtuung gibt es bei uns nicht denn das wort kommt von
5003112 st rmer vedad ibisevic gelang ein doppelpack und bereite den treffer von demba ba vor wie beurteilen sie die leistung von ihm
5003113 er hat ein geiles spiel gemacht er hat momentan einen lauf und sieben von unseren letzten neun treffern erzielt das 3 0 als er den kopf in den schuss von selim teber h lt gelingt einem nur wenn man gut drauf ist
5003114 dieser sieg gibt uns r ckenwind und selbstvertrauen aber wir haben noch weitere 33 partien wir wollen weiterhin in jedem spiel alles tun um zu gewinnen n chste woche m ssen wir wieder beweisen dass unser kader richtig gut ist
5003115 wie haben sie ihrer jungen unerfahrenen mannschaft die nervosit t vor dem ersten auftritt in der h chsten deutschen spielklasse genommen
5003116 so untreu ich meinen sexualpartnern manchmal bin so treu bin ich dem fc st pauli
5003117 ja es ist alles gekl rt ich freue mich einfach riesig dass ich ab sofort hier f r den hamburger sv spiele
5003118 nat rlich ist es ein bisschen schade dass ich hamburg und den hsv verlasse
5003119 doch ich denke dass der wechsel die richtige entscheidung f r mich ist ich brauche spielpraxis um mich weiterzuentwickeln
5003120 auf die ganze mannschaft und auf den verein nat rlich auch auf j rgen klopp ich habe in mainz eine gute zeit mit ihm gehabt und ich glaube dass ich f r ihn auch in dortmund gut spielen werde
5003121 wir freuen uns dass der wechsel geklappt hat er hat sowohl in der bundesliga als auch in der nationalmannschaft seine klasse unter beweis gestellt
5003122 mit mladen kommt ein spieler zu uns der in der offensive variabel einsetzbar und zudem sehr torgef hrlich ist wir sind davon berzeugt dass er die qualit t der mannschaft steigern wird
5003123 e gira e gira il mondo e gira il mondo e giro te

5003145 i was not interested in making a record about the d word i got all that stuff out of my system on the last record 2005s pensive songs for silverman which was deliberately stoic this new album is really about me being free which is why it feels cathartic and expressive its about me coming back to being myself

5003156 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5003157 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans

5003192 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible
5003193 he doesnt get flustered and come unglued when something bad happens normally in a game something bad is going to happen
5003194 he has shown tremendous poise youre a rookie you come in here from college and youre playing tackle and youre moving to center and then youre right guard and then youre left guard youre going up against this defense and the multiplicity that they have were audibling were changing plays
5003195 there would be disappointment if he didnt do as well
5003196 we scouted him well some guys are robotic he just gets it dont send him to the hall of fame yet but for right now the arrow is pointing in the right direction
5003197 i know thats one of the things that separates people in the nfl how they are from the neck up im just trying to focus on that aspect a lot because everybody is physically talented so thats whats going to separate you from the next man
5003198 it will be nice to be out there and play a little bit and see if we can make improvements from last week
5003199 nelli im so sorry to hear about your rough times but incredibly happy to have
5003200 will i agree i think this is a problem that must have some sort
5003201 you tell me santa i thought you knew when we all were good or bad
5003202 im going to give you a chance to make everything right
5003203 one chance to show me if youre naughty or nice
5003204 because i told santa i had wet panties but i didnt show him i got greedy santa
5003205 im really sorry i guess i thought you wouldnt be able to hear me at the top of the house here
5003206 it wasnt a complaint or anything i mean its not a big deal and i really dont mind its just that
5003207 i think i might have been a little loud last night
5003208 i sort of forgot you were here staying with me once i got into the thick of it
5003209 i mean i quite like being loud too so its really not a problem i just thought i ought to tell you just in case youd rather i couldnt hear
5003210 i dont mind if you can hear me if youre sure it doesnt annoy you
5003211 well its the first time ive ever heard anyone you know doing it i mean ive seen a couple of films and stuff but just hollywood just pretend you know so that was the first time
5003212 i mean its not like you were hidden in the wardrobe taking photos or anything
5003213 i mean to be honest are you sure you dont mind me talking about this
5003214 no i dont mind you asking and yes yes i did come
5003215 you can listen whenever you want to i dont mind if it excites you
5003216 i dont mind you getting turned on if we talk about sex its normal
5003217 but much more of this and im gonna have to chuck you out of the room so i can see to myself
5003218 well alright maybe not throw you out but youd have to turn away and cover your ears for a bit
5003219 after youve listened to me what kind of deal is that
5003220 okay well maybe you could listen and then id throw you out
5003221 youd want to listen to me while i yknow while i masturbate
5003222 and would you watch would you want to watch me
5003223 i dont know why i did that i feel silly now
5003224 yes really please carry on i dont mind i want to watch you

5003230 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester it competes with charles de gaulle paris it competes with dubai now and with schiphol amsterdam because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of these airports actually has nothing to do with competition
5003231 all i want to do is take defenders on and see what happens i only scored five goals all last season so three in two is a dream start i just want to carry it on for as long as i can
5003232 it is early days and no one is getting carried away but we are up there now and we will be doing our best to stay there
5003233 it was an excellent team performance we didnt have one who played poorly
5003234 and to keep a clean sheet against one of the divisions biggest threats also showed we are on the right lines if we keep doing that we will win more games than we will lose it was a good days work
5003235 perhaps more embarrassing to prudently financial new labour are the ranks of tramps and malingerers who have escaped into ashworth to avoid working for a living demanding and receiving full board and full benefits of 100 per week pocket money for life we prison transfers receive only 25 being regarded as patients only for restrictions
5003236 cataracts ive had for 10 years are untreated as my visiting an outside hospital would again draw unwanted attention
5003237 quality background havent exercised in the open air since 1975 stopped all social visits since 1998 when ashworth became less than a prison confined to ward for past 23 years force fed since 1999 i a 70 year old tube fed skeleton am the sole high profile prisoner ashworth holds to exploit as a demonising agent
5003238 in like fashion new labour exploits the threat of a few fertiliser bombs to panic and heard a bovine generation
5003239 new labours disregard for human civil rights is now a general contagion with each infliction coated in a syrup of entirely cosmetic safeguards for swallowing
5003240 rightly has people complaining they cant safely walk the streets
5003241 the change in the therapeutic environment at ashworth since the late 1990s has led mr brady to wish to be transferred back to prison he wishes to be free from the power of psychiatrists under the mental health act including the power to artificially prolong his life by force feeding
5003242 we will likely see more insolvencies among small u s regional banks that have focused on mortgage business

5003244 only 9 of americans can speak their native language plus another language fluently as opposed to 53 of europeans only 44 of high school students are studying any foreign language and less than 1 percent study a critical need language
5003245 the state is saying were a partner in this its the opportunity to start using the resources
5003246 this can be so important to give a signal to the federal side for them to be involved and fund some of the efforts
5003247 i am not sure how much longer i will play for it depends on whether i get a new contract
5003248 i am getting onto the level four coaching course this winter i am coming to the end of my career so we will just see what happens
5003249 barring the boys playing for england at the minute i cant think of a better young bowler
5003250 i know i am a kent man pumping up my own team mate but from what we saw out there i would challenge people to name a better young bowler who would have bowled better out there
5003251 robert joseph is rare because there are not many bowlers in domestic one day cricket who are a threat in the middle overs of the game
5003252 just taking some time off and let it rest up
5003253 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5003254 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5003255 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5003256 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed

5003258 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5003259 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself
5003260 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
5003261 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due
5003262 strong willed but sensitive wanting to please but not a pleaser
5003263 dreamers imagine not only the ideal but also the disaster
5003264 dreamers want you to be understanding of their moods however they are sometimes intolerant of other peoples moods
5003265 a dreamer sees everything that happens as if it is somehow related to the other persons intentions toward him
5003266 when they feel disliked dreamers are the most reactive of all children
5003267 some dreamers react to teasing with tears while others try to bully their way through difficult social situations
5003268 but we need to get off of this technology because we know that weve either reached or about to reach peak oil
5003269 we have taken the decision to withdraw the support from the state government
5003270 it also required the company to retain all the pension liabilities for current and former employees of the retail business which is unacceptable to the board
5003271 the president was writing checks to the georgians without knowing what he had in the bank
5003272 my instinct would be for john terry because he is the type of naturally courageous player who leads his team mates by example
5003273 but rio ferdinand so much more mature than five years ago would be a clever choice for another reason
5003274 you feel terry will give 100 percent whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances
5003275 but ferdinand might find an extra 10 percent in his game by being captain
5003276 ive noticed with ferdinand the bigger the stage the better he plays he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games
5003277 by giving ferdinand the responsibility of leading his country out you almost guarantee world class performances from him
5003278 i still remember the negative 5 3 2 that cost us last time we went to croatia this time lets not be intimidated by the opposition and play two strikers
5003279 for that to work in qualification it has to be tried against the czechs
5003280 if wayne rooney is still not 100 percent because of his virus maybe peter crouch and jermain defoe should be given a chance as club mates at portsmouth

5003284 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
5003285 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5003286 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
5003287 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
5003288 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region

5003302 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5003303 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5003304 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5003305 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5003306 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5003307 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system

5003315 we didnt move the ball we got totally stuffed offensively defensively we never slowed them down special teams never won the field position it was an ugly half to be honest

5003416 a qualitative review of the studies found a consistent and strong association between the exposure to fluoride and low iq
5003417 there have now been over 40 animal studies which show that fluoride can damage the brain and no less than 18 studies which show that fluoride lowers iq in children and only 2 that dont
5003418 its apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain
5003419 the weight of evidence thats on the table now says that on a precautionary basis we should stop this practice fluoridation
5003420 the canadian dental association says there is no evidence to support the claims that fluoride in drinking water can lead to lower iqs
5003421 the majority of dental professionals surveyed were unaware of the current understanding of fluorides predominant posteruptive mode of action
5003422 no child is or ever was fluoride deficient in fact the u s centers for disease control tells us that 1 3 of u s school children are fluoride overdosed causing dental fluorosis white spotted yellow brown and or pitted teeth its time to stop fluoridation

5003430 global businesses are very nervous they are more upbeat than they were in the spring but confidence is low and is fragile
5003431 tax rebate dollars supported economic growth in the us in the second quarter by the next fomc meeting on september 16 the fomc will have another months data for inflation employment and retail sales employment and retail sales should continue to show weakness and headline inflation will likely be considerably lower therefore the fed is firmly on hold
5003432 this commodities sell off which began in july and has continued into august also corresponds to the long term seasonal cycle in which prices for many commodities tend to bottom out in late summer before rebounding in the fall
5003433 a global recession is widely expected by fund managers as the credit crunch marks its first anniversary by mutating from a financial crisis into a world economic downturn according to merrill lynch
5003434 almost one quarter of the fund managers questioned by merrill in august for its monthly survey said the global economy was already in recession and almost half expect the world economy to contract over the next 12 months
5003435 however inflation fears are fading after the recent fall in oil prices
5003436 in an extraordinary reversal a net 18 of the surveys respondents said they expected global core inflation to fall over the next 12 months
5003437 fears about stagflation are starting to give way to fears that the global economy is in for a period of below trend growth and below trend inflation said david bowers of absolute strategy research and independent consultant to merrills fund managers surveys
5003438 mr bowers said it was crystal clear that fund managers did not believe analysts profit forecasts with a net 83 describing earnings estimates for the coming year as too high
5003439 but as the economic downturn spreads to europe and japan enthusiasm for us assets has been rediscovered by fund managers with 53 expecting the dollar to appreciate and 38 planning to overweight us equities over the next twelve months
5003440 the fall in oil prices has prompted a partial unwinding of the highly popular long energy short financials trade
5003441 it would be a serious mistake for the international community to regard the dramatic escalation of violence in georgia as just another flare up in the caucasus
5003442 the names of the flashpoints may be unfamiliar the territory remote and the dispute parochial but the battle under way will have important repercussions beyond the region
5003443 the outcome of the struggle will determine the course of russias relations with its neighbours will shape dmitri medvedevs presidency could alter the relationship between the kremlin and the west and crucially could decide the fate of caspian basin energy supplies
5003444 it was known that a serious confrontation had been building up
5003445 on paper the small georgian military is no match for the might of russia
5003446 russia has made clear in word and deed that it will do anything to prevent natos expansion on its western and southern flanks
5003447 america and britain are closely involved in providing military assistance to the georgians in the form of arms and training the support is aimed at encouraging the rise of georgia as an independent sovereign state
5003448 in short washington has responded to this financial crisis with a politically driven reactive approach
5003449 by perpetuating excess consumption low saving unrealistic goals of home ownership and moral hazards in financial markets this patchwork approach has the biggest flaw of all it does little to change bad behavior
5003450 if this crisis is anything it is a wake up call
5003451 the longer the united states sustained the unsustainable the more it believed in the perpetuity of its charmed existence
5003452 the fed has lowered the federal funds rate 325 basis points since september and set up various programs to support fragile financial markets according to the senior loan officer opinion survey despite these endeavors the credit crunch remains in place for the most part
5003453 the details of the survey show that the housing market which was the trigger for the current financial market crisis is unlikely to stage a rebound in the near term
5003454 on the business side the fraction of banks indicating they had tightened lending standards for small firms hit a new high see chart 6 at 65 3 while the percentage of banks reporting tighter conditions for large firms rose to 57 6 from 55 4 in the april survey
5003455 the logic of the credit squeeze is inexorable the latest data from banks and prices in the secondary credit market point to a much slower economy
5003456 the federal reserves survey of us banks senior lending officers came out with little fanfare this week
5003457 lending officers said they were continuing to tighten standards whether on credit cards prime mortgages consumer or business loans even though a strong majority of banks had done this in the second quarter that implies a squeeze on consumption and lower investment as the year goes on
5003458 a similar exercise by the european central bank polling lenders in the eurozone seemed a little less gloomy but only on the surface
5003459 the july headline and core inflation numbers were higher than expected however lower energy prices if sustained should begin to help cool inflation fears in addition core inflation will turn lower because the economy remains weak and companies are failing to pass through higher input costs
5003460 we have highlighted several times before that core cpi is likely at a cyclical peak inflation lags economic growth by several quarters and the economy continues to slow
5003461 the cpis rapid ascent in the past three months undoubtedly remains near the top of the list of concerns of the fomc
5003462 weve recently seen the greatest expansion of credit in history
5003463 the us and the economies of the free world run on credit
5003464 with credit being restricted a second and very serious danger surfaces that danger is asset deflation the very thought of asset deflation sends chills of fear up fed chief ben bernankes spine credit contraction asset deflation shades of the great depression
5003465 it will take a much deeper correction in oil prices some light at the end of the housing tunnel and a stabilization of employment trends to reverse the us consumer retrenchment
5003466 retail sales growth slowed in july led by dismal sales at auto dealers
5003467 the chart below shows the year on year growth rate for us gdp over the past 40 years along with the contribution from net exports in goods and services
5003468 delinquency rates on single family mortgages have reached their highest level on record the fed started tracking this statistic in 1991 dragging up the delinquency rate on all loans held by us banks
5003469 prime mortgages are starting to default at disturbingly high rates a development that threatens to slow any potential housing recovery
5003470 the delinquency rate for prime mortgages worth less than 417 000 was 2 44 in may compared with 1 38 a year earlier according to loanperformance
5003471 delinquencies jumped even more for prime loans of more than 417 000 so called jumbo loans they rose to 4 03 of outstanding loans in may compared with 1 11 a year earlier
5003472 and prime loans issued in 2007 are performing the worst of all failing at a rate nearly triple that of prime loans issued in 2006 according to loanperformance
5003473 the extent of how bad these loans are doing is very troubling said pat newport real estate economist with global insight a forecasting firm
5003474 prime loans are just the latest class of mortgages to suffer a spike in failure rates
5003475 banks losses from the us subprime crisis and the ensuing credit crunch crossed the 500 billion mark as writedowns spread to more asset types
5003476 the writedowns and credit losses at more than 100 of the worlds biggest banks and securities firms rose after ubs reported second quarter earnings today which included 6 billion of charges on subprime related assets
5003477 the international monetary fund in an april report estimated banks losses at 510 billion about half its forecast of 1 trillion for all companies predictions have crept up since then with new york university economist nouriel roubini predicting losses to reach 2 trillion
5003478 us stocks pulled ahead of brazil russia india and china this week for the first time in 2008 spurred by the federal reserves efforts to cut borrowing costs even as the biggest developing countries are raising theirs
5003479 the bombay stock exchanges sensex index dropped 25 in 2008 through yesterday chinas csi 300 index decreased 54 and russias benchmark rts index fell 21 brazils bovespa has lost 15 this year
5003480 the fashionable investment tactic of the past month buying bank stocks while selling energy companies could already have gone too far merrill lynch warned clients yesterday
5003481 in mid july hedge funds pension funds and other institutional investors dramatically reversed their enthusiasm for energy stocks and loathing for financials in an abrupt about turn that sent bank shares soaring and oil and gas companies sinking
5003482 but merrill said yesterday that the unwinding of the classic bet of the credit crunch may already have been overdone giving warning that banks across europe could still be forced to raise between 70 billion and 120 billion in new equity on top of the 120 billion already raised
5003483 what will be the likely impact on equity markets if the dominant global themes of the first six months of the year rising commodity prices inflation and interest rate fears and a weakening dollar continue to unravel in the second half
5003484 robert parkes equity strategist at hsbc says there has been a clear reversal in global sector performance between the first half of 2008 and the period from july 1 to date
5003485 the top five performers in the first half oil services industrial metals mining oil producers and chemicals have been the five worst in the second half
5003486 away from the likely path of commodity prices inflation interest rates and the dollar a theme likely to remain prominent is concern about the global growth outlook he says
5003487 it may be too early to get involved in cyclical sectors particularly on the consumer side
5003488 for eurozone companies with dollar exposure the negative impact from the exchange rate on earnings growth is likely to remain prominent in the third quarter before it fades in the fourth quarter and then turns positive as we move into 2009
5003489 since the s amp p 500 peaked on october 9th the index is down 17
5003490 after selling off 9 4 in the last two days of trading and 60 since its peak last october 16th the shanghai composite is now back to december 2006 levels i e below 2500
5003491 so today with oil and other commodity prices in determined decline shouldnt chinese equities be catching a break
5003492 russian equities have been excessively punished over the last couple of weeks and even allowing for a higher risk premium and more normal oil prices valuations look compelling says vladimir savov strategist at credit suisse
5003493 he notes the market has fallen to levels last seen in november 2006 but says there are material differences in the economy and valuations since then
5003494 russian gdp in 2006 was 986 billion compared to our expectation for 2008 of 1 644 billion he says
5003495 mr savov says investors have taken too conservative a view on russian market risk
5003496 goldman sachs group reversed course on its dollar forecast saying the greenback has bottomed as global growth weakens oil prices decline and the us trade balance improves
5003497 the us currency after reaching a 5 1 2 month high of 1
5003498 the dollar has gained 7 6 percent versus the euro since touching a record low in july as traders reduced bets that the european central bank will raise interest rates and crude oil tumbled
5003499 after over levered dollar shorts euro longs cover those positions much of the world will realize that the exploding us budget deficit and further financial system problems make the dollar an unattractive haven
5003500 with international tensions reaching a new level of intensity and the global financial system still under historic duress wed guess that the dollar rally could continue but it is a temporary technical reaction
5003501 for investors in precious metals this has been a harrowing time where portfolios have taken a beating
5003502 platinums upside acceleration was a warning that we were on the cusp of a medium term correction however the faster downward acceleration this week also indicates that we are swiftly approaching the lows for this reaction at fullermoney we continue to believe that precious metals are in a long term secular uptrend but given the technical deterioration investors will have to be patient before these metals can justify significantly higher levels however for investors unwilling to wait out the correction this is probably a bad time to sell considering how overextended the market is right now patient more risk tolerant investors may consider nibbling around current levels or more prudently wait for a clear upward dynamic which will signal that at least a short term floor has been reached
5003503 a war breaks out in the caucasus pitting russia against a close ally of the united states inflation reaches a new peak in the euro zone the cpi reaches the highest in britain since bank of england independence rampant inflation sweeps the developing world
5003504 yet gold crashes it has failed to deliver on its core promises as a safe haven and inflation hedge at least for now why
5003505 gold has fallen from 1030 an ounce in february to 807 today in london trading it has collapsed through key layers of technical support triggering automatic stop loss sales the goldman sachs short position that i have been observing with some curiosity has paid off
5003506 for gold bugs the unthinkable has now happened the metal has fallen through its 50 week moving average the key support line that has held solid through the seven year bull market this week is not over yet of course if gold recovers enough in coming days it could still close above the line
5003507 well my own view is that gold bugs should start looking very closely at something else the implosion of europe japan is in recession too
5003508 my guess is that political protest will mark the next phase of this drama
5003509 what we are about to see is a race to the bottom by the worlds major currencies as each tries to devalue against others in a beggar thy neighbour policy to shore up exports or indeed simply because they have to cut rates frantically to stave off the consequences of debt deleveraging and the risk of an outright slump
5003510 when that happens if it is not already happening it will become clear that the pillars of the global monetary system are unstable infested with the dry rot of excess debt
5003511 gold should soon find support despite the setback in crude oil prices and a steadier dollar
5003512 historically precious metals are highly correlated with the dollar negatively and oil prices positively as the oil strength and dollar weakness of the past year unwind gold has faced downward pressure
5003513 however several factors suggest that gold should soon find support and begin to edge higher in both absolute terms and relative to oil
5003514 in addition gold etf demand is recovering after a brief pullback and our model indicates that the fair value of gold is in the low 900 ounce zone and rising
5003515 finally gold tends to be less sensitive to a global economic slowdown than industrial metals or energy
5003516 faced with slowing global growth macro investors began dumping commodities and commodity related stocks with small and mid cap stocks hurt the most
5003517 the unwinding of the long energy short financials trade also has been a big driver of recent share price performance

5003679 asistimos a una revoluci n que est en marcha por la situaci n financiera internacional que si bien fue el motor del crecimiento ahora cambia de signo y se producen reestructuraciones de otros sectores en estados unidos y europa mientras cae el consumo
5003680 estados unidos fue hist ricamente un comprador de productos elaborados por el mundo la crisis interna har que tambi n salga a vender y lo mismo suceder en europa
5003681 cambia su estrategia y genera una presi n competitiva m s grande con nuevas localizaci n de inversiones y la apertura de nuevos espacios

5003683 una plataforma desde donde se eval en los pasos a seguir en momentos en lo que se observan una ca da en los vol menes de exportaci n como consecuencia de la falta de capacidad productiva de parte de las pymes
5003684 en este sentido la colaboraci n de los sectores privados debe ser fuerte y pensada a largo plazo esto no se resuelve con una medida sino con un plan estrat gico comercial
5003685 el tema del tipo de cambio es s lo una herramienta no constituye un camino a seguir para tomar decisiones yo tengo que saber hacia d nde voy
5003686 a veces nos enfrascamos en discusiones ideol gicas que serv an en otras situaciones hist ricas pero si nos mantenemos igual frente a un mundo en constante movimiento perdemos la posibilidad de ver lo que tenemos delante

5003715 president musharraf says he will not bow to these pressures will not quit and will defend himself
5003716 we want stability in the country we want political stability we want to make progress in the light of the mandate that has been given to our government
5003717 i think phelps is the greatest swimmer of all times hes talented and trains hard
5003718 i guess his success will reinforce the status of this sport in the olympic agenda
5003719 hes really a miracle i enjoyed seeing him smile every time he won gold
5003720 hes my idol because he has devoted himself to his ambitions
5003721 phelps would have ranked fifth on the gold medal table of the beijing olympics even if he represented a one man team
5003722 the phelps legend proves that human potentials are unlimited the olympic games are forever leading the human race to become faster higher and stronger so the beijing games are more than a spectacular opening ceremony they have posed more aggressive challenges to test our limits

5003737 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
5003738 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
5003739 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus obesity risk
5003740 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
5003741 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among preschool children the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it
5003742 the comments made by the visitors in these three articles were defamatory and i have also lodged a report against them as i want to find out who they are because i am going to sue each and every one of them under the sedition act he said
5003743 so i call upon the authorities to take action against him before he causes chaos in the country he said adding that such statements could have a misleading effect on the people

5003756 i feel that i am a good man even though i dont do all of the mitzvot commandments in the torah
5003757 what is the checklist to know whether one is actually good
5003758 what does feeling that i am good have to do with whether or not one is actually a good person
5003759 see i have set before you this day life and good death and evil
5003760 the wicked even in their own lives are considered dead
5003761 do not say because of my virtue that god brought me to occupy this land
5003762 man does not live by bread alone but by all that comes out of gods mouth
5003763 only that you remain in awe of god your lord so that you will follow all his paths and love him serving god your lord with all your heart and with all your soul you must keep gods commandments and decrees so that all good will be yours
5003764 and it shall be if you hearken to my commandments which i command you this day
5003765 and now israel what does god ask from you other than to fear him
5003766 well all that god really wants is that you fear him
5003767 fighting appears to have been concentrated in two neighborhoods while buildings in the rest of the city stood intact

5003776 the only reason she could do this is shes never been out of shape a day in her life she loves to train and be fit
5003777 i did this in sydney but i was 33 then
5003778 shes a model for me i must learn from her
5003779 if it helps anyone else out there who is in their middle aged years and they put off something they thought they couldnt do because they were too old or maybe thought that because they have children they cant balance what they want to do and be a parent then im absolutely thrilled
5003780 shes really taken the age factor out of the sport
5003781 i realized i shouldnt have filed by nails last night
5003782 he and i wrote the story together and unfortunately he couldnt be here to finish it with me

5003784 this year has been one of the hardest years of my life as well as one of the greatest years of my life
5003785 ill probably take a deep breath and it will all hit me im still on an emotional high
5003786 pozdnyakov is one of the greatest fencers of all time
5003787 i was really fortunate today to stick with the game plan that we developed nobody expected us to but we showed that we can work and do really well
5003788 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5003789 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5003790 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5003791 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5003792 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5003793 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5003794 this year has been one of the hardest years of my life as well as one of the greatest years of my life
5003795 ill probably take a deep breath and it will all hit me im still on an emotional high
5003796 pozdnyakov is one of the greatest fencers of all time
5003797 i was really fortunate today to stick with the game plan that we developed nobody expected us to but we showed that we can work and do really well
5003798 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
5003799 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
5003800 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
5003801 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
5003802 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago
5003803 i did this in sydney but i was 33 then
5003804 if it helps anyone else out there who is in their middle aged years and they put off something they thought they couldnt do because they were too old or maybe thought that because they have children they cant balance what they want to do and be a parent then im absolutely thrilled

5003808 and i have a list of school supplies i have to get her
5003809 i was falling asleep at meetings falling asleep while driving
5003810 i would snore stop breathing and then 20 to 30 seconds later i would start breathing again
5003811 data would now suggest that sleep apnea can cause high blood pressure and that the severity of the apnea determines how likely it is to cause high blood pressure
5003812 the main coronary artery was 95 percent closed in that one so i had an angioplasty and a stent
5003813 i knew my father had apnea my father died of a stroke at age 62 but i look at that and i wonder now if i had treated my apnea back at age 20 25 when the snoring and stopping of breathing started would it have impacted the coronary progress i dont know
5003814 my father had apnea and he snored like he sawed wood as everybody said nobody knew about apnea no one talked about it
5003815 theyve made restaurants put up signs that say no gambling no prostitution
5003816 one of my restaurant owner friends says im not going to put those up

5003838 we didnt even blink we kept going we believe in one another
5003839 our starting five you put that starting five anywhere in the world and were going to win
5003840 and you bring our backup five in and you put that five anywhere in the world and were going to win too its one of those situations where were just deep
5003841 go with both chrises and you throw in dwyane wade its unbelievable
5003842 his athletic ability his speed he looks like a rookie out there
5003843 i think our bench has been able to give our starters a lift because our starters have to be out there to start the game and sometimes other teams give them their best shot
5003844 we come in and give them a lift and then they come back in and blow it wide open for us in the third quarter
5003845 were all studs we come in the game with the same mentality the same confidence that we play with back with our nba teams when we come in we try to give them a lift
5003846 when we come off the bench we really try to come in with a lot of intensity especially on the defensive end
5003847 my instinct would be for john terry because he is the type of naturally courageous player who leads his team mates by example
5003848 but rio ferdinand so much more mature than five years ago would be a clever choice for another reason
5003849 you feel terry will give 100 percent whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances
5003850 but ferdinand might find an extra 10 percent in his game by being captain
5003851 ive noticed with ferdinand the bigger the stage the better he plays he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games
5003852 by giving ferdinand the responsibility of leading his country out you almost guarantee world class performances from him
5003853 i still remember the negative 5 3 2 that cost us last time we went to
5003854 for that to work in qualification it has to be tried against the czechs
5003855 we didnt even blink we kept going we believe in one another
5003856 our starting five you put that starting five anywhere in the world and were going to win
5003857 and you bring our backup five in and you put that five anywhere in the world and were going to win too its one of those situations where were just deep
5003858 go with both chrises and you throw in dwyane wade its unbelievable
5003859 his athletic ability his speed he looks like a rookie out there
5003860 i think our bench has been able to give our starters a lift because our starters have to be out there to start the game and sometimes other teams give them their best shot
5003861 we come in and give them a lift and then they come back in and blow it wide open for us in the third quarter
5003862 were all studs we come in the game with the same mentality the same confidence that we play with back with our nba teams when we come in we try to give them a lift
5003863 when we come off the bench we really try to come in with a lot of intensity especially on the defensive end
5003864 the starters they get our team going when we come in we want to be that second wave if the other team still has their starters in were bringing in fresh legs
5003865 of greatest concern was the clear identification of two new storages more than 10 kilometres of channels and clearing for irrigation that were neither started nor in place in june 2001
5003866 we used the latest commercially available satellite imagery capable of discriminating floodplain structures at a resolution of less than a metre
5003867 this satellite imagery until recently was only available for defence and intelligence but its resolution allows for much better analysis of the floodplain developments
5003868 if governments are going to be serious about their intentions to manage rivers sustainably and protect their flows they have to use the latest technology in their decision making
5003869 the extraction of flows from the paroo river for irrigation breaches the intention of the paroo river agreement
5003870 it is unclear whether or not this development has been referred to or assessed by the federal government

5003892 while i dont mean to cause jeanes family additional grief an attorneys first duty is to his client and jeane was very clear with me that if she was ever found dead of an apparent suicide i was to make sure that all the evidence was publicly disseminated so that it could be independently evaluated

5003920 the situation is better as it is raining in only some parts of the city whereas last week rain had made the traffic crawl on the delhi gurgaon expressway it took me three hours to reach the india gate from gurgaon

5003934 der arbeitsmarkt hat sich in den vergangenen zwei jahren so positiv entwickelt dass wir alte rekorde von ber f nf millionen arbeitslosen nicht mehr erreichen werden

5003936 ich sehe eine sp rbare abschw chung aber noch keinen absturz der deutschen wirtschaft der die bezeichnung rezession rechtfertigen w rde

5003947 if voices like mine are not heard in new delhi i will have no option but to resign from parliament
5003948 the government should talk to separatist hurriyat conferences coordination committee and the shri amarnath sangarsh samiti sass to resolve the issue
5003949 all have to move a step back and start thinking afresh to solve the row otherwise the unity of the state is at threat
5003950 the government should allow people to vent their anger but ask security forces to exhibit maximum restraint as they did in quelling jammu protests

5003956 oh yeah dont mistake me for the 200 or so that permanently follow the campaign around the country
5003957 they are really dedicated but shh they dont even get to meet obama
5003958 just look around i barely see any then theres me
5003959 most of the campaigners are between the ages of 25 35 really young you know
5003960 not a lot of people my age who are into obama theyre too scared and too resistant to a change thats so drastic
5003961 i said to myself wow this kids really onto something good here and i never looked back
5003962 you see what i mean theres a definite disconnection here kids these days just want to dance have fun and listen to music they dont have anything to fight for or really care about

5003976 nicht ewig in der ursachenforschung zu verharren sondern den blick nach vorne zu richten
5003977 the longest holiday i have had in the last few years was three days due to training now i can finally rest
5003978 i finally have a floor olympic medal even if it is silver i would have been more annoyed if it had been bronze
5003979 too much of a good thing can kill a person
5003980 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5003981 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5003982 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5003983 what i didnt understand then but what i understand now is why detectives and our parents looked at us like we were crazy when we matter of factly talked about our 15 year old prostitute friend as if we were telling them about her favorite color
5003984 its a great pity for the dundrod club who had put so much effort into the meeting however from early morning it had been expected that the meeting would be called off
5003985 there had been weather forecasts giving us a bit of hope but as the day went on it was obvious that we were whistling in the dark
5003986 under the current regulations we are unable to hold the meeting on sunday and so the ulster grand prix has been lost
5003987 its as bad as i have seen it i remember that day 20 odd years ago when joey dunlop and myself did two sighting laps but after that the stewards decided to race
5003988 we then had a warm up lap and joey said to me this race shouldnt go ahead lets see it we can stop it we made approaches but to no avail and as you know there was a death on the third lap
5003989 i still remember that day for i had taken an early lead to avoid the rest of the field its a great pity that today has happened but theres nothing one can do about it
5003990 i would have raced had the conditions relented but there was no way that was possible its a great pity for the promoters and the crowd many of them were still in the stands hoping for racing to start
5003991 it is all very sad but to be honest i wouldnt have raced in those conditions
5003992 i was prepared to race but obviously the visibility would have made this dodgy im shattered that the meeting has been abandoned for i was really looking forward to it
5003993 i would have raced but the conditions deteriorated so much that it was really impossible to start
5003994 we held off as long as possible but at the end of the day the weather beat us we tried every avenue and postponement possible and only made our decision to abandon at the last minute
5003995 this weather has been as bad as i have seen it in seven years as clerk of the course but lets get things in perspective during that time weve had two deaths and its more important that we dont race when conditions are impossible
5003996 we have suffered a heavy financial blow but hopefully our meetings with the government in the immediate future will help us regain some of our outlay we are beginning negotiations on monday
5003997 at the time of the abandonment it certainly wasnt raceable i would have gone on alright but it was obviously impossible to ride in such appalling weather its a real shame for all concerned
5003998 we fully support the ulster grand prixs decision to abandon the planned race programme due to the horrendous weather conditions
5003999 the safety of riders and spectators is paramount and the clerk of course cannot take any unnecessary risks we understand it is terribly disappointing for fans and competitors alike but we believe it was the best decision under difficult circumstances
5004000 the council are disappointed that the ulster grand prix had to be cancelled
5004001 the council commiserates with the dundrod club and will work with the club to see that the race is back at dundrod next year
5004002 my wifes scottish and all her family are big scotland fans
5004003 its going to be interesting to see where her loyalties lie on wednesday night
5004004 but ive told her she hasnt got a hope of getting a ticket off me unless she wants to sit in the northern ireland end and cheer us on
5004005 ill be playing for northern ireland and i want us to win scotland are simply another team that must be beaten in my eyes
5004006 yes i may have lived and worked in scotland for some time now but that doesnt mean i want anything less than a good performance and a northern ireland win at hampden
5004007 if that causes a few arguments then so be it
5004008 i want to win this match as much as any other
5004009 i dont buy into the idea that this is just a friendly and therefore doesnt really matter
5004010 it matters to me and im sure it matters to nigel worthington and every member of this squad
5004011 i think its important to set the right tone ahead of the qualifiers and it would be wonderful for team morale
5004012 slovakia next month is very important but i dont view this game any differently
5004013 ive played at hampden park on a few occcasions although they havent been overly memorable for me that would at least change if we managed to get a result on wednesday
5004014 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
5004015 i think whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a culture perspective to answer it with that specificity is above my pay grade
5004016 if i have to go to the gates of hell i will get osama bin laden and i will bring him to justice
5004017 im so proud of the way they performed against bath and the great thing from an ulster perspective is that so many of them could still be here in 10 years time
5004018 the number of guys playing who are under 22 is extraordinary i can never recall putting out a team as young as that
5004019 we had no fewer than 11 players wearing ulster jerseys for the first time
5004020 they also displayed huge character in coming back strongly after conceding two tries just before half time and that has to be a good omen for the season that lies ahead
5004021 its vital that these young players can now put their hands up for selection and put pressure on those international players who were sitting in the stand on friday night
5004022 there was a lot more counter attacking in this game than you would have had under the old laws
5004023 the introduction of an offside line five metres behind the scrum is a huge plus in that it offers far greater attacking opportunities
5004024 but ive still no idea why weve given the defensive line out such a massive advantage effectively its going to kill the line out
5004025 in future there will be no need for big towering second rows that have been an integral part of the game for so long

5004040 a mosquito will not get in the way of my preparation for the olympics games in beijing
5004041 i dont know what happened i cant explain what happened here this afternoon
5004042 i had done that exercise 15 or 20 times and everything had always gone well
5004043 i never imagined this could happen to me that is a routine ive been doing for years and it never went wrong
5004044 i am very sorry brazilians i should have won a medal
5004045 two days ago he successfully did that same routine during a training session so we decided to try it here
5004046 when youre young youre so hungry i think thats a big advantage
5004047 russians have done it won an olympic gold medal at my age and i figure man were just as tough as them if not tougher
5004048 u s coach kevin jackson said the olympics are a higher pedestal and americans tend to wrestle smarter and harder in them its a lot bigger to us than anything else
5004049 he works at a high pace that most people frankly dont understand
5004050 ive seen that kind of talent before but i havent seen the blend of the work ethic and talent
5004051 he made a decision either i can be like these guys or i can be somebody new a trendsetter i can blaze a new path whatever cheesy analogy you want to use
5004052 theres something there in that mentality that brings out the fight he didnt take the easy way out the road the woe is me mentality and that says a lot
5004053 there might be a boycott there might be an injury you might not want to wrestle im looking at it as its my first olympics but its also my last
5004054 this project for which the post has been sanctioned is fully funded by the national aids control society and the post has been sanctioned for every state
5004055 but if i am not wrong kerala should be the first state to go ahead with the appointment and once appointed the candidate would be a member of the committee of the ksacs
5004056 i myself know several people who are eligible for this post the biggest advantage in such a post with these specifications is that hiv aids is no longer considered as a stigma this shows that our society has matured
5004057 every individual in the society has to play his or her part to see that the stigma on hiv positive people is removed once and for all

5004090 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5004091 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5004092 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5004093 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5004094 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5004095 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5004096 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5004097 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5004098 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5004099 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5004100 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5004101 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5004102 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5004103 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5004104 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5004105 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5004106 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5004107 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5004109 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5004110 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5004111 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion

5004114 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5004115 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5004116 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5004117 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5004118 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5004119 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5004120 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5004121 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5004122 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5004123 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5004124 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5004125 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5004126 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados

5004129 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar

5004131 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5004132 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5004133 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5004134 goede actie van de politie want misschien lossen we op deze manier meer misdaden op

5004137 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5004138 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5004139 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5004140 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5004141 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5004142 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5004143 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente

5004150 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5004151 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5004152 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5004153 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5004154 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5004155 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5004156 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

5004160 what made this event very interesting is that the x ray signal was very weak and soft very different from a gamma ray burst and more in line with what is expected from a normal supernova
5004161 since the masses and energies involved are smaller than in every known gamma ray burst related supernova we think that the collapse of the star gave rise to a weak jet and that the presence of the helium layer made it even more difficult for the jet to remain collimated so that when it emerged from the stellar surface the x ray signal was weak

5004176 what the church is for rather than what it is against
5004177 spend more time talking about issues that matter to evangelical voters
5004178 drive the issue of abortion like a wedge into the soul of the nation
5004179 this is a different kind of christianity we know that obama will appoint judges that will throw the doors open to the kind of freedom that is not founded in the scriptures
5004180 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
5004181 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
5004182 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
5004183 these dangerous proposals have no business being on the ballot
5004184 we cannot stand by and let jeb bush and his cronies succeed in manipulating and misleading floridians
5004185 helping the homeless is certainly laudable but government officials must not violate basic constitutional mandates in the process it is wrong for the city to subsidize religious worship and evangelism
5004186 we recognize that central union mission has done a great deal of good for the homeless and the hungry throughout its history
5004187 we also realize that the district faces considerable difficulties in addressing the needs of the homeless and that debates over the future of the mission and other city shelters have already generated a substantial amount of controversy but violating the constitution and d c law is no answer to the districts problems
5004188 campaign 2008 is starting to feel like a sunday school bible drill
5004189 were electing a president not a national pastor i dont see what good it will do for the american people to again hear the candidates spout pious platitudes about their favorite bible verses or how devout they are
5004190 candidates should appeal to the voters based on their qualifications for office and their stands on the issues not their religious beliefs
5004191 this event continues the campaign spiral into religious matters americans want to hear the candidates views on important issues such as constitutional rights public education the iraq war and the economy
5004192 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country
5004193 that jersey got more action than the rest of us put together well except for joe
5004194 that will start up the two dynamips processes and the last one double click in the
5004195 you will need to have a cco account with cisco in order to download an image sorry guys but i cant help anybody at this point
5004196 its cool that i have this bottle of alcohol in my hand i just turned 21
5004197 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
5004198 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
5004199 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
5004200 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
5004201 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
5004202 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
5004203 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
5004204 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
5004205 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
5004206 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
5004207 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
5004208 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
5004209 we knew it was important that we come out hard in the first five minutes
5004210 this is tremendously important work since black holes can be elusive and there are only a couple of ways to weigh them accurately
5004211 its reassuring that two very different ways to measure the mass of a big black hole give such similar answers
5004212 it was wonderful to finally see convincing evidence of the effects of the huge black hole that we expected
5004213 we were thrilled that our new technique worked just as well as the more traditional approach for weighing the black hole
5004214 monster black holes like this one power spectacular light shows in the distant early universe but not in the local universe
5004215 so we cant wait to apply our new method to other nearby galaxies harboring such inconspicuous black holes
5004216 if you are to truly understand then you will need the contrast not adherence to a single ideal

5004228 i will stare the sun down untill my eyes go blind
5004229 did i ask to much more then alot you gave me nothing now its all ive got
5004230 are we going to just stand around with our thumbs up our ass or are we going to play some rummy

5004234 i want you to notice when im not around your so very special i wish i was special
5004235 i put your picture away i wonder where you have been
5004236 he who loves shall reach utopia who loves me will enter utopia
5004237 we are far more liable to catch the vices than the virtues of our associates

5004239 its way to peppery and you wouldnt even serve it to a fuckin pig
5004240 everytime i ask you a sensible question you give me a dumb blonde answer yes
5004241 the crab is off its fuckin rancid youll kill somebody
5004242 if you shut the fuck up for thirty seconds you might actually learn something
5004243 now theres a look in your eyes like black holes in the sky
5004244 in a world we need to share its not enough to stand and stare
5004245 the memories of a man in his old age are the deeds of a man in his prime
5004246 if you wanna find out whats behind these cold eyes youll just have to claw your way through this disguise
5004247 people come people go some grow young some grow cold
5004248 think shes kinda neat then she tells me im a creep friends dont mean a thing guess ill leave it up to me
5004249 i rolled on as the sky grew dark i put the pedal down to make some time theres something good waiting down this road im pickin up whatevers mine
5004250 long you live and high you fly and smiles youll give and tears youll cry
5004251 cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes inviting and inciting me to rise
5004252 as i grow to udnerstand life less and less i learn to love it more and more

5004327 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5004328 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5004329 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5004330 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5004331 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5004332 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5004333 os ltimos dias do meu av foram muito dif ceis porque minha av que ligava para ele todos os dias parou de ligar e ele percebeu que alguma coisa havia acontecido n s decidimos n o contar para ele sobre o coma
5004334 apesar de passar pelos tratamentos nunca disseram para ele que era c ncer ele dizia que n o queria saber o que era era uma atitude
5004335 o ataque come ou s 23 53 da noite de 5 feira 7 com disparos de sistemas
5004336 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
5004337 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
5004338 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
5004339 eu os vi na tv eles s o muito fofos
5004340 estou s esperando para abra los e amament los n o sei se poderei fazer isso com todos mas tentarei
5004341 eles est o indo bem mas ainda precisam de muito cuidado
5004342 give you a full screen preview of all of your desktops
5004343 please accept my resignation i dont care to belong to any club that will accept me as a member
5004344 i love deadlines i like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by
5004345 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5004346 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5004347 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5004348 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5004349 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5004350 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5004351 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5004352 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5004353 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5004354 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5004355 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5004356 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5004357 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5004358 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5004359 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5004360 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5004361 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5004362 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5004363 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5004364 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5004365 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5004366 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5004367 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5004368 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5004369 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

5004371 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5004372 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5004373 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5004374 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5004375 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5004376 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5004377 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5004378 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5004379 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5004380 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5004381 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5004382 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5004383 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5004384 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5004385 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5004386 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5004387 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5004388 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5004389 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5004390 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5004391 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5004392 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5004393 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5004401 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5004402 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5004403 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5004404 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5004405 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5004406 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5004407 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5004408 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5004409 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5004410 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5004411 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5004412 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5004413 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5004414 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5004415 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy

5004442 what florida residents would hope for is that the storm stays over land as much as possible but right now the forecast doesnt call for that
5004443 i hate to say major hurricane because the forecast is so uncertain but you folks need to be prepared
5004444 they should top off their vehicles with fuel make sure they have the supplies they need
5004445 tropical storm fay is expected to roll through the florida keys on monday as a category 1 or 2 hurricane and is then likely to intensify possibly making landfall as a major hurricane on the southwest florida coast tuesday or wednesday federal forecasters said

5004447 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
5004448 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
5004449 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5004450 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
5004451 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
5004452 if youre just talking about income how about five million
5004453 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
5004454 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
5004455 i wanted to know that i would have the ability to call the shots
5004456 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision
5004457 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush

5004461 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5004462 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5004463 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5004464 the worlds youth have a huge personal stake in global warming
5004465 after all it is our future that hangs in the balance the inconvenient youth network will give a voice to the many youth around the world who want to make difference now
5004466 we believe the climate change problem can be solved and youth will make a difference this group of 80 trainees will tap into their local communities and quickly grow to a network of over a thousand youth were already working to schedule sessions at campuses across the nation
5004467 were going beyond facebook to get this issue in the face of adults and other teens together we can solve it
5004468 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
5004469 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
5004470 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
5004471 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
5004472 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
5004473 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
5004474 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5004475 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5004476 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites

5004479 we went out in the first half pumped up because we were ready for this game we led at halftime 1 0
5004480 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5004481 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5004482 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5004483 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
5004484 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
5004485 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5004486 due to the frequency and amount of fuel stolen within a short period of time we believe the suspect was siphoning the petrol out once obtained
5004487 there have been no arrests to date and the car is currently undergoing forensic examination
5004488 these criminals mainly use the fuel stations as they move between their other crimes
5004489 they are unlikely to have tax or insurance and their vehicles could very well be stolen
5004490 habitual forecourt thieves are often the visible tip of a far larger crime iceberg
5004491 we want to focus our efforts in bromley in the future to help reduce the forecourt crime figures
5004492 she has already done 188 000 miles if the engine goes ill just replace it

5004499 teams will then be able to use their greasemarks to buy oil from each other every evening
5004500 teams that have done well finding fat along the route will make a killing at the expense of teams that havent been so lucky
5004501 the winner of the golden lard award will be the fat cats with the most greasemarks at the end of the trip

5004518 a lot of bands and artists feel that its hard to get any interest from record labels due to the state most labels are in they all seem to be playing it very safe
5004519 a lot of people think its impossible to have a successful music career without a label but theres a lot of talented bands and artists out there who just havent been lucky enough to get the breaks
5004520 we always believed that it is for the public to decide so often the labels get it wrong
5004521 we arent some faceless major contact us for a chat and well see how we can help
5004522 we have all seen devastating pictures of abuse starvation homeless effects of war but never have been unified with music in a way until now that reaches the listeners core level creating feelings that pictures alone cant and that allows for the proper contribution
5004523 to unite people across the globe with music to take action to create a better world so future generations will have a planet worth inheriting
5004524 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
5004525 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county

5004531 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5004532 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5004533 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5004534 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5004535 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5004536 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true

5004590 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
5004591 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5004592 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5004593 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
5004594 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
5004595 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule

5004608 it doesnt matter who youre playing north team south team pick your poison they are going to be good i was blessed to see pretty good teams over the years but is one division better than the other you know they are all good

5004647 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5004648 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5004649 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5004650 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000

5004729 i read it quite a few years ago and its still on my bookshelf its one of those books that you cant sell on e bay or pass onto a charity shop its a massive read apparently the longest english language book ever written if you want to take it on holidays buy the three separate books or you could easily brain yourself if you dozed off on your sun lounger its basically a love story should lata marry a suitable boy chosen by her parents or someone shes fallen for its set against the backdrop of indian independence the characters are colourful and totally believable id like to read it again but if i pick it up i know ill do nothing else until ive finished it
5004730 i liked the way the author told a story from an autistic childs viewpoint and how others interact with him i had a student with mild autism in my class this year the book really raised my awareness of autism in general and helped me to think about how to phrase questions and listen specifically when talking to this student
5004731 a tough choice but i decided on this one as it is the most recent book i have read and i really enjoyed it a real page turner this book was responsible for far too many late nights and groggy mornings the characters are well developed and completely believable and all evoke a sense of empathy from the reader even in their darkest moments the themes of bravery strength and courage are fully explored both in terms of the horrors of war and in the personal lives of each character involved i would highly recommend this book it will not disappoint

5004754 i knew my father had apnea my father died of a stroke at age 62 but i look at that and i wonder now if i had treated my apnea back at age 20 25 when the snoring and stopping of breathing started would it have impacted the coronary progress i dont know
5004755 my father had apnea and he snored like he sawed wood as everybody said nobody knew about apnea no one talked about it

5004757 wir m ssen ein konzept finden das sowohl mlp als auch swiss life mehrwert bringt ob wir daf r die mehrheit brauchen oder ob das auch ber eine minderheitsbeteiligung in absprache mit herrn lautenschl ger manfred lautenschl ger ist mlp aufsichtsratschef und gro aktion r m glich ist wird sich zeigen
5004758 eine solche transaktion w re f r alle beteiligten wertvernichtend
5004759 schon heute hat das ansehen des konzerns bei den beratern stark gelitten denn die sehen die bisherigen ereignisse eindeutig als unfreundlichen akt
5004760 ich bin wohl etwas zu forsch vorgegangen mlp und awd waren wie zwei geschwister von denen keines den anderen als erziehungsberechtigten akzeptieren wollte
5004761 jetzt haben wir eine traummutter die daf r sorgt dass die geschwister sinnvolle dinge zusammen machen k nnen aber trotzdem eigenst ndig bleiben
5004762 richtig ist aber nat rlich dass wir eine gr ere aktienposition aufgebaut haben ohne das mlp davon wusste
5004763 i said i was going to kiss the medal if i got that gold everyone bites it
5004764 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5004765 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5004766 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5004767 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5004768 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5004769 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5004770 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5004771 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5004772 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5004773 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5004774 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5004775 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5004776 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5004777 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5004778 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5004779 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5004780 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5004781 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5004782 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5004783 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5004784 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5004785 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5004786 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5004787 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5004788 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5004789 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5004790 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5004791 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5004792 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5004793 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5004794 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5004795 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5004796 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5004797 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5004798 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5004799 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5004800 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5004801 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5004802 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5004803 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5004804 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5004805 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5004806 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5004807 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5004808 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5004809 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5004810 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5004811 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5004812 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5004813 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5004814 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5004815 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5004816 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5004817 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5004818 the rogue executive defense is a well trodden excuse that should fool no one
5004819 if drug cartels can ship up to 10 tons of cocaine in a semi submersible they can clearly ship or rent space to a terrorist organization for a weapon of mass destruction or a high profile terrorist
5004820 were not going to win by pretending problems with barack obama dont exist he has a huge problem connecting with ordinary americans who think he doesnt understand me he is not modest he is arrogant he radiates elitism
5004821 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5004822 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5004823 its not something that i would have recommended but theyre trying to bend over backwards as far as they can to accommodate her
5004824 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
5004825 the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
5004826 congressman ron paul is the leading advocate for freedom in our nations capital
5004827 honestly this dont make other kids want to come here or do this olympic thing at all
5004828 to come here and get treated like that by judges whats the point in coming
5004829 the fights ive seen raushee warren got robbed raynell williams got robbed i was throwing a lot of punches but the judges werent giving me my points its a shame how it happened like that
5004830 this makes it a little bit sweeter just knowing ive been through some pretty big injuries and had some doubters
5004831 it just made me so much stronger and it made me the person i am today
5004832 its definitely been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
5004833 she grew up real quick we had to adjust everything
5004834 it happens with all girls today they are small tomorrow
5004835 if she grows very fast shes probably not so strong physically shell have problems with her health he found the solution
5004836 even on floor we managed to find some interesting stuff
5004837 this year has been one of the hardest years of my life as well as one of the greatest years of my life
5004838 ill probably take a deep breath and it will all hit me im still on an emotional high
5004839 i said i was going to kiss the medal if i got that gold everyone bites it
5004840 i was going to make out with mine i guess ill have to wait another four years to do that
5004841 i feel i could have done more that i didnt lay it all out there
5004842 im very upset i didnt attack more i shouldve fought harder
5004843 its the olympic games were not coming in here and expecting a medal to land in our lap
5004844 on one hand its a pity no gold on the other hand thank god i got the bronze i appreciate this medal
5004845 she was quite strong so i should accept the result
5004846 there is a ceasefire and russia is currently not in compliance with this ceasefire
5004847 have just this morning sunday announced that their troops will begin to withdraw and withdraw fully and completely back to the lines prior to this conflict tomorrow on monday
5004848 this is the promise that the russian president has given to the french president i hope this time hell keep his word
5004849 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5004850 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
5004851 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
5004852 theyre taking care of him and were very grateful for it

5004855 it is time that we squarely face the fact that institutional schoolteaching is destructive to children nobody survives the seven lesson curriculum completely unscathed not even the instructors the method is deeply and profoundly anti educational no tinkering will fix it in one of the great ironies of human affairs the massive rethinking the schools require would cost so much less than we are spending now that powerful interests cannot afford to let it happen you must understand that first and foremost the business i am in is a jobs project and an agency for letting contracts we cannot afford to save money by reducing the scope of our operation or by diversifying the product we offer even to help children grow up right that is the iron law of institutional schooling it is a business subject neither to normal accounting procedures nor to the rational scalpel of competition
5004856 for me the goal right now should be and this is where we can find common ground
5004857 on an issue like partial birth abortion i strongly believe that the state can properly restrict late term abortions i have said so repeatedly all ive said is we should have a provision to protect the health of the mother and many of the bills that came before me didnt have that part of the reason they didnt have it was purposeful because those who are opposed to abortion have a moral calling to try to oppose what they think is immoral oftentimes what they were trying to do was to polarize the debate and make it more difficult for people so that they could try to bring an end to abortions overall as president my goal is to bring people together to listen to them and i dont think thats any republican out there who ive worked with who would say that i dont listen to them i dont respect their ideas i dont understand their perspective and my goal is to get us out of this polarizing debate where were always trying to score cheap political points and actually get things done
5004858 and if we can acknowledge that much then we can certainly agree on the fact that we should be doing everything we can to avoid unwanted pregnancies that might even lead somebody to consider having an abortion
5004859 weve actually made progress over the last several years in reducing teen pregnancies for example and what i have consistently talked about is to take a comprehensive approach where we focus on abstinence where we are teaching the sacredness of sexuality to our children but we also recognize the importance of good medical care for women that were also recognizing the importance of age appropriate education to reduce risks i do believe that contraception has to be part of that education process and if we do those things then i think that we can reduce abortions and i think we should make sure that adoption is an option for people out there if we put all of those things in place then i think we will take some of the edge off the debate were not going to completely resolve it at some point there may just be an irreconcilable difference and those who are opposed to abortion i think should continue to be able to lawfully object and try to change the laws
5004860 mr obama i know youre a christian with a family of your own so how can you support murdering babies
5004861 i told him i understood his position but had to disagree with it i explained my belief that few women made the decision to terminate a pregnancy casually that any pregnant woman felt the full force of the moral issues involved when making that decision that i feared a ban on abortion would force women to seek unsafe abortions as they had once done in this country i suggested that perhaps we could agree on ways to reduce the number of women who felt the need to have abortions in the first place
5004862 neither my mind nor my heart changed that day nor did they in the days to come but that night before i went to bed i said a prayer of my own that i might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that had been extended to me
5004863 do they want their kids to come to their parents
5004864 should you force them to do so even in circumstances where there could be trouble that comes from that

5004880 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5004881 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5004882 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5004883 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

5004891 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5004892 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5004893 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year

5004951 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5004952 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5004953 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5004954 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5004964 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5004965 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5004966 the wisconsin library commission has been repeatedly asked to advise the public libraries of the state as to the policies to be pursued in handling the literature which bears directly or indirectly upon the war inasmuch as the law makes it the commissions function to give advice to wisconsin public libraries we are responding to these requests and are sending to all public libraries of the state as the suggestion of the commission for their guidance a letter containing the following it has been the policy of public libraries so far as the ordinary controverted issues are concerned to assume a neutral position since the library as the property of and the representative of individuals on both sides of each controverted question could not itself become partisan this naturally led the library to provide material presenting the claims of the partisans upon each side of the controversy prior to the declaration of war the issues between the central powers and america might have been discussed with propriety when war was declared the question was decided against the central powers by the decision of our representative government at washington and the discussion was closed in this decision every loyal citizen was bound to acquiesce the library supported by public funds is a part of the government which is at war with germany and austria and has necessarily taken sides it is in fact itself in this war against germany to be neutral now is to be disloyal it is most important there fore it seems to us that the library authorities do not permit themselves to be misled by the argument that it is a duty to present both sides of all controverted questions and that therefore anti american books are permissible to do this will inevitably invite well merited criticism and the accusation that it its operating as an agency for the distribution of anti american propaganda the biggest job which the entire american people has before it is to win this war every loyal citizen must consider himself enlisted the duty of actually assisting in every way possible to win the war is as definitely upon the library as it is upon the man in the trenches if a soldier should stop fighting for the purpose of entering into an academic discussion with a boche over the merits of the controversy he would be shot as a traitor the librarian and the library trustee are just as much enlisted in the fight as is the soldier like the soldier they cannot take a neutral position we therefore advise 1 that all books as to the patriotic character of which there is any doubt be immediately withdrawn from the shelves 2 that no book pamphlet or magazine the patriotic tendency of which is in any doubt be added to the library 3 that every effort and al available funds be expended in securing and distributing material tending to awaken patriotism in the patrons of the library the library must remain above suspicion

5004968 clinton the only top tier candidate on the ballot thus causing those who did not support her to not go to vote
5004969 between the two of us it is our belief and to the best of our knowledge that no prisoner was beaten or harmed physically in that camp the plantation my only contention with the mccain deal is that while he was at the plantation to the best of my knowledge and teds he was not physically abused in any way no one was in that camp it was the camp that people were released from
5004970 no man witnessed another man during interrogations we relied on each other to tell the truth when a man was returned to his cell
5004971 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5004972 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5004973 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5004974 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
5004975 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
5004976 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point
5004977 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5004978 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5004979 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5004980 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5004981 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5004982 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5004983 im more at a loss for words than i was saturday
5004984 it just shows how much teamwork and how much togetherness we have its amazing to be part of it was a great experience for me and something ill have forever
5004985 were going to give the americans a good shake and hopefully keep phelpsy from getting his eighth gold

5004993 all of a sudden swimming is getting all the hype there are other big events in the sport but no one ever watches in the olympics its the most exciting thing
5004994 ive been getting phone calls e mails and texts from friends who have nothing to do with swimming
5004995 for me hes been around so long that im used to him winning but as you watch these races and hes breaking these records by such huge margins its impossible for everyone not to notice we swimmers see him as opening the door
5004996 he is phenomenal a guy like that comes around only once in a lifetime
5004997 im hoping all these little kids are going to be getting into the pool
5004998 all of a sudden swimming is getting all the hype there are other big events in the sport but no one ever watches in the olympics its the most exciting thing

5005000 for me hes been around so long that im used to him winning but as you watch these races and hes breaking these records by such huge margins its impossible for everyone not to notice we swimmers see him as opening the door
5005001 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5005002 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5005003 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5005004 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5005005 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5005006 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5005007 were doing a conversation piece called facetime uhh we gonna ask you some questions and you can ask us some questions were so glad we stuck through it all
5005008 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5005009 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

5005031 it looks like a j wont be here next season if you just put the numbers together you can figure it out real easy burnett is having a good year and you have to think that if wed had more offence hed have even more wins
5005032 hes just answering questions honestly just like everybody else does but im not going to look into it hes just answering a question he was probably putting himself in my shoes and answering anything that he would do but im not going to worry about it ive got a month and a half to finish and ive got more important things like trying to get to the post season with this team than worrying about that
5005033 if it does well deal with it hes pitching well for us and thats all thats important for us right now
5005034 were prepared either way if he wants to stay hes more than welcome to stay if he doesnt stay we think we have enough guys internally that we can plug the gap
5005035 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5005036 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5005037 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5005038 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5005039 we want to open up a facility that the communities up there want to see reopened we know how to run the business i see it as a no brainer
5005040 we dont simply want a hospital we need a hospital

5005042 disrupt and damage the operations of surrounding hospitals which are already challenged by drastic cutbacks in new jerseys charity care funding and the intensely competitive marketplace
5005043 a good opportunity to work with a quality partner like hackensack we think bergen county is a good area to operate a hospital
5005044 except for pascack which appears to have been under managed everybody around is doing well if not very well
5005045 the same way we treat patients here theyll be treated up there
5005046 i would not want one car dealership in town the more competition you have for quality care you get better prices and better service
5005047 we want to open up a facility that the communities up there want to see reopened we know how to run the business i see it as a no brainer
5005048 we dont simply want a hospital we need a hospital

5005051 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5005052 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5005053 it is the soldier not the reporter who gave us freedom of speech
5005054 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5005055 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5005056 225 000 ethnic albanian men aged between 14 and 59 may have been murdered
5005057 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5005058 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5005059 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5005096 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5005097 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5005098 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5005099 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
5005100 each of these fenced in areas is about five yards by five yards
5005101 if 300 people are taken to denvers temporary detention facility within a short time frame processing those persons at the rate of 30 to 50 per hour would take at least 6 to 10 hours
5005102 during the republican national convention in new york city in 2004 nearly 1 100 people were arrested in a four hour period if a similar situation occurred in denver it would take at least 22 to 36 hours to process those persons
5005103 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
5005104 at the temporary facility denver will of course also be required to provide for detainees basic human needs such as adequate food and drinking water access to toilets and facilities for washing and access to medical care if necessary
5005105 detainees must also be allowed the opportunity for bodily movement including release from handcuffs or flexicuffs
5005106 denver must establish a system to ensure that detainees are assured of access to medically necessary prescription medications they may be taking some arrestees will need prescription medications that are in the possession of family members who were not arrested denver will have to arrange a system to receive the medications from family members and then deliver them to the appropriate prisoner failure to deliver appropriate and necessary medications could result in serious deterioration and damage to a detainees health
5005107 this facility will not be used for long term detention
5005108 arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing water bathrooms medical staff and phones will be available to them the facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation
5005109 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

5005132 trigger foods are any foods that trigger you to overeat and or binge they are foods that you just cant get enough of one bite is never enough and one helping isnt enough trigger foods can also lead you to overeat on other foods that initially you werent even thinking about eating if you feel guilty for eating your trigger foods in the first place some people could have just one trigger food category like ice cream and others could be triggered by anything sweet salty or fatty usually trigger foods contain refined sugar and while trigger foods dont necessarily lead to a binge its interesting to note that the binge eating survey i did here at the fit shack showed that 72 of the survey participants binged on foods that contained sugar

5005140 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs

5005146 it targets kids 16 to 25 years old these classes are put on by law enforcement officers who have been trained it talks to these kids about what to do to stay safe it lets the kids get involved in open discussions
5005147 there are even schools in the state down in lexington county where the only way you can drive a vehicle to school is to go through the course we dont have that yet but our local schools are working on that id be supportive of it
5005148 the other sheriffs in the state many of them want the program but they cant get it because the federal government has not properly funded it were asking congress to get on board the community and the public should cry out to their representatives and encourage them to find funding its at least a way that we can do something about illegal aliens being here in this country
5005149 in the next couple of months working through national accreditation were getting ready to be tested thats going to be quite an honor in 30 days well have the answer
5005150 i started in the city of york as a fireman and dispatcher the day i turned 21 was the first day i was officially a police officer on the beat the only air conditioning i had was rolling down the windows we had nightsticks and black jacks we had five and six shot revolvers

5005154 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5005155 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5005156 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5005157 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5005158 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5005159 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5005160 who are open to doing something on the production side
5005161 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5005162 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

5005196 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5005197 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5005198 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5005199 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5005200 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5005201 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5005202 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5005203 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5005204 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5005205 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

5005215 in finnland waren wir vor zwei wochen noch die au enseiter standen am ende aber doch als sieger da
5005216 hier galten wir dagegen als favoriten und das hat uns gewaltig unter druck gesetzt ich darf mit stolz sagen dass jeder bei citroen sport sich dieser aufgabe gestellt und seinen beitrag dazu geleistet hat den ersten doppelsieg des jahres einzufahren noch dazu wo die meisterschaft in ihre entscheidende phase eintritt
5005217 das ist ein ermutigendes ergebnis f r die noch vor uns liegenden fights s bastien und daniel haben einen einwandfreien lauf gezeigt und auch dani und marc waren klasse in form sie haben uns mit dem zweiten platz weitere wichtige punkte beschert unsere autos und crews haben eine beeindruckende historie bei der rallye deutschland und eine weitere herausragende leistung hat uns nun an die spitze der herstellerwertung katapultiert
5005218 s bastien ist au erdem in der fahrerwertung nach vorne ger ckt
5005219 f r uns war das also ein ganz ausgezeichnetes wochenende in jeglicher hinsicht wir k nnen es uns allerdings nicht leisten uns zur ckzulehnen und zu relaxen morgen werden wir schon wieder reichlich besch ftigt sein denn es liegen noch stressige monate vor uns
5005220 nachdem wir unseren hauptrivalen vor seiner haust re geschlagen haben wollten wir auf keinen fall jemand anders den sieg in deutschland einfahren lassen
5005221 unser c4 hat sich vom start bis ins ziel hervorragend geb rdet und wir haben jedes mal die richtige reifenwahl getroffen ich hatte ein prima gef hl im auto egal auf welchem untergrund wir uns auch bewegten
5005222 das bedeutete dass wir ab dem startzeichen vollgas geben und dann unsere position festigen konnten es ist fantastisch hier in trier schon wieder gewonnen zu haben denn hier kommen immer unglaublich viele zuschauer das ergebnis ist auch in punkto fahrerweltmeisterschaft sehr positiv denn wir haben die f hrung zur ckerobert wir haben also jeden grund mit diesem wochenende sehr zufrieden zu sein
5005223 ich bin sehr zufrieden damit den zweiten platz erreicht zu haben die deutschland rallye ist nicht unbedingt meine lieblings asphaltveranstaltung das layout l sst einfach keinen richtigen rhythmus zu es war aber schon nett wieder einmal auf best ndigen oberfl chen zu fahren wir waren uns anfangs nicht wirklich sicher mit dem setup aber das technik team hat uns f r den samstag ein perfektes auto hingestellt
5005224 davon ausgehend konnten wir unsere pace steigern und ich hatte jede menge spa beim fahren unser ergebnis bringt citroen einen doppelsieg und unsere gesamtpunktzahl man vriert uns an die spitze der meisterschaft wenn das kein tolles ergebnis ist
5005225 in der fahrerwertung habe ich auch einen platz gewonnen jetzt gilt es diese leistung erneut zu bringen

5005342 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5005343 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5005344 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5005346 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5005347 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve

5005365 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5005366 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5005367 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5005368 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5005369 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5005370 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5005371 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5005372 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5005373 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5005374 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5005375 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5005376 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5005377 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5005378 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5005379 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5005380 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5005381 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5005382 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5005383 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5005384 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5005445 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5005446 i did the best i could despite the result i tried my hardest
5005447 i first started wrestling when i was roughly 11 years old mr bob anderson my 6th grade p e teacher decided to go over some basics with us i guess he saw some potential in me because i was so enthusiastic and energetic about the sport
5005448 from there he introduced me to neal kranz the head coach of the guam national wrestling team it was pretty amusing because he thought i was way too young so for about two weeks i sat around and watched the men practice and finally neal gave in and taught me some moves perseverance pays off
5005449 this journey although it is nowhere near over has been a very exciting one there have been a lot of smiles and a lot of tears theres sweat blood doubt fear and theres joy triumph and victory and i have learned that once you are victorious all the pain you experienced seems to fade into the distant background
5005450 i have learned that in order to accomplish anything you have to believe that you can i never compare myself to others because this is my journey at the end of the day im the only person i have to face
5005451 going to the olympics has been my only dream since i was 11 now 11 years later here i am on my way sure it took some time but speed was not my goal
5005452 the only difference now is that i dream to win the gold medal for guam i envision myself on the medal stand with the guam anthem blaring in the background the mind is so very powerful when it is set on pleasing ones heart
5005453 she is quite the sneaky lady when we are face to face she tells me she wants me to quit wrestling and become a model yet when i am gone she tells everyone how proud she is
5005454 my coaches too neal kranz alex gutierrez and mike duroe who take so much of their time teaching me how to be a better wrestler and never really knowing that they are actually making me a better person my team friends and family all of you burn in my heart when i am away your support is monumental in my progression

5005486 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5005487 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5005488 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5005489 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5005490 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5005491 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5005492 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority

5005500 but as has been the case with this bear he simply made another wrong turn
5005501 worst case scenario you have the bear struck on an eight lane highway injured and in close proximity to humans
5005502 thats just a situation likely to end with a bad outcome
5005503 that bears been through a real ordeal the last few weeks wed hate for people to get out and look to bother it

5005825 if you want to commit suicide it is up to you but you do not have the right to kill your country it is so sad the athens games golden girl was caught doping i don t believe they put something in her drink or vitamins they always have the same excuse
5005826 the only reason she could do this is shes never been out of shape a day in her life she loves to train and be fit
5005827 i did this in sydney but i was 33 then
5005828 shes a model for me i must learn from her
5005829 if it helps anyone else out there who is in their middle aged years and they put off something they thought they couldnt do because they were too old or maybe thought that because they have children they cant balance what they want to do and be a parent then im absolutely thrilled

5005842 its a beautiful project and its all ready to go technically
5005843 all the planning is done i worked with engineers i worked with the maritime services board i worked with the bridge people the opera house
5005844 everybody was ready to say yes but i never managed to get the finance together
5005845 forty five years of knowledge and of good practice prove that it will be a magnificent event
5005846 it would be a great way to show to the world the beauty of sydney
5005847 i never do a walk without as an engineer designing the anchor point as a master rigger spending days or weeks or months directing my crew and making sure every little detail is correct
5005848 this arrangement is simply morris iemma and the labor party head office using taxpayers funds to prop up their election campaigns
5005849 taxpayers pay for a salary increase to almost all labor mps and then a large chunk of that extra salary goes directly to the labor party its no wonder labor mps dont object to having their salary levied by head office when they get paid additional salary that covers the levy
5005850 another suspect salary increase is that paid to john aquilina the leader of the house
5005851 a minister with other portfolios usually holds this position so no additional salary is normally paid but last year the premier approved a special salary increase of over 68 000 for mr aquilina
5005852 weve got all sorts of dubious positions being created just to top up the salaries of members of the most underperforming state government in the history of australia
5005853 rather than rorting the system they should be figuring out how they can manage the economy provide infrastructure and improve services that have been paralysed through labor mismanagement
5005854 the opposition likes to complain about a lack of resources but when they failed to manage their office budget last year they received supplementation to cover the massive blow out in costs
5005855 the offices of the leaders of the opposition have consistently over expended their combined budget and 2006 07 was no exception the opposition budget was blown by more than 40 per cent
5005856 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
5005857 far exceeds what they could earn at home representing a boost for them their families and their local communities
5005858 weve had illegal foreign labour in australias agricultural sector for decades and theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour thats why i support a system that regulates it
5005859 release valve on pressure for employment for the rapidly growing youth population in the pacific islands
5005860 demand is doubling every year and still we are only seeing those who are at the extreme end because we dont have the resources to see the others
5005861 obviously wed rather prevent obesity than treat it so we never have to see these people in a hospital but this is a start
5005862 there is a major lack of understanding in the community about obesity and its effects
5005863 it hasnt been taken seriously as a medical issue and very limited resources have been put into it there have been a lot of plans at a government level but little action this new position will help us tackle it but i still believe we are only hitting the tip of the iceberg
5005864 it is amazing that it has got to this stage
5005865 i wish we could get funding to do the same thing because we are seeing a real increase in the number of overweight children and obesity has a huge impact on cancer diabetes and heart disease
5005866 all the improvements that have been made in combating these diseases is being wiped out by obesity
5005867 issues of social acceptance athletic competence and physical appearance are well known to obese children and affect their sense of social and psychological wellbeing
5005868 obese children with decreasing self esteem are more likely to smoke and drink alcohol compared with those whose self esteem increases or remains the same
5005869 i said back in february that a lot of these sorts of issues should be dealt with within six or seven months and my decision hasnt change on that

5005874 and included in that is control of the energy transportation routes in that area
5005875 the lesson here for washington is that any modern conflict will include a cyberwarfare component simply because its too inexpensive to be passed up

5005944 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5005945 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5005946 the move comes as china hosts the olympics in beijing where false media reports last year claimed bibles would be banned from the games
5005947 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5005948 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5005949 the bibles were printed in chinese he said klein said the customs officers had told him that they could each have one bible for personal use and not more than that
5005950 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5005951 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5005974 es cierto y lo tenemos que decir en este momento llevamos un ejercicio que avanza no con la fluidez que quisi ramos en parte es por la falta de personal y a final de cuentas tendr que salir bien el trabajo

5005979 we finally managed to keep a clean sheet and our defence looked really solid thats very positive and a big step forwards compared to our other friendly matches
5005980 we also created a lot of chances especially in the first half we got a little bit sloppy after the break but that was caused by all the substitutes we made
5005981 there will be no problem about a new contract for gary

5005984 but it is going to be difficult for gary to get into the team when you think about what kind of season wes brown had last year then there is the young lad rafael da silva hes a player

5006246 i dont love you im just passing the time you could love me if i knew how to lie but who could love me i am out of my mind throw an old line out to sea to see if i can catch a dream
5006247 i guess i just prefer to see the dark side of things the glass is always half empty and cracked and i just cut my lip on it and chipped a tooth

5006249 foi um jogo bem disputado e a nossa torcida nos apoiou tivemos boas chances de gols e conquistamos uma vit ria sobre um advers rio dif cil
5006250 nos apresentamos bem mas infelizmente n o conseguimos aproveitar os lances que tivemos agora trabalhar para buscar uma vit ria na pr xima partida

5006252 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5006253 n o podemos nos intimidar e temos de jogar com personalidade como se o jogo fosse no engenh o foi assim que conseguimos bater o atl tico paranaense e o figueirense fora de casa a receita precisa ser repetida

5006255 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5006256 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5006257 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5006258 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5006259 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5006260 this is a planning took where all things are going
5006261 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5006262 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5006263 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5006264 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5006265 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5006266 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5006267 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5006268 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5006269 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5006270 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5006271 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5006272 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5006273 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5006274 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5006275 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5006276 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5006277 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5006278 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5006279 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5006280 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5006281 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5006282 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5006283 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5006284 chelsea batter pompey to show their winning intent parachutist amp burnley crash at turf moor
5006285 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5006286 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5006287 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5006288 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5006289 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5006290 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5006291 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5006292 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5006293 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5006294 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5006295 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5006296 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5006297 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5006298 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5006299 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5006300 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5006301 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5006302 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5006303 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5006304 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5006305 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5006306 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5006307 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5006308 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5006309 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5006310 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5006311 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5006312 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5006313 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5006314 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5006315 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5006316 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5006317 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5006318 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5006319 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5006320 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5006321 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5006322 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5006323 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5006324 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5006325 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5006326 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5006327 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5006328 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5006329 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5006330 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5006331 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5006332 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5006333 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5006334 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5006335 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5006336 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5006337 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5006338 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5006339 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5006340 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5006341 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5006342 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5006343 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5006344 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck

5006346 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5006347 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5006348 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5006349 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5006350 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5006351 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5006352 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5006353 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5006354 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5006355 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5006356 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5006357 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5006358 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5006410 i dont think ukraine will be directly involved in the conflict ukraine can participate only in a humanitarian and diplomatic sense russia has shown again that it wipes its feet on international laws and borders to resolve its problems russia is eager to keep fuel pipe lines under its control and derail ukraines projects aimed at diversifying its supply sources notably the odesa brody project that can be extended to the caucasus
5006411 the weakness of the ukrainian regime will reveal itself to the full it will be accompanies by a divide in the executive

5006442 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the finish line
5006443 no all four rounds he didnt do what we were telling him
5006444 third round i came out firing i was thinking that maybe id be up by two points but they said it was tied up
5006445 in that last round i went in there with my hands up i know i hit him with a straight left he caught me with the hook ill give them that but i think i caught him with two more punches and should have won the fight 8 7
5006446 we wanted him to box but the main thing we wanted him to do was get up early get ahead first we knew he had faster hands and more power so we wanted him to engage and make the guy have to come to him
5006447 instead they started playing the waiting game from the beginning we yelled at him talked to him between rounds but he basically did the opposite of what we asked him to do
5006448 one of the things we know is that these kids have been calling home so often
5006449 what happens is they get instructions all the way from the united states you can tell the difference because once the bell rings they start doing what their other coaches tell them
5006450 they were trying to tell me to just go at him go at him
5006451 im not that type of fighter to go out there and throw punches if i do that im going to get caught with shots i want to go out there and play it smart

5006480 the first part of the report by the department of veterans affairs administrative board of investigation demonstrates vas continued determination to fix the underlying causes of the quality of care problems which existed at the marion va medical center during parts of 2006 and 2007
5006481 it is a major step in our efforts to hold those who allowed those problems to happen accountable va remains saddened by what has happened to some of our patients at marion and is determined to do whats right for our patients and their families
5006482 we are determined not only to correct the problems we ourselves uncovered but to make marion and all va facilities models for excellence in health care throughout the nation
5006483 the report shows that the management team at marion failed to act when questions were raised about the credentialing of dr veizaga mendez and failed again when they ignored desperate pleas for additional staff needed to provide adequate care
5006484 the va needs to implement the recommendations in this report but that is not enough it is past time that a new permanent leadership team is in place in marion and the va must act swiftly to make that happen
5006485 this report confirms that a failure in leadership and a breakdown of safeguards allowed these tragedies to occur at the marion va it appears the va has taken action to relieve several individuals of their responsibilities since this investigation was conducted
5006486 perhaps most troubling is the fact that patient health was secondary to the financial health of the facility
5006487 clearly that was not the case under the previous leadership
5006488 my colleagues and i will continue to work to see that appropriate changes are carried out and carried out quickly
5006489 more than 80 percent of a sample of air force women deployed in iraq and other areas around the world report suffering from persistent fatigue fever hair loss and difficulty concentrating

5006492 the vas secretary named downtown new orleans as the preferred site for the new hospital
5006493 hoping to avoid annual problems with veterans health care budgets that are too late and too small
5006494 a radical change in how congress funds department of veterans affairs medical programs
5006495 congress to treat va funding similar to funding for medicare and medicaid
5006496 as a way for veterans to get the first slice of funding in each budget without having to compete with other programs
5006497 the difficulty we had was the transition between the department of defense and veterans
5006498 manages soldiers treatments well being psychological care and career direction
5006499 he would recommend the center to any other soldier in his position
5006500 the third annual veterans community response symposium brought more than 200 medical professionals rehabilitation specialists community leaders and veterans
5006501 to push the idea of community based care for soldiers returning home from service
5006502 the new topics for the symposium was the growing issue of female veterans care
5006503 may be improving thanks to a national suicide prevention hotline put in place last year by the us department of veterans affairs
5006504 applaud the hotline they say returning veterans have needed an efficient round the clock resource like this for a long time
5006505 plenty of work to be done to make sure that the psychological wounds of war are addressed when veterans come home
5006506 i have spoken to a number of physicians who have used vista and they tell me that it detracts from patient care and time spent with patients and it results in inaccurate records as physicians use cut and paste to enter information
5006507 members of colorados congressional delegation and the us department of veterans affairs are at an impasse over the location for a new veterans hospital at the former fitzsimons army medical center a project thats been on hold for seven years but jacque montgomery a spokeswoman for the university of colorado denver said the university of colorado hospital is continuing talks with the va for use of the second tower despite opposition from veterans groups
5006508 a philadelphia veterans hospital says it may have given insufficient radiation treatment to more than 100 prostate cancer patients the philadelphia va medical center says its reviewing records of 114 cancer patients who may have received the wrong dosages during the past six years hospital spokeswoman fern billet says two patients have since died
5006509 its not clear if the feared error played any role in their deaths
5006510 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
5006511 when the game is over it all goes back in the box
5006512 we need to ask ourselves what we are doing or not doing with our lives now that could lead to deep regret
5006513 when the game is over it all goes back in the box
5006514 you pet me you feed me you shelter me you love me you must be god
5006515 you pet me you feed me you shelter me you love me i must be god
5006516 lord you love me you bless me you gave your life for me
5006517 god did this for me so i can live a life of blessing life is all about me
5006518 the essence of sin is that man seeks his own welfare in everything even in god
5006519 lord bless me and my family lord protect me lord meet my needs lord take care of me
5006520 so that the gentiles which most of his readers were might not go to hell
5006521 so that the gentiles may glorify god for his mercy
5006522 and i will be exalted among the nations i will be exalted in the earth
5006523 now i know there is no god in all the world except in israel
5006524 so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do it all for the glory of god
5006525 though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls yet i will rejoice in the lord i will be joyful in god my saviour
5006526 basically tells us that god is in the business of shattering our dreams
5006527 for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it
5006528 and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life
5006529 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will save it
5006530 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5006531 well its obvious that habakkuk isnt a real deep committed believer like i am because if he was he wouldnt be asking these types of questions
5006532 okay habakkuk heres what i want you to tell the people
5006533 these people that i love theyre becoming increasingly wicked and for your own good basically i am going to punish you but what you need to understand is i am going to take a far worse people those who are much more evil than you and i am going to use them to destroy you
5006534 what no no no no no no that doesnt seem fair to me at all
5006535 god i dont want to tell them this because i dont like this theyre not going to like this i dont see anything good in this
5006536 how long o lord must i call for help but you do not listen
5006537 okay god i dont get it there was the drunk driver on his fourth drunk driving that crashed into a car and killed the innocent four year old what what do you have to say for that god okay theres that girl who keeps hopping from bed to bed to bed to bed and she is pregnant time after again and she aborts the kids over and over and over again and were a godly couple and our only prayer is help us to have a child and we cant get pregnant what what do you have to say for yourself god okay our kids go to the school and some angry fourteen year old came in with a gun and shot up eight of them where are you in that god
5006538 therefore the law is paralyzed and justice never prevails the wicked hem in the righteous so that justice is perverted
5006539 as far as i can see nothing is turning out fair
5006540 youre letting all these things go on in the world that dont seem fair god you must not even care
5006541 god i know you could youre all powerful i believe you could you could do this one little thing that would change everything god i mean if i were in your shoes i would do it i dont know why you wont you dont seem to really care yet youre not doing much when you could
5006542 god if i was in your shoes i would do things totally different
5006543 god i dont understand im not sure i like this
5006544 whats going on here god are you going to rescue me god are you leaving here forever god whats up
5006545 have mercy god i thought i did everything you said and now whats going on here
5006546 okay okay god i believe youre real and okay i believe your son is the son of god and i surrender to you
5006547 what god now now now now i thought we were here at the spiritual high illustration 2 i was trusting you but now based on what i see it is very different than based on what i thought im not sure what i believe right now
5006548 i want to go right back where i was the spiritual high
5006549 no no no no im not going to have negative confession im healed i think im healed
5006550 oh that doesnt matter im not going to go look for a job im just going to believe that gods going to provide a job
5006551 okay god i thought but youre not so forget you
5006552 if this is going to be how its going to be and youre not going to do what i thought you would do then you must not be who i thought you were so forget it god well lets not play anymore
5006553 2consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds 3because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance 4perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything
5006554 habakkuk you want an answer okay here it is look at the nations and watch and be utterly amazed for i am going to do something in your days that you would not believe even if you were told
5006555 when i tell you this what youre going to do is youre going to go stomping feet youre going to be like what god are you sure youre going to be knocked off your feet and youre going to be utterly amazed
5006556 i am raising up the babylonians that ruthless and impetuous people who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their own
5006557 the babylonians are a feared and dreaded people they are a law to themselves and they promote their own honour their horses are swifter than leopards theyre fiercer than wolves at dusk their calvary gallops headlong their horsemen they come from afar they fly in like vultures swooping to devour they all come bent on violence their hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand 10 they deride kings and scoff at rulers they laugh at all fortified cities they build earthen ramps and capture them 11 then they sweep past like the wind and go on guilty men whose own strength is their god
5006558 heres the story habakkuk youre kind of bad theyre much worse and i know all of you hate them but im going to use them to destroy you
5006559 oh lord are not you from everlasting my god my holy one
5006560 you may wipe me out and all my contemporaries but the nation of israel will not die we will come back
5006561 oh lord you have appointed them to execute judgment o rock you have ordained them to punish
5006562 tell your people i am going to have to destroy them because they are wicked and i am going to use these really evil people called the babylonians to destroy you lesser evil people
5006563 i object your honor objection god you know i worship you and you know im going to honor you but im taking you to court because i have evidence to prove that your actions are not just god what youre doing does not seem fair
5006564 wait a minute god i thought you were going to be like this but now youre not doing what you could
5006565 i thought things were going to be different god why arent you doing what i know you could
5006566 i am going to pretend like this isnt happening and if we can just go back to this point then everything is going to be okay
5006567 okay god if youre not going to do what i know you could do then forget you im going to go back to the place i used to be and just assume that if you could and youre not then youre not good and so i dont trust you god im going to forget about it and go back here
5006568 consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything
5006569 i will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts i will look to see what he will say to me and what answer i am to give to this complaint
5006570 for the revelation awaits an appointed time it speaks of the end and will not prove false though it linger wait for it it will certainly come and will not delay
5006571 though it linger wait for it and it will certainly come and will not delay
5006572 im called to preach thats what im here to do this is all i am compelled to preach the gospel to the gentiles this is the one thing im here to do
5006573 you just wait because i am the heavenly father who is just and righteous and they will get due punishment for their sins
5006574 see babylon he is puffed up he thinks its all about him babylon is saying we dont need to follow gods rules weve got it all together weve got it figured out gods stuff doesnt apply to us his desires are not upright
5006575 in my time wait for it and you will see that my punishment is absolutely just they will get what is coming to them wait for it wait for it my word is good
5006576 see he is puffed up his desires are not upright
5006577 the righteous those who are mine they are going to live not by what they see not by whats going on around them but instead the righteous no matter what is happening they will live by faith
5006578 you should forsake god hes not coming through for you
5006579 but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth be silent before him
5006580 even though i dont understand and even though i dont like it and even though i dont really want to believe that this is whats going to happen the lord is still in charge

5006590 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5006591 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5006592 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5006593 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5006594 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
5006595 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
5006596 all he talked about was his family and this city
5006597 the olympics will not become a watershed of chinas economic development as the fundamental factors that have supported chinas economic progress in the past 30 years are not to change markedly
5006598 these driving forces will not change with the finishing of the olympic games
5006599 after 30 years of development china has turned into the fourth biggest economy of the world
5006600 although the olympic economy has contributed much to beijings economic development the citys economy only accounted for 3 6 percent of that of the whole country besides beijings venue and infrastructure investment only accounted for 0 55 percent 1 06 percent of chinas overall fixed assets investment in the past four years
5006601 so the post olympics effect will not affect the basics of chinas economic development
5006602 from cities to the countryside and from infrastructure to manufacturing and service industries all harbor great development potentials
5006603 we believe this will be a valuable addition to our direct services between taiwan east and south china and hamburg
5006604 se non conosci qualcuno gi dentro non ci provare nemmeno
5006605 we ve heard talk about the conditions for suspending operations and there s not one word about georgia s territorial integrity
5006606 it must be included it s a violation of the rules that have been the basis for peace in europe for decades we can t violate those rules
5006607 this is a region where it s obvious what plans set down on paper imposed from far away are actually worth they re worth nothing
5006608 they have destroyed buildings there has been looting by russian troops they were shooting people
5006609 the council of ministers of the eu should adopt a much firmer position i m calling on them to do so
5006610 the georgian nation and other neighbours also have the right to security if our ally wants to continue to play a role as a great world leader this is the place to show it i m calling on president bush and his team to do it
5006611 que o outro saiba quando estou com medo e me tome nos bra os sem fazer perguntas demais
5006612 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
5006613 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
5006614 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
5006615 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
5006616 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says
5006617 im probably the only person in this town that does
5006618 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
5006619 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families
5006620 were getting a great response in rural communities that have been ignored by washington and left behind in the bush economy
5006621 even the top republican in charge of the partys senate campaigns concedes that the gop will lose seats this year the only question is how many
5006622 democrats have solid chances of winning five seats according to strategists in both parties and public polls and realistic shots at picking off another three to five republican senators republicans have only one good opportunity for replacing a democrat in louisiana
5006623 the scent of defeat threatens to become a self fulfilling prophecy republican donors are sitting on their hands giving democrats a nearly 2 to 1 advantage in fundraising that limits the gops ability to defend key seats

5006647 i dont want to say he shut it down but man he celebrated early
5006648 its been explained to me that when youre running and youre relaxed your stride starts to lengthen a little bit more and your legs turn over faster and you can maintain your speed longer
5006649 you could look at it and say if hed tried to run through the line he might have tightened up but since he didnt he kept right on flowing
5006650 no telling what he could do if he ran start to finish
5006651 i did some calculations last night and figured out that if he can run 9 8 on the curve the second hundred is always faster so he can easily run 19 1 easily or 19 3 easy just calculate it off what he did in the 100
5006652 wont lay down hell have more pressure coming off that curve
5006653 walter dix can run the curve shawn crawford can definitely run the curve so it wont be easy well see how good usain is now
5006654 he put his arm around me and said i watched the race and i know you gave it your best
5006655 when he said that it broke me up crying if you lose and you gave it your best it hurts a lot more than if you quit that really hurt so i really started crying

5006667 he kind of had that smooth attitude that i could see him pulling that off and just walking away
5006668 i had no idea he was an assistant when i first jumped on board
5006669 to find out the history he had at the club was incredible there are bits and pieces of him around the club theres a stool behind our counter that we call byrons stool we still use it every day
5006670 its just neat to see that ridgewood was a major part of his career and a stepping stone for him to go on to huge things in golf its neat to be a part of that
5006671 he spoke to nelson in the morning watched him play in the afternoon and offered him the job later on that afternoon that was all it took nelson agreed on the spot
5006672 coming from texas and with the texas accent and all he said he had trouble understanding people
5006673 about how to take care of members properly and just be a good club professional he had so much admiration for george and learned a lot from him
5006674 he looked back at that time as the most important developmentally in his career
5006675 there was the transition from wood shaft to steel shaft and that modern swing hadnt really been developed until byron nelson did it on ridgewoods range
5006676 i told everybody that instead of doing the shootout were going to have all of the flight winners and whoever hits the pole wins
5006677 the ninth guy to go hit a 6 iron with a little draw and bang the place just exploded
5006678 people were throwing beers and running around it was not typical ridgewood but it was exciting
5006679 he worked 16 hours a day seven days a week to provide for his family
5006680 dad dropped out of the eighth grade to help his parents during the depression years
5006681 he even operated a small junk yard in the back of his parents home
5006682 mom always supported dad in all of his volunteer and fraternal endeavors as kids we all looked forward to the odd fellows lodge picnics
5006683 and for six years he was the police chief even today hes known as the chief

5006744 de boodschap over homoseksualiteit die katy naar buiten brengt staat in de bijbel duidelijk beschreven als een zonde
5006745 de bijbel promoot begrip en vergiffenis ook en dat houd ik mezelf maar voor

5006756 mr washington its been said that youve never told a lie yet we have obtained hidden camera footage of you not only chopping down the cherry tree but placing the ax used in said vandalism into the hands of your once childhood friend barthallomew tiddwaller thus blaming him for the crime care to comment

5006760 president hoover with all the economic problems facing our nation and so many u s children going to bed hungry each night how can you justify a white house budget of over twenty thousand dollars on tootsie rolls alone last year
5006761 this trend is important because if sustained over many decades it could cause significant climate change
5006762 my husband is taking me to the french riviera for two weeks on vacation
5006763 well to be perfectly honest with you we dont have much money and we dont have any material possessions however one thing i can tell you about my husband is that thirteen canaries can stand shoulder to shoulder on his erect penis
5006764 girls ive got a confession to make i was just trying to impress you you know that vacation i was telling you about well its not to the french riviera its to my parents house for two weeks
5006765 your honesty has shamed me its not a mercedes he bought me a plymouth
5006766 xabi has had a dead leg so we had to protect him
5006767 at the end of the game plessis was injured too so we had to change we knew xabi was only maybe 80 of his ability so it was to protect him
5006768 xabi is our player and he is playing well if he continues to play well i will be really pleased but it doesnt matter if you have one good player and you need another one you have to keep the balance of the team
5006769 i explained to him why i needed money for signing other players
5006770 he can understand if you have javier mascherano lucas steven gerrard and then plessis you have four other midfielders and maybe you can sell one player
5006771 when i was first talking with xabi about a transfer we needed money after these months it is not a question of money we would have to have a massive offer because alonso is a great player
5006772 but if we sell one or two players we have enough money to bring in one more good player
5006773 dont forget we will need eight british players and the left footer we were talking about can play in three positions too
5006774 i have the support of at least one of the owners
5006775 i sent emails to all of them but he hicks was clear we had the money
5006776 whenever you make an utterance without crediting someone you are in fact quoting everything you ever heard thought and saw
5006777 at the start of the year we lost a few players so we had a quick chat about it and moved on
5006778 we have to do the job each week and not worry about who is in and who is out just be confident in whoever is around you
5006779 weve had probably one of the worst injury tolls in the nrl weve lost four starting players zillman withers carney and centre phil graham and i know a lot of other clubs say theyve had bad runs with injuries but so have we
5006780 we try not to dwell on it and it doesnt matter who we put on the park i think every player who has put on a green jumper this year has played with pride
5006781 we totally rely on our juniors and thats something the club has to be commended for
5006782 were missing a nine a seven a one and our no 4 in phil graham so theres plenty of reasons i guess you could say weve drawn the short straw but we havent looked at it like that
5006783 were just playing with a lot of confidence were getting a lot of value out of our big guys up front our halves have been playing fantastic footy and guys who probably have just been content with making the side or getting in on the bench have really stepped up and want to make a difference
5006784 thats football they try to get under your skin and youve got to try not to lose it

5006788 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5006789 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5006790 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5006791 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it

5006816 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
5006817 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
5006818 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
5006819 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
5006820 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia

5006843 despite having a valid license grigson was a medical fraud although mr woods jury did not know it
5006844 in 1995 three years before he testified in mr woods trial grigson was expelled from the american psychiatric association and the texas society of psychiatric physicians for flagrant ethical violations related to his testimony purporting to predict future dangerousness because he was not cross examined mr woods jury was not aware of this information nor did the state elicit it despite its duty to see that justice is done and to disclose impeachment evidence

5006850 two things struck me right away the first was that outward appearances notwithstanding the campaign prepared a clear strategy and did considerable planning it sweated the large themes clintons late in the game emergence as a blue collar champion had been the idea all along and the small details campaign staffers in portland oregon kept tabs on monica lewinsky who lived there to avoid any surprise encounters the second was the thought wow it was even worse than id imagined the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men surprisingly clinton herself when pressed was her own shrewdest strategist a role that had never been her strong suit in the white house but her advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution major decisions would be put off for weeks until suddenly she would erupt driving her staff to panic and misfire

5006888 children currently enrolled in kindermusik showed higher levels of self control than those never enrolled and those previously enrolled this suggests that in order for children to reap the benefit of increased self control as a result of kindermusik participation it is important to have repeated and recent kindermusik experiences and remain enrolled in the program
5006889 four year old children who had been exposed to kindermusik for longer periods of time are better off in terms of self control namely a childs ability to plan guide and control their own behavior than similar children with less kindermusik history

5006901 losing gives us an invaluable window into the development of our character losing well is an art that requires all the grace i can muster it means having the humility to face reality full in the face with no excuses but the confidence not to allow losing to define my identity it means no excuses no blaming no self pity but no self condemnation either it means learning to say congratulations it means learning to let go of an outcome i cannot change but to hold on to the will to live fully and well

5006910 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5006912 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government

5006923 if you look at the history of roger penske and roger didnt have the ultimate stats that tony stewart does but roger was a racer
5006924 it is extremely important to me to have somebody that understands the driving part of it the ownership part of it the teammate part of it the personnel part of it which is extremely important nowadays that meant a lot
5006925 so yeah roger i still have a lot of respect for him and look forward to the rest of the season fulfilling my obligations but i definitely see the true racer and the potential future businessman in tony stewart
5006926 were working to not get just one crew chief were working to get a pair of crew chiefs that like ryan said are going to work well together
5006927 it helps us work together better as drivers and keeps the organization just that much more intact ive seen multi car organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
5006928 were going to rely on ryans input as much as anybodys you know to make this decision
5006929 i dont think theres a lot of teams and organizations that have had a scenario where they get to go out at the same time and go after two crew chiefs so you know maybe this is something that will even be that much better for us
5006930 to have tony come on board and now ryan its just unbelievable
5006931 were thrilled tonys led the charge the program is growing its exciting to be part of it to have ryan be a part of it what can we say the rocketman is on board
5006932 we were hoping to have them done for today but we didnt get it done in time so hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
5006933 but its just making sure that we put the right partners together when youre working with multiple sponsors its making sure that you have the continuity between the two to make sure it works for both parties it makes it a little harder and the process is a little harder to get the contract it is done
5006934 its not going to help us none because we cant put but two cars on the track at a time
5006935 its going to be an advantage to have two teams but not four but it hurts a four car organization like hendrick that has four cars

5006946 it is a shame they were werent here but huge thanks to them
5006947 every weekend it seems theyre hauling one off for one reason or another
5006948 they may not all have to be euthanized but theyre definitely career ending injuries attributable to a surface thats too hard too unlevel or punching through the base owners have told me never again they wont come back
5006949 i keep my fingers crossed every time i run youve got enough to worry about without having to worry about whether theyre going to break down in a damn race my owners put a lot of money and time into this and its becoming a judgment call do we want to run on this
5006950 we have 250 to 300 owners and trainers working in this backstretch and not one of them has mentioned their concern to our racetrack manager
5006951 and now that theres a big article in the paper and theyre complaining about it its remarkable to us
5006952 the horsemen are not the ones on the track the jockeys are the ones on the track this is their livelihood they put their lives on the line every time they go out on that track if its not safe they will not do it and they tell us the track is in good shape
5006953 i attribute the complaints to people who are losing theyre losing at the track they get frustrated and like to blame it on somebody else
5006954 i took my car out there and ive never been on a smoother road

5006969 however much politicians want to change the attitudes to rape juries are still fairly judgmental where alcohol is concerned its certainly something that helps me as defence counsel
5006970 women drinking is still regarded as not quite right by a lot of juries if they think maybe the woman has contributed in some way by being drunk they will be reluctant to send someone to prison
5006971 you can rape her and ill have your back if she reports you
5006972 my advice to cops is investigate if someone gets their car nicked or their house broken into and their dvd players gone then you start an investigation irrespective of the respectability of the victim
5006973 people are still being dragged kicking and screaming to the plate they say theyre just being realistic but theyre second guessing outcomes around the country you still have individuals who are charged with responsibility at a senior level who are cynical at best about rape in general people are saying is it a priority for me
5006974 i have two preschoolers ages 2 and 4 and this pool is just the right size for them
5006975 it is the worst product id ever bought from toys r us and ill never go to six flags dont buy it
5006976 one person cant slide down the slide while one person is in the pool let alone have 2 people sitting in it the slide is so small and when you turn on the hose to let the sprinklers come down the orange top collapses and has no use
5006977 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
5006978 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
5006979 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
5006980 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
5006981 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
5006982 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
5006983 last night i had a tumble on stage and unfortunately i have sprained my ankle so i am hobbling around on crutches

5006988 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5006989 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5006990 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5006991 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5006992 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5006993 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5006994 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5006995 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5006996 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5006997 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5006998 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5006999 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5007000 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5007001 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5007002 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5007003 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5007004 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5007005 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5007006 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5007007 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5007008 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5007009 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5007010 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5007011 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5007012 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5007013 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5007014 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5007015 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5007016 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
5007017 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
5007018 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5007019 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5007020 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5007021 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

5007027 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5007028 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5007029 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5007030 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5007031 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5007035 john olsen believes that brett painted birds as a refuge from his own violence
5007036 this it of alchemy compacted life passion death and faith in a single empowering word which he characterised as completely linguistically indescribable
5007037 whiteley began the project without any preconceived idea as to where it would lead what it would be like or even whether he could finish it
5007038 an outstanding factor in whiteleys career is that for a period of 15 years 1962 1977 he produced two sometimes three large shows each year

5007049 i respect the elderly geelani but would like to ask him what he geelani was doing when sheikh mohammad abdullah was spearheading a movement in kashmir
5007050 the talks cannot be fruitful if the dialogue between the two sides is held once and resumed after 15 days it should be a sustained dialogue
5007051 the people of jammu are now claiming that they have been discriminated against by successive governments during the past 60 years it can all be sorted out provided we are able to sit and talk
5007052 we have never been opposed to talks with hurriyat or separatists for resolution of the issue
5007053 we appreciate security forces exercising restraint in jammu while dealing with the agitators and we want a display of similar restraint in kashmir
5007054 those who describe kashmir as the crown of india should not have allowed it the economic blockade to happen
5007055 it kashmir is not an issue of gun or money power maybe there is some influence of guns and money but it is in fact a political issue and should be resolved politically

5007066 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5007067 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5007068 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5007069 the canadian people when they express condolences for the death of two canadian women in logar in afghanistan and consider themselves grieved they have to know that the canadian forces under american command handicap tens among the afghan people every day to this kind of condolence and they kill in addition to men numbers of women and children as well

5007096 hmmm 60 grams of fiber but 0 of vitamin c at 95 pesos no id pass this one up not a fair deal
5007097 i hope that with the abolition the party at all levels will have a healthy democratic election system
5007098 the system was introduced to prevent candidates that do not have strong support in the party to contest for top posts just to challenge the leadership
5007099 it is not aimed at deterring democracy even though there is a quota system democracy still flourishes in our party
5007100 laying all blame on prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi for barisans losses is not right because it is clear that dr mahathir is full of anger and uncontrolled vengeance
5007101 maybe he was not aware or maybe he purposely did not want to be aware that his credibility as a former leader is still strong and that his influence on the grassroots both malay and non malays is significant
5007102 his credibility influenced people into believing what he said and he also lent this credibility to bloggers and websites
5007103 the first was when he said he regretted appointing abdullah as the prime minister
5007104 this was then followed up by dr mahathir saying that abdullah was only meant to be a one term prime minister and that more opposition was needed in parliament
5007105 this even caused gerakan adviser tan sri lim keng yaik to ask abdullah to get rid of his advisers
5007106 this is not to say that other factors do not count but dr mahathir cannot absolve himself from this
5007107 there have been many opinions in the aftermath of the election but dr mahathir being a factor was not really mentioned
5007108 i realised that a change in malaysian politics must come from me first i support the opposition
5007109 i want to see every anak bangsa malaysian being treated equally
5007110 i have seen riots on the streets before although now things are different but it is still bumiputra
5007111 quite often mainstream media have to catch up with the online information which is freer and faster
5007112 malaysians believe that there could be changes without bloodshed as in 1969 we have learned lessons from the past
5007113 first of all we have to show that the opposition has the capacity to provide better policies and reduce corruption
5007114 we must make things better and understand the feelings of the people it is the reformasi spirit
5007115 umno is running out of time and a change is needed soon
5007116 the divisional leaders called for new blood in the leadership and that the party needed someone who could bring back the malay support
5007117 most division leaders wanted the leadership to be transparent and to consult the divisions when choosing candidates in the election they did not want parachute candidates
5007118 the management committee only came to meet us when damage had already been done
5007119 it is a serious matter when pkr said it could form the government within six months
5007120 it is better for our leaders to close ranks than go on a witch hunt
5007121 kedah and penang umno leaders want changes at the top
5007122 pak lah is our pm as well as party president
5007123 we are not talking about asking him to resign we are a malay party and we want to do it the malay way there will be no such thing as forcing anyone to resign as what some people have claimed but its important that pak lah draws up his own plans and makes it known to the party our members feel that it will help stop people out there from attacking the leadership and party
5007124 everyone has to share the blame and correct their own faults let pak lah face the umno general assembly in december and in the meantime lets focus on our own work
5007125 he is prepared for the message and he took what i had to say with such calm and dignity that i was the one who felt emotional i would have cried if there had not been other people nearby
5007126 it is not that we love pak lah less but we love umno more
5007127 i can control my division but there are 20 000 branches all over the country and we cannot control them we dont want them making statements and passing resolutions on the leadership that will further damage the party
5007128 a partir de entonces los narcos mexicanos miraron hacia al sur comenzaron a triangular la efedrina a trav s de argentina brasil paraguay y uruguay donde este precursor est controlado pero no prohibido
5007129 recientemente los estados unidos mexicanos han reportado la llegada de elevadas cantidades de efedrina para la elaboraci n de metanfetamina provenientes de la argentina
5007130 cuando la sedronar not lo que pasaba comenz a dificultar administrativamente la comercializaci n de efedrina y se reforzaron los controles aduaneros
5007131 however district and land office records show that 4 325 5ha of forest reserve status had been revoked between 2000 and 2007
5007132 all farmers who move to the facility will be given incentives and business and investment opportunities furthermore the land can also be utilised for other business activities
5007133 n vel b sico primeiro est gio simples para quem est iniciando agora
5007134 we are committed to a reform programme backed by the spirit of the constitution
5007135 i dont see any difficulty we have reached a consensus
5007136 the agenda is clear it makes no difference whoever is the menteri besar they are tied to policies determined by pakatan rakyat
5007137 it was not mentioned in the pas manifesto and has not been mentioned for a long time
5007138 we have learnt and come together on common principles that the people can support
5007139 the challenge is for us to rise to the expectations of the people
5007140 botswana does not accept result of 27 june run off election in zimbabwe as it violated core principles of sadc african union and united nations
5007141 zanu pf and opposition will resume power sharing talks at summit
5007142 you have tsvangirais backers who are playing hardball and insisting on virtual disappearance of mugabe and youve got mugabes backers insisting he remains and maintains some kind of executive powers
5007143 these are the actions of a desperate and cornered regime
5007144 i call on him to resign anyone else would have done so already but he is shameless
5007145 if he waits until the party is totally destroyed it would be useless
5007146 we have reached a crossroads there is something very wrong with our leadership which is abdullah ahmad badawi
5007147 it is pointless if i am alone all of us must be brave if you love your country be brave and speak out
5007148 all scripture is breathed out by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness that the man of god may be competent equipped for every good work
5007149 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
5007150 but my purpose is not to get your vote and not to appeal to mere human testimony
5007151 you have your heads in your bibles constantly because you think youll find eternal life there but you miss the forest for the trees these scriptures are all about me and here i am standing right before you and you arent willing to receive from me the life you say you want
5007152 sunt foarte multumita ca am intrat ultima in concurs am vazut ca gimnastele dinaintea mea au ratat iar acest lucru mi a dat incredere voi continua o mie de ani in gimnastica de fapt cat ma va lasa sanatatea la ultima diagonala am tremurat de a binelea

5007155 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
5007156 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
5007157 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
5007158 they were having so much fun we thought we should join them
5007159 it never grows old i was literally born with a doubles partner she never minds if i miss a shot or two
5007160 i dont know anyone who would get tired of playing with venus williams
5007161 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
5007162 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america
5007163 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
5007164 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
5007165 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
5007166 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
5007167 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
5007168 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
5007169 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
5007170 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
5007171 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
5007172 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
5007173 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day people may be setting themselves up to have more persistent problems by being stressed and anxious when allergy attacks begin
5007174 the fields are white and ready to be harvested but the workers are few
5007175 the effort seems to be leading us towards paralysis through analysis
5007176 ay me manch la remera con caf alguien me ayuda a limpiarme

5007181 we have never set much store on strange and ingenious objects nor do we need any more of your countrys manufactures

5007189 la semaine pass e une dizaine dhommes en uniforme ont fait irruption dans une c r monie de mariage et ont pris les invit s en joue ils voulaient enlever les femmes pour les violer mais dautres militaires sont arriv s et les intrus se sont enfuis en sautant par dessus la cl ture une personne est morte

5007192 the violence is not an accident or a result of faulty planning it is a deliberate strategy it is the direct result of outside extremists teaming up with internal extremists al qaeda with the sunni insurgents and iran with shia militia to foment hatred and thus throttle at birth the possibility of non sectarian democracy
5007193 in our view this definition entails an iraq with a broadly representative government that maintains its territorial integrity is at peace with its neighbors denies terrorism a sanctuary and doesnt brutalize its own people given the current situation in iraq achieving this goal will require much time and will depend primarily on the actions of the iraqi people
5007194 a significant power vacuum greater human suffering regional destabilization and a threat to the global economy
5007195 if we leave and iraq descends into chaos the long range consequences could eventually require the united states to return
5007196 its probably always hard for troops to be far away from home but especially hard on the holidays i use this as an opportunity to try to pay them back for my freedom
5007197 yes saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin bin abdul aziz did visit pakistan on friday and met senior government officials
5007198 the main purpose of the visit was to find an amicable solution to the impeachment issue and that no one should become a laughing stock
5007199 maybe before he might have thought about stepping down but not now
5007200 plans to struggle to be with her dad to videograph the democratic national convention and report on the aapp blog in a planned youth section
5007201 it was a very serious accident but felicia will recover she now has a full brace of her back and chest
5007202 let me just say that my office has received information of the airport trying to avoid the oversight by this committee but this committee and myself will not be detoured from exposing the alleged illegal activities as well as all the other alleged abuses that are happening at the airport
5007203 looting of a bronx charity to finance the start of liberal radio network air america
5007204 but reserves the right to reconsider that alternative depending on future developments and discussions
5007205 met over twenty times to review microsofts proposal and yahoos other strategic alternatives throughout this process our board kept an open mind and an open ear
5007206 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5007207 this is just a redeployment they have pulled out from their bases but they are still all over the place you can see that
5007208 we are here to protect the people and stop looting
5007209 all the roads are free for humanitarian aid and georgians
5007210 the ceasefire is fragile like all ceasefires but it is absolutely necessary for diplomatic and political pressure to continue
5007211 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5007212 it is very disappointing that the zimbabwean people do not yet have the government they deserve
5007213 but i understand why morgan tsvangirai and the mdc movement for democratic change cannot accept an agreement that fails to reflect the democratic will of the zimbabwean people
5007214 ken was a wonderful man beloits no 1 booster and no 1 philanthropist
5007215 this is a terrible tragedy for the family and the community
5007216 we send our sincerest condolences to his family and the larger abc supply family
5007217 du nimmst die grafik legst sie auf deinen server dann verlinkst du die grafik mit einem text der folgendes besagt
5007218 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5007219 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5007220 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5007221 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5007222 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5007223 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5007224 me siento honrado de que el presidente uribe el presidente colom el presidente saca y otros distinguidos invitados me acompa en para discutir la importancia de la competitividad global
5007225 llamo al congreso a aprovechar toda oportunidad que tengan antes de la elecci n presidencial del 4 de noviembre y despu s de la elecci n
5007226 seeing 8 8 08 and the opening ceremonies starting at 8 i guess it was maybe meant to be
5007227 its one of the greatest things sport in general has ever seen
5007228 is that other athletes are not going to realize how hard what he did is
5007229 the world is fast at swimming now the world was not fast when mark spitz did his seven
5007230 its endurance its strength its pressure he made the pressure putt in the u s open he won the tour de france and he knocked out the best fighter in the world in the 16th round with an uppercut
5007231 he did absolutely everything sport is supposed to be and he did it with a smile on his face and hes a good kid
5007232 the only thing that i would have wanted to change
5007233 was the 200 fly i think i can go faster in that event it was a wardrobe malfunction but it was something we took care of and we were able to fix
5007234 other than that i think this was a perfect week
5007235 hes beginning to set a whole new standard for his sport and for america
5007236 the united states olympic committee is very proud of him as is usa swimming and basically every citizen in our country and in many other countries
5007237 hes a true athlete and represents whats best about the olympic movement
5007238 ive said all along i want to be the first michael phelps not the second mark spitz
5007239 this is the first evidence that myostatin regulates muscle mass in people as it does in other animals
5007240 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5007241 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5007242 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5007243 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5007244 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5007245 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5007246 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5007247 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5007248 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5007249 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5007250 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5007251 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5007252 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5007253 se tu fossi dea immortale ti supplicherei se tu fossi angelo ti adorerei se tu fossi donna mortale ti amerei se tu non esistessi non so cosa farei
5007254 una vita senza te come una goccia dacqua nel deserto inutile
5007255 io sono un viaggiatore viaggio nel tempo nelle ere viaggio nel tuo cuore e nel bene ogni sera mi ritiro nel mio pensiero ammirando la vostra bellezza fatta di splendor sincero
5007256 la via vi porta lontano mentre il sol non ancora nato cogliete una rosa per la vostra dama colei il cui cuor piu di tutti vi ama poggiate il vostro manto in un lato e vi inchinate davanti alla vostra dama piano piano
5007257 some people have asked why isn t called the hunted since we came to beijing as two time world champions and were favored to win said mary whipple coxswain of the american team
5007258 but no we were hunting that finish line all the way
5007259 today we just believed and were determined that s what it boiled down to of course we had the usual race day butterflies but once we got started we were just fine it was plan a all the way
5007260 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
5007261 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did
5007262 the day they took the marabout to prison it hurt me so much it was as if they had come to jail me
5007263 its my marabout that did this to me it forged me it allowed me to learn that i can overcome difficulty
5007264 i knew that he would be hit but i didnt think he would be hit up to this point
5007265 ask yourself what is this money used for the kids are not fed so its not for food they wear rags so its not for clothes they dont have mattresses so its not for their beds
5007266 this is a sham on a grand scale under the cover of religion
5007267 the parents of these children believe in these men so completely that when they hand over their sons they relinquish all control
5007268 they swear allegiance to the marabout and say that whatever happens to their son is for the childs good
5007269 my grandson can say whatever he wants but i know the truth
5007270 he was hit because he was lazy and refused to memorize his verses
5007271 nothing profits more than self esteem grounded on what is just and right
5007272 i know of a good half a dozen people who would have loved to do something like this ride but they are no longer with us
5007273 i have seen what this dreadful disease can do and i felt inspired to do what i could to help
5007274 heres the skinny the player falstof requested a petition to which a gm responded falstof repeatedly makes suggestive comments and then requests some cybering a term i will insert for the sake of any younger readers with the gm the gm goes along with the chat and uses some genuinely in appropriate terms but then falstof grows bored with the charade he makes a series of funny comments im really a guy i have aids and quizzically this is sparta end of encounter

5007292 this is a gesture to abu mazen and the palestinian people for the upcoming month of ramadan
5007293 we welcome the release of any palestinian prisoner it is considered a victory for palestinians
5007294 we ask israeli to change its conditions for releasing prisoners and we ask for the release of all prisoners without exception
5007295 yeah if you think its so cool how about i do your ass
5007296 while im mailing you now i want to say that i admire your work a lot
5007297 coming here is like going back home and visiting with loved ones those who take us as we are vulnerabilites faults and all words leave you effortlessly and enter us for what they are honest unpretentious alive and vulnerable the end result is for us like savoring our mothers favorite dish after being sick we feel comforted understood cared for
5007298 it is wonderful to share the ineffable qualities that arise from the experiences of one who has walked from the outer periphery of this beautiful life straight to the center the pulsing heart of existence

5007324 postmodernism is a change or be changed world the word is out reinvent yourself for the 21st century or die some would rather die than change
5007325 the only news i really watch is jon stewart i mean its all the same thing but at least hes entertaining
5007326 10 years of making even people who agree with you cringe

5007328 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
5007329 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5007330 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5007331 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5007332 it cant be described well never ever see it again
5007333 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
5007334 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5007335 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5007336 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race

5007339 me gustar a saber si las investigaciones seguidas hasta la fecha indican la comisi n de conductas penadas por el estatuto de roma y si la extradici n de los l deres paramilitares presenta alg n obst culo en la eficaz investigaci n de los mencionados pol ticos
5007340 hicimos un pron stico de ocho posibles medallas basados en los resultados de todo el ciclo ol mpico dentro de las cuales estaban el softbol y el espadista silvio fern ndez pero todav a quedan las seis restantes
5007341 aqu no ha pasado nada anormal simplemente que hay un excelente nivel t cnico y si nos vamos a las comparaciones regionales vemos que no estamos tan diferentes del resto de los latinoamericanos incluso a estados unidos no le ha ido tan bien
5007342 no vinieron en su punto deportivo ptimo todo parece indicar que lo alcanzaron dos semanas antes de los juegos y aqu estaban ya en su curva de descenso

5007346 i just went in and felt pretty comfortable when youre the backup you have to be ready to come in at any point in the game and
5007347 i think troy and kyle by the basis of practice so far have separated themselves from joe in terms of being ready to line up and win a football game for us at this level not to say it couldnt happen but right now theyve moved ahead
5007348 it was all right it can definitely get better there are some areas on the field where

5007352 faustas blog has a great new look very easy on the eyes
5007353 she writes at length and very well she also posts quite frequently making bad hair blog a treat for the voracious reader
5007354 hey you yeah you you belong at the bad hair blog
5007355 fausta has a great handle on all things european and political go and read her
5007356 as a rule of thumb if fausta isnt happy aint
5007357 i knew i was out there for the right reason
5007358 im not going to say i havent second guessed my decision but when i stepped on the field
5007359 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
5007360 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
5007361 there was collaboration between baghdad police and neighbouring provinces of karbala there were special forces from the ministry of interior who also took part
5007362 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
5007363 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
5007364 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5007365 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5007366 el ambiente de la villa me ha dado una energ a extra con los compa eros siempre cerca y con otros atletas espa oles anim ndote cada d a no ha sido como es habitual en un hotel todos ellos me han servido de una gran ayuda aunque ellos no lo sepan gracias a ellos tengo una medalla
5007367 no me hab a imaginado estar en el podio pero es especial he o do alguna vez el himno espa ol como cuando gan roland garros y alguna otra vez pero nada como aqu en los juegos ol mpicos es especial
5007368 supongo que colocar la medalla en el mismo lugar que el resto de trofeos estoy feliz por ser campe n ol mpico y haberlo logrado es un gran placer

5007375 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5007376 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5007377 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5007378 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5007379 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
5007380 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games
5007381 i would have become the prime minister if i wished to become president

5007405 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
5007406 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
5007407 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks

5007422 the company is only lightly followed by wall street just four analysts cover it so we have the advantage of getting in before the crowds we expect the companys future performance to be about as subtle as a brick through a window

5007428 no we avoided the question of blame if we got bogged down in playing the blame game we would have lost a lot of time we would have never agreed on anything and that wouldnt have solved anything anyhow we are not judges in the european union
5007429 as the european union we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us we need to enhance this partnership so that one day we wont have these situations any more
5007430 theyre very important for society because after an event like that just like the jews with the holocaust or the palestinian problem theres so much emotion involved that you need people that are going to kind of commemorate them the victims

5007442 not until we have three noncommonly polarized great circle bands providing omnitrangulation as in a spherical octahedron do we have the great circles acting structurally to self interstabilize their respective spherical positionings by finitely intertriangulating fixed points less than iso degrees apart
5007443 systems are aggregates of four or more critically contiguous relevant events
5007444 the minimal thinkable set that would subdivide universe and have interconnectedness where it comes back upon itself
5007445 life consists of alternate observing and articulating interspersed with variable recall rates of
5007446 taken as rhythm or dynamism three thus introduces a directional element into the oscillatory rhythm of two whereby spatial and temporal parameters can be formed
5007447 based on the inclusion no longer avoidable of the observer in his wholeness within the framework of his processes of understanding
5007448 the fact that mankinds repeated attempts to establish an orientation toward wholeness possess a quaternary structure appears to correspond to an archetypal psychic structural predisposition in man
5007449 to constitute the fundamental minimum means for subdividing and thus classifying the circle or wholeness
5007450 two pairs of opposites a quaternion are required to set up a bodily unity
5007451 it is perceived as something that exists sensation it is recognized as this and distinguished from that thinking it is evaluated as pleasant or unpleasent feeling and finally intuition tells us where it came from and where it is going
5007452 the summary and brutal coercion of one variant over another but the play of identifications and differentiation agreements and complements limitations and expansions a game which can lead to dialectical synthesis built up in four rhythms
5007453 inter paradigmatic dialogue not only in natural but also in social sciences should be concerned not with the determination of who is right or wrong in defining a concept one way or the other it should rather concern itself with the question of what part of the natural or social realities are best approached by one or the other position two formally contradictory definitions of the natural or social realities may be both relevant and complementary in shedding light on different aspects of the same social realities this is why the logic of inter paradigmatic dialogue cannot be bound by the laws of aristotelian formal logic identity contradiction and excluded middle
5007454 by the very nature of scientific logic which is binary intellecturals tend to form bi polar structures with two opposed camps rallied under two paradigmatic banners the polarization often takes place even within each of the two poles which then divide themselves into two sub poles and so on an inter paradignatic process should be able to break the bi polarity of the intellectual community by introducing a third pole in the dialogical process the role of such a pole is to introduce extra paradigmatic considerations into the discussion and to break the dichotomic argumentation bringing into the discussion innovative ideas
5007455 opposed schools of thought send their best champions for a cholastic exercise leading to nothing else but a reaffirmation of ones paradigmatic superiority over the others
5007456 the tetralemmic model which has been developed in oriental logic stipulates the existence of four lemmas a affirmation b negation c non affirmation and non negation d affirmation and negation 49 p 21
5007457 only an acceptance of the third and fourth lemmas can allow a full representation of the contemporary world problematique in its totality since contemporary world reality is full of cases where a mere affirmation or negation does not make sense
5007458 problem of communication between different structures of reasoning had not been raised until recently
5007459 is itself a victim of a paradigm which assumes that the universe consists of non overlapping categories
5007460 perhaps there cannot be such a methodology a methodology once established would limit the type of paradigms that it can generate
5007461 binocular vision work not because two eyes see different sides of the same object but because the differential between the two images enables the brain to compute the invisible dimension
5007462 is not that a questionable compromise is being carried out but rather that a new human orientation has been demanded or been imposed through power on all humans in fact a single perspective has been imposed or demanded on all humans
5007463 if thought is the ground of man then it follows that thought is radically mans body the limits of his body being again the same limits of the thought that grounds it
5007464 if the plight of man is grounded neither in language nor in the mirror thought but rather in mans decision to reduce himself to a universalized form of thought by grounding himself on it then the emancipation of man will be in radicalizing himself on his decisions rather than on his images but in order to do so man needs other men and the ability to discover them at their origin at the radical level of their decisions and not just their images or ours for this is mans own origin and ultimately his own flesh though this might demand of every man a constant sacrifice of images the ability to liberate himself from the prison of his mirrors and to acknowledge a human reality which though the source of multiple images can neither be reduced nor identified with any of them the other is my own possibilities and in realizing these possibilities i actualize my right to innovation and continuity
5007465 therefore from a linguistic and cultural perspective we have to be aware that we are dealing with a language where tonal and arithmetical relations establish the epistemological invariances
5007466 rg vedic man like his greek counterparts knew himself to be the organizer of the scale and he cherished the multitude of possibilities open to him too much to freeze himself into one dogmatic posture
5007467 it is a blunt arithmetical fact that the higher powers of 3 and 5 which define such subordinate intervals in music never agree with higher powers of 2 which define octave cycles it is mans yearning for this impossible agreement which introduced a hierarchy of values into the number field
5007468 any perspective remains just one out of a group of equally valid perspectives but no song has so universal an appeal that it terminates the invention of new ones the function of any language is to make clear its own dependence on and reference to other linguistic systems
5007469 in a language ruled by the criteria of sound perspectives the change of perspectives and vision stand for what musicologists call
5007470 the intentionality structure of a particular question then determines or prefigures the kind of answer it will receive
5007471 we have cried for and praised many saviours but have lost our own act of creation and the power to revive it
5007472 the narrow logic of appeal to permises and conclusion but rather on an appeal to a community of listeners capable of understanding and changing or re directing the movement of their song
5007473 we find ourselves facing moving webs moving structures each structure a rhythm through which a body world appears revealing a background of living beings together with the glory and terrors of their life
5007474 linear kind of movement which disclosed a perspectival three dimensional space and linear time the audial space time structure opened by sound was articulated not only by rhythm and cyclically recurring movements but movement itself became the base of all contexts structures and the sources of meaning within each and every field of experience
5007475 without the historical mediation of the criteria of sound by which man both imagined and lived his worlds there is no eternal return and therefore no emancipation for mans memory and imagination
5007476 mans emancipation lies precisely in his ability to break the barriers imposed on his memory and imagination by any abstractions which serve to reduce the human body to only the movements of a theory and deprive man from the whole historical movement of which his historical body is the visible path
5007477 straight at the heart of the stillness we never dared to move the human body we come face to face with our most radical problem we have never dared to set into motion our own beliefs about the human body
5007478 it would indeed be a radical failure of the way of these meditations if at the end of the journey the human body remained still unchanged undivided and as silent with its memories and imaginations as when we started this journey
5007479 every man must actively constitute himself by creating a certain order with the things around him structure within a general orientation he already has or has received about the whole of life it is in relation to this activity that the body of man appears as flesh and that the flesh of man makes present for us a context and a structure with which it shares its dimensions for this reason our path or method must focus on the silent and fleshy unity which underlies and is the root of any human reflective thinking
5007480 carries concomittantly an act of creation which can only be effective if that vision coincides with the original viewpoint
5007481 by creating structures of knowledge to see the world in such a manner the doer of this activity becomes the efficient vision and its concomittant creation
5007482 structure of the embodied subject has the double barrel effect of opening a horizon of inquiry and restricting what may appear within that horizon
5007483 not formalizable but the spaces of discourse within which it appears may be formalized
5007484 to discover the language ruled by the criteria of sound
5007485 it is only secondarily that classification of individual entities is made possible and for this we revert to ordinary boolen symbolic manipulation in other words to perceive anything apart from the total field is to perceive it as a subsystem an artificially created aspect of a field of stresses i e pattern in fact according to the law of complementarity what can truly be said in one context language the same cannot be truly said in the other context language
5007486 detached objective aloofness with which we in the west are accustomed to view whatever is presented to our speculative reason this is the precise error of knowledge which the rg veda is trying to correct as a result of the error philosophical activity became in the west not liberating knowledge but an alienation of man from man since he was bent on equating himself with the objects of his knowledge
5007487 in finding the world as we do we forget all we did to find it as such and when we are reminded of it in retracing our steps back to indication we find little more than a mirror to mirror image of ourselves and the world in contrast with what is commonly assumed a description when carefully inspected reveals the properties of the observer we observers distinguish ourselves precisely by distinguishing what we apparently are not the world
5007488 a very suggestive model for positive dialogue between rival philosophies and even more important within human experience itself
5007489 involves a partial ordering of languages in a non boolean logic the non boolean character of which is the mediation for growth and liberation
5007490 re create himself and his society through the appropriate sacrifice eternally exercising thus his right to innovation and continuity this sacrifice is the constant watch man must keep over himself for re directing his own radical interpretive activity
5007491 it would be unphilosophical and inhuman not to open up mans possibilities by grounding him on that movement which will set him free
5007492 the construction of the structures of experience both affirms and denies experience the negation of experience has to be again denied through the activity of experiencing through other constructed experiences i e other frameworks this negation of the negated constructed experience produces the real affirmation of experience in insight or a series of insights which such activity generates these discontinuous insights should eventually produce a continuous eternal or a perspectival viewpoint which would be effective in the sense that no separations could be established between seeing and action vision and action
5007493 nonlinear cybernetics able to handle regulations which are time dependent and dialectic rather than mechanistic
5007494 too much of a good thing can become a bad thing
5007495 bipolarity of human motivations permits switches from positive to negative from attraction to repulsion
5007496 not sufficient to explain the real behaviour of the steersman of a sailing vessel buffeted by changing winds who has to
5007497 change the course abruptly and repeatedly in order to reach his objective
5007498 when we want to analyze and model systems existing in nature and society the dialectic process of successive antagonistic actions requires the model to be quadripolar rather than bipolar
5007499 to say that a system of dialectic interactions is quadripolar is merely another way of saying that the system is nonlinear
5007500 it went really well we had roughly 120 plays plus some other kicking situations and i was pleased nobody at all hurt and everyone made it through the whole thing it is hard for me because at different times the offense and defense had nice plays and big plays
5007501 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5007502 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan
5007503 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you
5007504 but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again

5007539 shes an amazing young woman anyhow with or without a medal
5007540 they are a wonderful family and have come through amazing hardships to get to where they are today
5007541 they worked so hard to make ends meet just to survive and that must have rubbed off on the kids particularly carol
5007542 were just so proud of that family with what theyve accomplished and what theyve done for this community
5007543 i knew we could do well i knew we had the potential and that carol was ready for the gold
5007544 shes put a lot of sweat on those mats and a lot of hard hard work
5007545 it was amazing she was so calm how composed she was

5007553 if i can become the chief minister of indias most populous state four times and this time entirely on my own without anyone elses support then why cant i become the countrys prime minister
5007554 if you pose this question to my casteist political adversaries they will have no answer to this because they cannot see a dalits daughter rising to such heights
5007555 these parties felt most threatened when my name was proposed for prime ministership during the course of the upa governments trust vote in parliament so both the nda and upa decided to gang up and save the central government
5007556 well i should express my gratitude to these very parties as the profile enhancement that the bsp witnessed over a span of just six or seven days was something we would have otherwise taken six or seven years to achieve
5007557 realising that the rise of the bsp was a direct threat to them the congress led upa was looking for new ways and means to run me down and the latest in the series was implicating me in the disproportionate assets case that has been speeded up particularly after i refused to support them during the trust vote
5007558 my supporters are aware that all the wealth and property i have acquired actually consists of the gifts i have received on my birthdays and nearly rs 30 crores rs 300 million out of that has been given away as income tax yet the government is trying to harass me by cooking up false cases
5007559 i am sure my supporters are not going to get affected by such falsehood and campaigns launched by my adversaries
5007560 while the bjp began to hound me by fabricating cases in the name of the taj corridor the congress left no stone unturned in attempting to tarnish my image by letting loose the cbi to concoct cases against me
5007561 the congress leadership wanted to send me to jail so as soon as i learnt about their conspiracy i moved the supreme court and i am confident of getting justice from there

5007574 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5007575 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5007576 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5007577 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5007578 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5007579 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5007580 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5007581 tak boleh guru besar marah sebab lebih besar dari kereta dia
5007582 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5007583 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5007584 the findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials
5007585 while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization
5007586 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5007587 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5007588 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial
5007589 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5007590 i dont think i really understood how to make a record until this one
5007591 the process and the result had much more of a dynamic to it like we werent just presenting songs it felt like the longest childbirth in the history of childbirths but by the end we really got it
5007592 heres a story but hah i did it without following the rules
5007593 obviously they are in a different league to ourselves but i dont think there is anything to fear the country is only 150 miles from us and that means its a big match for us all and its something that should be embraced and enjoyed

5007607 we are likely to face low production due to lack of chemical fertilizer
5007608 with the increasing shortage of fertilizer the price multiplies every single day in the international market countries have scrambled to prevent the food crisis but we could not place order in time
5007609 but the government should manage the supply to farmers at any cost if it wants to avert possible food crisis

5007676 religions are always based on miracles on such things than nobody listens to like trinity yesus called himself the son of god and he was a descendant of david i prefer the religion of muhammad it has less ridiculous things than ours the turks also call us idolaters
5007677 agama agama itu selalu didasarkan pada hal hal yang ajaib seperti halnya trinitas yang sulit dipahami yesus memanggil dirinya sebagai anak tuhan padahal ia keturunan daud saya lebih meyakini agama yang dibawa oleh muhammad islam terhindar jauh dari kelucuan kelucuan ritual seperti yang terdapat didalam agama kita kristen bangsa turki juga menyebut kita sebagai orang orang penyembah berhala dan dewa

5007685 passengers a man is under a train at chancery lane this train is forced to terminate and liverpool street there will be no westbound service between liverpool street and holborn until the situation is fixed
5007686 part of the consideration is what was the best use of that time
5007687 to a large extent the judgment of the meeting organizers was to have the experts in these conditions which are not vaccine safety experts to have most of the agenda
5007688 that this is another case that points to the need of better data on the risks and benefits of vaccinations in children with these rare disorders
5007689 after caring for hundreds of children with mitochondrial disease i cant recall a single one that had a complication from vaccination
5007690 most of these kids get a common cold and either during the cold or soon after the parents notice a drastic deterioration
5007691 to identify who those children are for whom vaccination might cause or worsen a mitochondrial dysfunction so that we can figure out a way to immunize those children safely
5007692 there is no test available right now to screen for mitochondrial disorders that is anywhere near sensitive or specific
5007693 so the whole concept of screening prior to vaccination is a fantasy
5007694 were talking about two things we dont understand very well mitochondrial disorder and autism and putting them together
5007695 were hoping the result of this meeting is at least the realization that more money is needed for research to connect these dots
5007696 a canadian blogger has shown that if googles site was black we could save 750 megawatt hours a year in energy equivalent to 1000 small wind generators

5007699 they seem to have harnessed all their instruments of national power

5007701 kiriman mas awang yang semula membuat saya stres karena saya terlanjur memberi semacam janji untuk menerbitkan sementara belum ada keputusan resmi dari manajemen untuk menerbitkannya apalagi pengalaman di penerbitan masih minim justru akhirnya menjadikan kanzun books resmi disetujui sebagai divisi penerbitan dan

5007708 f llen m glicher bedrohungen seitens russland erfahren die sich gegen georgien richteten und bei denen es darum ging die baku ceyhan pipeline unter russische kontrolle zu bekommen
5007709 russland tendiert dazu die zentralasiatische region von direktem zugang zur weltwirtschaft zu isolieren insbesondere zur energieversorgung wenn die georgische regierung destabilisiert wird bedeutet das weitere einschr nkung f r den zugriff des westens auf baku das kaspischen meer und andere orte
5007710 seit die kontinente vor ungef hr f nfhundert jahren politisch zu interagieren begannen war eurasien ein zentrum der weltmacht der schl ssel zur kontrolle eurasiens so brzezinski liegt in der kontrolle der zentralasiatischen republiken
5007711 es geht darum welche rolle russland im neuen internationalen system alias new world order spielen wird
5007712 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
5007713 die russen die k mpfe in s dossetien absichtlich provoziert und zeitlich genau auf die zeit der olympiade gelegt dies ist ein lange geplanter versuch seitens der russen pr sident saakaschwili zu beseitigen
5007714 und ich m chte betonen dass ich kein kriegstreiber bin ich will genauso wenig einen neuen kalten krieg wie dimitri hier die russen wollen sich ihre historische hegemonie zur ckbeschaffen und dazu geh rt die ukraine und es ist kein zufall da die anderen ehemaligen sowjetrepubliken dabei zuschauen und au erordentlich beunruhigt sind w hrend putin immer weiter versucht sich eine art hegemonialterritorium zu schaffen

5007719 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5007720 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5007721 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5007722 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5007723 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5007724 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5007725 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5007726 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5007727 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5007728 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5007729 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5007730 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5007731 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5007732 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it

5007756 there is no question from now on when people think of the greatest swimmer of all time its only going to be michael phelps name that comes to their lips
5007757 he won eight gold medals he deserves to be remembered as the hero of the beijing olympics
5007758 that will be when you win everything and overwhelm the position that will be a phelpsian achievement
5007759 this is all a dream come true you know to really just imagination anything and works towards it
5007760 to accomplish everything youve really ever dreamed of its fun
5007761 its phenomenal and i think in my opinion well never ever see it again i just dont think that can be emulated or beaten
5007762 what im looking forward to is not doing anything just sitting and not moving
5007763 i expect that theres a lot of kids around the country if not around the world who will next week make a pilgrimage to the local swimming pool and ask if theres a signup sheet for the swim team because theres going be a lot of people who want to be just like michael phelps

5007795 hes been great and it would take a lot of money to prise him off us now luckily there are only two weeks to go to the transfer deadline
5007796 he was just like the player i saw when i went over to egypt hustling and bustling around
5007797 i wondered whether he could reproduce that in the premier league and it looks like he can

5007839 il suo stato un avvio di gara incredibile ma gi alla fine del primo giro ho capito che per lui sarebbe stato difficile fuggire 50 punti sono un bel vantaggio
5007840 sicuramente la vittoria di laguna seca stata molto importante per il morale mio e della squadra continua rossi da tre gare stoner ci faceva paura l abbiamo visto che ce la potevamo fare e abbiamo lavorato duro oggi sono state decisive in particolare le modifiche che abbiamo fatto dopo il warm up di stamattina abbiamo migliorato il bilanciamento di pesi e andavamo pi veloci in curva in pi avevamo le gomme giuste per arrivare fino in fondo
5007841 oggi quando ho visto casey scivolare ho avuto un deja vu mi tornata agli occhi la caduta di biaggi proprio qui nel 2001 quella gara fu fondamentale per la mia vittoria del mondiale non so se questa avr lo stesso significato perch stoner davvero tosto e lotter fino alla fine certo per che 50 punti sono tanti
5007842 wage freeze not this year and probably not next employers say
5007843 on average employers are increasing their salary budgets by 3 9 percent this year according to a survey by worldatwork a nonprofit hr organization it also found that these companies expect to increase salaries by 3 9 percent next year too easing concerns that employers would put a freeze on wages
5007844 said employers are increasing their salary budgets to reward workers for solid performance and to stay competitive these two factors are especially important considering the rising inflation over the past 12 months which is now swallowing up a larger chunk of workers pay increases avalos added
5007845 to counter rising inflation many employers are not only increasing compensation but are also adding flexibility programs such programs like telecommuting allow employees to work from home and save money on transportation costs in the past year there has been a 40 percent increase in the number of companies offering such programs according to worldatwork

5007856 i believe that were it not for the fact that i had been caught out of position by the quick transfer of play i would have awarded dundee united a penalty and would have cautioned the rangers player david weir
5007857 in my opinion there was another defender in close proximity with the possible opportunity to make a defensive challenge on the attacker
5007858 i informed the assistant referee that it appeared to me that the ball was deflected off a rangers player he told me that he had not seen it touch a rangers player but had definitely seen it played by the dundee united player david robertson
5007859 given that david robertson was behind the rangers player my view was such that i could not tell if the ball had been played by mr robertson last before entering the goal consequently i decided to accept the advice of my assistant referee
5007860 it is widely thought that there is a bias shown against provincial clubs when visiting glasgow
5007861 saturdays game is highlighted as a prime example of this
5007862 this is damaging to the game as a whole and dundee united believes that this situation should not be allowed to continue without careful examination and constructive proposals and dialogue between the clubs and the authorities
5007863 for the record the club will be backing the manager on all the important issues raised by him following the match in question and hope that his honestly held views can be used as a catalyst for constructive change
5007864 if its not a level playing field and if we dont get the decisions blatant important decisions then what is the point of turning up
5007865 i thought mike mccurry had the balls to stand up and give these decisions
5007866 not only is it a penalty kick but its a sending off for davie weir but he didnt want to do it because this game meant so much to rangers
5007867 anybody who is of a fair mind watching that today would see that we had no chance of winning that
5007868 we get a perfectly good goal chalked off and a blatant penalty with not even a decision to make and it shouldve been a sending off
5007869 to impinge on a mans integrity in this way is extremely unfair and does nothing to encourage more people to take up refereeing
5007870 to suggest that there was any kind of agenda behind the decisions made on the day does a massive disservice to the game and quite frankly is completely unfair

5007884 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
5007885 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
5007886 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
5007887 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion

5007894 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
5007895 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
5007896 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed

5007923 cuando israel libera a prisioneros solo a grupos que emplean la fuerza contra nosotros transmite el mensaje de que se rinde ante las presiones y de que el uso de la fuerza armada y los secuestros son la nica v a posible para lidiar con nosotros
5007924 e pi bella la medaglia di bronzo che quella dargento vinta in questo modo e con la russia uno degli avversari pi temibili
5007925 avevamo paura ma abbiamo reagito bene pastore ha tirato da gran fenomeno
5007926 e stato bello oggi avremmo potuto vincere loro ma abbiamo avuto un po di sfortuna ci siamo giocati il bronzo in modo eccelso
5007927 ci voleva perch tanto tempo che aspettavamo questo momento con la russia abbiamo dimostrato un grandissimo carattere
5007928 siamo contenti per il bronzo ma oggi era la volta buona per vincere loro peccato per la seminfinale
5007929 e stata una giornata un po nera allinizio per i miei compagni sono stati bravissimi
5007930 i had to pull a couple of pranks so that they figured i was going haywire
5007931 not being amenable to military discipline though a good musician
5007932 was a lawyer and leader of one of societys top bands i stayed with his band until my hair grew too long and he figured it was time for me to get a haircut
5007933 palacios was superb the kid has got everything you want in a footballer and if he keeps playing like this hell be a fantastic one
5007934 it was arsene wenger who recommended him i was trying to sign mathieu flamini for birmingham at the time and couldnt get him but wenger said ive got this lad from honduras on trial and hes worth a look
5007935 he came to birmingham did well and i signed him again for wigan in january
5007936 hes been great and it would take a lot of money to prise him off us now luckily there are only two weeks to go to the transfer deadline
5007937 he was just like the player i saw when i went over to egypt hustling and bustling around
5007938 i wondered whether he could reproduce that in the premier league and it looks like he can
5007939 if he keeps his feet on the ground and adds a little bit of composure to his game then hell do really well for us
5007940 but were frustrated today because of those first 15 minutes when we were dreadful
5007941 obviously it was bad enough to come off yesterday and with injuries like that it usually takes about 48 hours for them to settle or get worse
5007942 hes got a big flight we have to manage it to ensure he gets plenty of ice on it on the way home
5007943 if we keep the swelling down then he shouldnt be out for too long
5007944 i took apart used cooking cleaning appliances and arranged their interior parts very systematically on a white sheet of bristol board

5007965 ihr habt uns eine menge feedback ber unsere sharing features gegeben und wir h ren euch laut und deutlich ihr wollt mehr kontrolle ber eure gemeinsam genutzten daten
5007966 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5007967 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5007968 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
5007969 weve been living in florida now for 10 years so we need to get some stuff together but were not going to rush out of here
5007970 weve got to get back and buckle up our own house
5007971 you still didnt get it right you arent saved still you have a disconnect in your brain somewhere and you will never be saved
5007972 for all have sinned and fall short of gods glory
5007973 that if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
5007974 nearly every school will be ready to open when school starts at the end of august
5007975 this renovation effort would not have been possible without the iraqi army and the dac coming together to get the job done for the children of sadr city
5007976 we are also working on improving our hospitals infrastructure and basic services these are all priorities for our district
5007977 the area south of the wall is improving every day but it is important that we begin work north of the wall to the neighborhoods that have not benefitted from the good works we are conducting because of the threats from special group criminals who care nothing for the people of sadr city
5007978 the work we have done for our neighborhoods on this school is an important step to normalizing the lives of the people we represent who want security and the chance to improve their conditions for themselves and for their children
5007979 mucho m s que el gobierno que a cada rato cambia ministros y funcionarios y hay que empezar a explicar todo de nuevo
5007980 despu s de la tragedia del 99 presentamos al gobierno un proyecto de habilitaci n f sica el consejo nacional de la vivienda lo aprob y nos asignaron recursos para construir 400 y pico de apartamentos luego cambiaron a la presidenta del conavi y todo se paraliz tuvimos que demandar al estado ante los tribunales ganamos la demanda y empezaron a bajar los recursos as hemos construido 200 apartamentos pero el gobierno nos sigue trancando los reales nuestro proyecto incluye un plan de ordenamiento urbano para la quebrada catuche ahora la quebrada esta siendo invadida poniendo en peligro la vida de los invasores las 200 viviendas ya construidas y las esperanzas de las otras 200 familias que aun esperan
5007981 los habitantes de nueva tacagua no somos damnificados sino propietarios estafados pues el estado nos vendi viviendas construidas sobre una falla geol gica
5007982 i say to the mayor and to the citizens of springfield the naacp standing here assembled weve heard your apology we know it took you a long time to get to it we all know the political conspiracy that happened to make you do it but we put all that behind us we dont question your sincerity
5007983 the fire is estimated to be 80 percent contained and isolated to the abandoned housing area
5007984 el ambiente de la villa me ha dado una energ a extra con los compa eros siempre cerca y con otros atletas espa oles anim ndote cada d a no ha sido como es habitual en un hotel todos ellos me han servido de una gran ayuda aunque ellos no los sepan gracias a ellos tengo una medalla
5007985 no me hab a imaginado estar en el podio pero es especial he o do alguna vez o r el himno espa ol como cuando gan roland garros y alguna otra vez pero nada como aqu en los juegos ol mpicos es especial
5007986 supongo que colocar la medalla en el mismo lugar que el resto de trofeos estoy feliz por ser campe n ol mpico y haberlo logrado es un gran placer
5007987 no me dijo nada especial s lo que disfrute de este momento y me felicit porque he jugado muy bien toda la semana
5007988 no hay duda de que ten stica y t cnicamente federer es el mejor para m sigue siendo el mejor el mejor de la historia tiene un talento que le hace manejar una gran variedad de golpes y m s recursos que nadie
5007989 no se han cumplido ni mucho menos todos mis objetivos vine para defender a mi pa s lo mejor posible y m s por la posibilidad de ganar una medalla
5007990 mi nuevo reto intentar jugar bien la semana que viene en el abierto de estados unidos pero tengo la suerte de que all a nueva york va tambi n mi amigo tomeu salva vidal llega a la misma hora que yo y eso ser estupendo

5007993 our plan is not an evil plan and we are not trying to terrorize the people who love the badlands
5007994 we need this and we have a legal right to it
5007995 its going to alter the whole feel of the area if this road goes through
5007996 were very concerned about the soundscape and any potential visual intrusion and dust
5007997 a lot of folks are very supportive of it and would like the benefit of shaving 90 to 100 miles off their commute
5007998 locals are all for it but i wonder how heavy they federal officials will weigh it in a county losing population
5007999 its not like we just threw a dart this is not only the logical location but the only place that is feasible because of terrain
5008000 otherwise wed have to plow through 6 miles of untouched badlands
5008001 we see it as the cradle of conservation where the concept of conservation started in this country
5008002 this is the oldest identification of fingerprints by post mortem remains
5008003 this once again demonstrates our determination to ensure that any rave or unlicensed musical event will not take place in norfolk
5008004 we are using native plants and grasses identified in an 1819 land survey to return the site to the way it was then a haven for birds mammals amphibians reptiles and insects
5008005 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
5008006 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
5008007 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future
5008008 sometimes i look out my office windows and i can almost see the ghosts of the workers and buildings that were here for so many years
5008009 its often hard to believe that weve come this far
5008010 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
5008011 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
5008012 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it i was boxing him using one arm to defend one arm to strike
5008013 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
5008014 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
5008015 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
5008016 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
5008017 the sow found her and beat her up pretty good
5008018 most of the people who are attacked in town dont want the bear killed they recognize she is a mom defending her cubs
5008019 we just cant let her live there because she will attack again
5008020 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
5008021 i think the pecking order needs to be re established with humans on top
5008022 what other city in the world has pernicious wildlife running around in its city parks
5008023 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5008024 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5008025 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
5008026 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
5008027 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
5008028 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
5008029 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor
5008030 the great unknown which is how much the wind company is making
5008031 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
5008032 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
5008033 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
5008034 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
5008035 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
5008036 friends with benefits background checks background checks first interview first date placement that walks off the job one night stands i could go on and on
5008037 because i have to use company time to teach them what they said they knew
5008038 dont tell people how to do something tell them what needs to be done theyll get it and surprise you with results
5008039 its just another source just another way to make money
5008040 when i was working at ameriquest there were fantastic applicants
5008041 of course we couldnt hire them all but then im left with the sophies choice in recruiting what to do with all these incredible resumes
5008042 it all comes down to the fact that we just need to be smarter
5008043 the future exists where people wise up and start taking advantage of these new options
5008044 why would you let an a candidate rot in your database when you could showcase them on rockstarrecruiting com and make good money conversely why would you let a job languish because you dont have the recruiting network to fill it
5008045 because we give you the tools to become more efficient we also expect you to keep working as hard
5008046 you can double your profits and lower your cost to clients if you work this the right way
5008047 anything i can do to ease that burden is time well spent
5008048 its starting to get competitive out there this can help recruiters fill more orders in less time
5008049 this will revolutionize the way people recruit the next generation of hr and management are coming in they are going to want to cut costs to make operations more efficient rsr offers that not everything can stay the same but there is definitely the possibility for things to get better
5008050 members are not permitted to engage in any activity for the purpose of inappropriately gaining attention or diverting members to a listing this includes any activity that harms the shopping experience by making it difficult for buyers to find the items they are looking for ultimately it is the sellers responsibility to ensure that each listing accurately reflects the item being sold while not using any unfair methods to divert members to their listing this includes but is not limited to a listings title subtitle item specifics description pictures links and meta tags
5008051 any other activity that ebay deems as inappropriately diverting members to a listing or harming the finding experience for buyers
5008052 to divert attention to a listing and goes as far as to state that their policy includes
5008053 ebay believes in a level playing field as a result the consequence guidelines are the same for both large and small sellers the number of violations that will lead to ebay taking action against an account is the same for any type of seller
5008054 ebay believes that all sellers should have the same consequences applied independent of sales volume if a driver is stopped by a policeman for speeding the driver receives a ticket whether the driver clocks 5 000 or 40 000 miles per year
5008055 communication to sellers about potential policy violations however may differ by size of seller large sellers may for example receive a phone call as opposed to an e mail
5008056 has nothing on the road map to repair the problem
5008057 this year some kids were able to express things for the first time
5008058 we will be gone at the end of the year
5008059 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
5008060 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
5008061 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
5008062 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
5008063 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough
5008064 we need to be able to be there for people who need us
5008065 o la prise en charge des passagers est bien meilleure que sur les voies
5008066 os ltimos dias do meu av foram muito dif ceis porque minha av que ligava para ele todos os dias parou de ligar e ele percebeu que alguma coisa havia acontecido n s decidimos n o contar para ele sobre o coma
5008067 apesar de passar pelos tratamentos nunca disseram para ele que era c ncer ele dizia que n o queria saber o que era era uma atitude
5008068 uma pequena rua carinhosa ali ele estar junto de n s sempre
5008069 if you wouldnt do it in a social situation dont do it on a social network
5008070 we were walking out of the gardens and there was this gorgeous moon jean looked up and said moon moon shining bright stuck in heaven like a cake
5008071 my ex husband was so pleased and excited that when we got home he made her repeat it he wrote proudly jean lims poem at age three years four months
5008072 i live in this little box in the sky so it is absolutely refreshing to hear the chirping of crickets and other sounds you would never associate with urban life
5008073 it never ceases to amaze me that in the midst of the city you can be in the midst of a jungle doing a little jungle walk it is almost like a luxury to me
5008074 sometimes i sit on the bench and look at the water i feel a little bit too abashed to bring bread to feed the fish but i think one of these days i will do that
5008075 i once saw a couple with their limbs all entangled rolling down a slope luckily they were fully clothed i remember i was so amazed but they couldnt be bothered
5008076 i did not choose to come here actually i got married to a singaporean and he finally decided to leave malaysia
5008077 i am probably less sentimental than most i am a pragmatist and i feel that sometimes these things have to go
5008078 the external surroundings to me are far less important than the inner landscape it doesnt matter if you tear down a building but values must remain and must be preserved for younger people to be aware of
5008079 i love no question about that this is the place where i am very happy
5008080 a lot of the problem you have is people dont really sit and anticipate a bike
5008081 when they look down the road and see a car coming they cant see the bike coming in front of the car
5008082 people have got to think motorcycles every officer on a bike will tell you that almost daily they have someone pull out in front of them
5008083 they believed that this place was the entrance to xibalba that is why we have found the offerings there
5008084 it is very likely this area was protected as a sacred depository for the dead or for the passage of their souls
5008085 these sacred tunnels and caves were natural temples and annexes to temples on the surface
5008086 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
5008087 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
5008088 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
5008089 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
5008090 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
5008091 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
5008092 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
5008093 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
5008094 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off
5008095 good that makes my job a little a bit easier
5008096 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5008097 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5008098 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5008099 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5008100 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5008101 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5008102 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5008103 presumably kovachs staff is hard at work brainstorming and polling what kind of conflict will play best to explain her once again hiding from voters and the media

5008108 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation with a lot of the constitution
5008109 i think that he thomas has been an embarrassment to the supreme court i think that his opinions are poorly written i dont i just dont think that hes done a good job as a supreme court justice
5008110 without a doubt the lowest moment of the night was obamas smear of clarence thomas he like harry reid
5008111 dad do you mind my asking you all of these questions
5008112 of course not you dont ask questions you never learn nothin
5008113 but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
5008114 well at some point people have to get on the same page and realize that a company is in business to make money
5008115 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5008116 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5008117 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5008118 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5008119 alternative report to swedens seventeenth and eighteenth periodical report to the committee on the international convention on ethnic and racial discrimination
5008120 the party was established by persons previously active in the nazi movement and who now do what they can to shed past associations and appear mainstream
5008121 a recent survey shows that six leading figures in the party who have held office during the past two years have in various ways supported the nazi movement by donating money to militant nazi groups
5008122 in other words the swedish state finances the activities of parties that openly proclaim racist views
5008123 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5008124 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbour against neighbour father against son
5008125 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son

5008143 based on anecdotal accounts in our discussions with online brokerages both the number of attacks and dollar volume of losses has grown over the past two years
5008144 the reason for that is that most of the controls are retrospective theyre designed to go in after the attack and find the perpetrators
5008145 those old investigative methods dont work anymore its almost impossible to track down the bad guys or hold anyone accountable so it doesnt defer anything
5008146 our software analyzes your trade in milliseconds so the brokerage can let the trader know immediately if theres a potential risk or scam going on
5008147 in that case i assume the brokerage would honor the price at the time of the trade if the customer still wanted to go through with it
5008148 itll be a few months before you see active intervention in place
5008149 whenever you change user behavior you need to put in training and education programs first
5008150 we think this will change the industry and force the fraudsters to evolve so well keep them on their toes
5008151 there is no ultimate solution for online fraud its always an iterative game just like warfare
5008152 but this is a significant escalation on the defensive side because it puts you online brokerages in front of the problem
5008153 the applicant should not be extradited to the united states before midnight on 29 august
5008154 its been promising enough that were going to amp up our discussions with other labels to grow the catalogue
5008155 ber seine krankheit m chte ich jetzt nicht mehr sprechen er ist jetzt gesund und ich bin gl cklich
5008156 einen kopf wie mit 33 aber einen k rper wie mit 23 das w re optimal
5008157 als die landung klappte war ich soooo zufrieden immerhin war es premiere ich habe den sprung zum ersten mal gezeigt auf bronze hatte ich gehofft von silber nicht getr umt
5008158 die feier steigt im deutschen haus da st ren wir fabian hamb chen nicht in seinen vorbereitungen und kommen auch ganz leise wieder ins quartier zur ck
5008159 wir k nnen das noch gar nicht realisieren mein sohn hat am telefon geweint mein mann hat geweint und ich war den tr nen nah
5008160 nat rlich habe ich auch kurz an bronze gedacht aber man w nscht ja keinem konkurrenten etwas schlechtes
5008161 jetzt kann ich am dienstag an barren und reck wieder voll angreifen
5008162 am reck w re das nicht so sch n aber bis dahin ist er wieder fit
5008163 nat rlich haben die st rze seine psyche angegriffen der druck ist immens
5008164 der finger ist wieder okay ich werde auf jeden fall starten ich werde nicht ein finale wegschenken wenn es keinen grund gibt
5008165 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
5008166 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
5008167 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
5008168 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
5008169 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
5008170 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
5008171 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
5008172 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
5008173 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off
5008174 we want the palestinians to understand that we want to live with them in peace we are ready for historic reconciliation
5008175 and this sort of release we are hopeful will help create a more positive environment between israelis and palestinians and support the process of negotiation which is ongoing
5008176 for the palestinian people the issue of prisoners is a very difficult issue a sensitive issue and we have answered positively to this request by the palestinian leadership

5008179 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5008180 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is you know above my pay grade but let me speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue is not paying attention
5008181 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5008182 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like i have taught her
5008183 we are anxious the federal government understands that there will be very significant growth in freight over the next 10 to 15 years a doubling of the freight task and 90 per cent will be export orientated
5008184 it means we can no longer look at road and rail separately but using them as a combined form of transport as part of a national supply chain
5008185 our road infrastructure is pretty good but our rail infrastructure has been under done for decades
5008186 road and rail is an integrated solution we need both as a solution
5008187 we spent time looking at rail it has to be significant infrastructure to qualify for the fund
5008188 while there has been parking made available at the rear of the centrelink building motorists are continuing to park for long periods of time on street
5008189 this is creating parking availability issues for motorists requiring short term parking options
5008190 as we know feral cats devastate native animal numbers so this is a step in the right direction in addressing the problem
5008191 its a case of pick a number it is unknown and very hard to tell how many there are out there
5008192 despite the value cats have to our lives many unwanted cats are received by shelters and animal welfare organisations while others add to the stray or feral cat populations
5008193 responsible cat ownership is the primary step in reducing the number of unwanted domestic cats and addressing the issue of stray and feral cat populations
5008194 it resulted in an increase in the number of hospital beds being used by those who would be better served by an aged care bed
5008195 its for this reason that earlier this year the rudd government set up a 300 million zero real interest loans programme to help create 2500 permanent residential aged care places in areas designated as high need
5008196 while i appreciate there are some concerns from some within the aged care sector the reality is that we have invested 300 million to fundamentally increase the number of aged care places
5008197 the rudd government has delivered an additional increase in the level of the conditional adjustment payment which was introduced in 2004 05
5008198 the cap provided additional medium term financial assistance to residential aged care providers while encouraging them to become more efficient through improved management practices
5008199 from july 1 we increased the cap level by a further 1 75 per cent so that it will reach 8 75 per cent
5008200 the value of this increase over the four years to 2011 12 is more than 407 million nationally
5008201 i have said that aged care is an issue for us all it is not about what we did as a government it is about what labor will do
5008202 the howard government commissioned a major review into aged care called the hogan report which produced major reform while i can say that towards the end of last year there was some stress in the aged care sector
5008203 as a result of the hogan reforms in 2004 05 we introduced a special cap so that aged care providers were getting inflation plus 1
5008204 the simulator is exactly the same as youd expect to find on the bridge of a working ship
5008205 the simulator has radars of different types so we can teach students general techniques involved but also the specifics involved with a particular radar they might find when they go to sea
5008206 we have screens for particular waterways and students can practise navigating in a variety of weather conditions
5008207 after a major upgrade in early 2009 well have ports and charts from all over the world
5008208 students work very hard not to hit anything from their first day but of course the beauty of the simulator is that if you do hit something it just makes a noise and you stop
5008209 some strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours and fay could be approaching hurricane strength when it reaches central cuba
5008210 a person was killed in the city of fond verettes and another was missing in the southern part of the country where
5008211 we welcome the release of any palestinian prisoner it is considered a victory for palestinians
5008212 we ask israel to change its conditions for releasing prisoners and we ask for the release of all prisoners without exception

5008227 i was responsible for the breakup of my first marriage due to my immature and very bad behavior

5008235 a small number of people who were not part of the main group seemed intent on causing problems
5008236 we have thrown our weight behind this because we think theres a difference between free speech and free expression and attacking someone for the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation
5008237 you dont expect it on your doorstep but thats life it could happen anywhere
5008238 they were a law abiding family theyve never been in trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
5008239 its quite disturbing its a small street and everyone gets on with everybody for this to happen here is quite shocking
5008240 ive seen them about they keep themselves to themselves the father speaks but the sons dont
5008241 this makes it a little bit sweeter just knowing ive been through some pretty big injuries and had some doubters
5008242 it just made me so much stronger and it made me the person i am today
5008243 its definitely been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
5008244 she grew up real quick we had to adjust everything

5008257 when you are preparing cooked food you have to follow a good recipe and that guarantees good results
5008258 we have a trick to deal with this we use the balance of five flavours one b and four ss bitter sweet sour spicy and salty when you have finished making your dish you check the colour the quantity and the texture and then you adjust the five flavours in every single sip or bite you have to have all five present bitter sweet sour spicy and salty thats what makes it gourmet and so delicious
5008259 es ist zu erkennen dass wir fu ball spielen wollen
5008260 fred hat zwar gesagt dass am anfang die ergebnisse wichtiger sind und sich die mannschaft dabei erst spielerisch weiterentwickeln muss aber die richtigen ans tze sind schon da
5008261 wir wollten dass bei der art und weise wie die mannschaft auftritt eine entwicklung zu sehen ist
5008262 diesmal war er sehr pr sent und hat nie abgeschaltet
5008263 wichtiger ist dass wir unser neues spielsystem so umsetzen wie es sich der trainer vorstellt wir spielen offensiv und erarbeiten uns viele chancen
5008264 das ist ein gutes zeichen aber keine kampfansage an die konkurrenz

5008267 working with talent the caliber of maggie q allows us to deliver an unparalleled level of storytelling that will keep players engaged in between 180 mile an hour races
5008268 the challenge facing obama is clear he must go beyond merely pointing out the folly of the iraq war he must demonstrate that iraq represents the truest manifestation of an approach to national security that is fundamentally flawed thereby helping americans discern the correct lessons of that misbegotten conflict by showing that bush has put the country on a path pointing to permanent war ever increasing debt and dependency and further abuses of executive authority obama can transform the election into a referendum on the current administrations entire national security legacy by articulating a set of principles that will safeguard the countrys vital interests both today and in the long run at a price we can afford while preserving rather than distorting the constitution obama can persuade americans to repudiate the bush legacy and to choose another course
5008269 well of course this bothers you more than usual dont you know what time of the month it is

5008274 whats more obscene saying that waterboarding is not torture or creating a waterboard thrill ride

5008277 whats more obscene saying that waterboarding is not torture or creating a waterboard thrill ride
5008278 its become very easy for society to look the other way
5008279 its really a fight for the soul of the profession
5008280 the vast majority of military psychologists know the ethics code and know exactly what they can and cannot do
5008281 this is a fight about individual psychologists behavior and we should keep it there
5008282 a principled stance against our nations policy of using psychologists to oversee abusive and coercive interrogations
5008283 it is consistent with the a p a ethics code for psychologists to serve in consultative roles to interrogation and information gathering processes for national security related purposes
5008284 health professionals bound by strong ethical imperatives to do no harm may become calibrators of harm
5008285 concentrates on isolating the detainee and fostering dependence of the detainee on his interrogator
5008286 theres no doubt that the psychologists presence can be abused
5008287 but if theres no presence at all then theres no accountability and you walk away feeling noble and righteous but you havent done a damned thing
5008288 if you take the position that interrogation cannot be done ethically then the discussion stops there
5008289 but if the answer is yes then you dont shut down the whole operation because certain individuals behaved unethically
5008290 the idea that a psychologist or psychiatrist is going to systematically unlock any prisoners resistance and provide some unique strategy is completely false its a fantasy

5008296 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5008297 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5008298 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5008299 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5008300 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5008301 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5008302 i was worried about coming to new york because itd put me closer to you
5008303 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view

5008312 i have no idea i think thats probably the first question i dont know the answer to
5008313 all of us kept telling each other we shouldnt be doing this
5008314 my mind set the whole time was why are we doing this
5008315 we immediately instituted a search for the defendant in order to absolve ourselves of liability
5008316 i got caught up in this i made a bad judgment im a screw up
5008317 asked what he did to earn an income roque reluctantly said he was a drug dealer
5008318 he said i dont fight or destroy people he said that he had a lot of friends and that they owed him
5008319 he portrayed himself as a modern day robin hood he said that he is known on the street as cuba he said that he helped people in various ways to include paying their rent and that his assistance was sometimes offered via illegal activities
5008320 roque said that he could provide information on organized crime narcotics and other illicit activity
5008321 he said that he also had information on the whereabouts of what he described as a united states army missile
5008322 detective hayes informed me and mike savant that she was going to take defendant and book him into pierce county jail
5008323 i overheard her ask one of the unknown federal officers to book defendant into jail on her behalf
5008324 liberty bail bonds personnel relinquished custody of roque to us and we were allowed to transport him to tacoma police headquarters to meet with federal agents
5008325 roque agreed to assist on the condition that he could be at home with his daughters
5008326 we explained that we could not make any promises to him and he was told that even if he didnt go to jail state charges could be filed later
5008327 a 3 5 inch bazooka rocket practice round with motor
5008328 it had a certain amount of propulsion just enough explosive material to propel it some distance for training it was not an immediate threat
5008329 i dont want to underplay the danger but its unlikely that there was an immediate danger to anybody in the neighborhood
5008330 mark came back and said to me well im not signing off on this
5008331 he told me that there was no way that he was in agreement that this was a valid surrender
5008332 in this particular case i didnt think it was worth letting go of a good bond
5008333 the surrender shall be made to the facility in which the person was originally held in custody or the county or city jail affiliated with the court issuing the warrant resulting in bail
5008334 once the bondsman surrenders the defendant at the jail the bondsman is off the hook
5008335 youve got a prosecutor who doesnt see the gray in the world
5008336 hes never worked on the other side to experience and understand the street smarts of it how things work the letter of the law doesnt necessarily incorporate the practical application of things
5008337 i wish it was only 10 000 and we could have rolled the dice and let a court of law decide but it was 150 000 and with that comes consequences
5008338 im gonna kill you you son of a bitch you touch my family ill kill you
5008339 this guy was never in one place for more than 10 minutes
5008340 i dont have any problem with anything tpd and the fbi were doing
5008341 why does the prosecutor get to let this guy walk after he admits he robbed me somewhere along the line i got screwed

5008346 he learnt a lot of things at cambridge but he learnt how to duck for the line there
5008347 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5008348 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5008349 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5008350 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5008351 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5008352 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5008353 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5008354 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5008355 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5008356 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5008357 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5008358 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5008359 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5008360 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government
5008361 once they have cleared it we will be presenting it as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5008362 president musharraf says he will not bow to these pressures will not quit and will defend himself
5008363 we want stability in the country we want political stability we want to make progress in the light of the mandate that has been given to our government
5008364 all of us kept telling each other we shouldnt be doing this
5008365 my mind set the whole time was why are we doing this

5008471 you feel terry will give 100 percent whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances
5008472 but ferdinand might find an extra 10 percent in his game by being captain
5008473 ive noticed with ferdinand the bigger the stage the better he plays he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games
5008474 by giving ferdinand the responsibility of leading his country out you almost guarantee world class performances from him

5008485 i think hes got speed and we need some help on the outside he might be one of the fastest guys on the team its different when hes running an out from the outside than from inside we have two more weeks so hell get it hell be a threat i think he can be great on the outside
5008486 nasca said the reads on the outside are less complicated than in the slot and coaches envision him stretching the defense with his speed

5008624 its now up to the australian government to keep watch on the whaling fleet for as long as possible preferably as long as it remains in the southern ocean
5008625 during his visit to tokyo next week foreign affairs minister stephen smith must gain confirmation that the japanese government will not build a new whaling factory ship to replace the aging nisshin maru a new and larger factory ship would commit japan to whaling for another 40 years
5008626 the orion was undertaking routine surveillance against illegal unreported and unregulated fishing in the southern ocean in support of the commission for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources inspection system
5008627 new zealand is strongly opposed to japans whaling in the southern ocean at the same time the safety of human life at sea is a responsibility new zealand takes very seriously we are also deeply concerned about the risk to human life and to antarcticas pristine marine environment should the japanese whaling fleet encounter problems at sea

5008630 dexter is the most distant ive said that no one should give him any money and then hell have to get a job but he just wont get one
5008631 talking to him is like talking to darnell times ten hed shut you down in five seconds
5008632 weve had psychologists come over to the house and he has an answer for everything hes so intelligent but hes too intelligent for his own good
5008633 the two topics of conversation we have in our family are how to help dexter or how we can improve the businesses

5008643 we need equipment we need instruments we need a lot of technical help
5008644 these deals themselves are not likely to be hugely lucrative
5008645 do this automatically for files like this from no on
5008646 quem n o conhece a hist ria corre o risco de repeti la
5008647 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5008648 you can make these up to one week in advance
5008649 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5008650 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5008651 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5008652 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5008653 we are excited to be hosting the playoffs for the next three years and happy to have the ability to play in monroe as we work on the next phase of getting a permanent facility for the team
5008654 we have a great staff with our head coach and general manager both returning for year three the outlook is very positive working to get a long term deal was important to us our sponsors and our fans with what has happened in seattle with the nba we wanted to secure long term deals so everyone could enjoy explosion basketball without any worries
5008655 the explosion professionalism is what prompted me as commissioner to contact them about a three year deal in hosting the tournament
5008656 we didnt even blink we kept going we believe in one another
5008657 our starting five you put that starting five anywhere in the world and were going to win
5008658 and you bring our backup five in and you put that five anywhere in the world and were going to win too its one of those situations where were just deep
5008659 go with both chrises and you throw in dwyane wade its unbelievable
5008660 his athletic ability his speed he looks like a rookie out there
5008661 i think our bench has been able to give our starters a lift because our starters have to be out there to start the game and sometimes other teams give them their best shot
5008662 we come in and give them a lift and then they come back in and blow it wide open for us in the third quarter
5008663 were all studs we come in the game with the same mentality the same confidence that we play with back with our nba teams when we come in we try to give them a lift
5008664 when we come off the bench we really try to come in with a lot of intensity especially on the defensive end
5008665 the starters they get our team going when we come in we want to be that second wave if the other team still has their starters in were bringing in fresh legs
5008666 im ignorant and dont really have anything of value to add to this discussion so ill just throw out the nastiest thing i can think of
5008667 34 where the rubrics prescribe the clara voce the celebrant must recite the prayers loud enough so that the faithful can properly and conveniently follow the sacred rites this must be given special attention in a large church and before a large congregation
5008668 o terceiro andar onde ficava a maior sala de espet culos do teatro foi totalmente destru da pelo fogo mas o t rreo e o subsolo do teatro n o foram atingidos

5008672 you have to convince people that they are not just sheeple
5008673 just tell them that all the scientist agree that it is real and they are smarter then them so they need just accept it any scientists that say its not real are just kooks or bought off by big oil
5008674 dont forget if all else fails the kids bring up the kids
5008675 for years they the chicken little crowd have been doing their very best to create mass hysteria
5008676 we know how to change behavior and attitudes that is what we do
5008677 we know what messages will work and what will not
5008678 people know outside is going to feel much better for them but underpredict how happy theyre going to feel after being outside in nature even 15 minutes
5008679 the people inside overestimate their happiness about being inside its this error in judgment people have about how happy they are in a different environment that may explain why people dont spend more time in nature
5008680 rather than changing their ways to protect the environment the results of this study suggest that these people may give up on their efforts to protect the environment
5008681 i think most people recognize we face a severe environmental crisis but its hard to deal with that head on because most people feel helpless to do anything about it
5008682 if we look at the nature of the problem it is so big its hard to know what any individual can do in their own life to make a difference
5008683 the tendency when people are confronted with an overwhelming problem is to run away from it so psychologists are very experienced in dealing with that
5008684 one of the first things you think of is turning off lights when you leave a room or changing the thermostat settings in the house they dont think first of caulking windows or upgrading your furnace
5008685 more insulation in the attic and tight windows make more difference than changing the thermostat setting having a more fuel efficient car makes more difference than any amount youre likely to decrease driving
5008686 people showed strong approval for other students who recycled you would hope to see people disapprove of people who dont recycle but they didnt disapprove
5008687 we are recognizing that environmental problems have a tremendous impact on many aspects of our lives but we need a lot more work
5008688 we cant afford to let this increased environmental concern become just another fashionable trend
5008689 find me something else to put in my tank besides the last of the oil
5008690 lol anonymous you forgot to mention that exxon mobile made 1400 per sec paid 4000 in taxes per sec 15000 in cost per second 1 billion a day in operating costs which works out to about 8 7 profit per year i can make more profit than that selling hamburgers
5008691 i need my friends at cisco or ibm to reboot my modem
5008692 i have so much emotions going through my head so much excitement the biggest thing is nothings impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is a little imagination
5008693 for decades people are going to be talking about what hes doing
5008694 hes been breaking world records by two three seconds who does that whos done that besides him ever
5008695 every time i watch him swim im more and more in awe of what he does
5008696 i think being his teammate and being part of the team while hes doing all this kind of gives us a different perspective years and years down the road people will realize more and more how amazing and how special he is
5008697 i have so much emotions going through my head so much excitement the biggest thing is nothings impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is a little imagination

5008704 no all four rounds he didnt do what we were telling him
5008705 third round i came out firing i was thinking that maybe id be up by two points but they said it was tied up
5008706 in that last round i went in there with my hands up i know i hit him with a straight left he caught me with the hook ill give them that but i think i caught him with two more punches and should have won the fight 8 7
5008707 we wanted him to box but the main thing we wanted him to do was get up early get ahead first we knew he had faster hands and more power so we wanted him to engage and make the guy have to come to him
5008708 instead they started playing the waiting game from the beginning we yelled at him talked to him between rounds but he basically did the opposite of what we asked him to do
5008709 one of the things we know is that these kids have been calling home so often
5008710 what happens is they get instructions all the way from the united states you can tell the difference because once the bell rings they start doing what their other coaches tell them
5008711 they were trying to tell me to just go at him go at him
5008712 im not that type of fighter to go out there and throw punches if i do that im going to get caught with shots i want to go out there and play it smart
5008713 luis was actually a very aggressive boxer until tonight one of the things thats always helped luis is his aggression but for some reason tonight he decided to stand back and wait and it cost him
5008714 before i came up here i talked to my dad its hard i feel like i let him down
5008715 yes i was born in russia but since for so many years ive lived in the u s i feel i represent the united states of america
5008716 i feel like im more of an american than a russian but im very proud of my heritage and proud of being a russian
5008717 i go back at least once a year and visit my grandparents and my family and friends
5008718 it makes it so special to me i always feel a little more russian when im there
5008719 it is a pity that nastya sic is now an american
5008720 i definitely feel that i went out there today and represented both countries
5008721 i am competing for the u s but with my name being nastia i hope i made my family and fans proud in russia as well as in the united states
5008722 america gave me many opportunities i dont think i would have been able to achieve the same results in russia 15 years ago it was just not possible
5008723 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5008724 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5008725 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5008726 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5008727 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5008762 pozdnyakov is one of the greatest fencers of all time
5008763 i was really fortunate today to stick with the game plan that we developed nobody expected us to but we showed that we can work and do really well
5008764 we wanted to win a medal in every relay and we achieved that we wanted to score the most medals that weve ever scored before and we achieved that
5008765 we also probably wanted to score the most gold medals of anybody but we didnt quite get there we were one short of athens and two short of melbourne but one more than sydney
5008766 we go home with a lot of our goals achieved but still room to improve and still places to go
5008767 i think we underestimated the emotional cost the highs have on people
5008768 theres got to be at least 25 000 hidden in your house we can help you find it

5008772 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5008773 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5008774 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5008775 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5008776 it was really hard to go back into the gym after what happened but i kept training

5008782 i dont see how consumer spending turns around anytime before the second half of 2009
5008783 where are the new sources of funds coming from for the consumer clearly the earnings reports show that we are living in a discretionary versus nondiscretionary world
5008784 we want the palestinians to understand that we want to live with them in peace we are ready for historic reconciliation
5008785 and this sort of release we are hopeful will help create a more positive environment between israelis and palestinians and support the process of negotiation which is ongoing
5008786 for the palestinian people the issue of prisoners is a very difficult issue a sensitive issue and we have answered positively to this request by the palestinian leadership
5008787 most of the chinese competitors fully displayed their abilities to achieve good results on home soil
5008788 we are especially pleased by our athletes in judo shooting and weightlifting but every single medal is meaningful in its own way and won through painstaking efforts by our athletes

5008802 i have dreamed of a lot of things and i have written down a lot of goals and this was the biggest one i really ever wrote down and everything was accomplished it has been a fun last four years and it has been one fun week that is for sure
5008803 getting to know everybody on the team is one of the greatest memories just being able to be a part of team usa and be a part of the u s olympic swimming team
5008804 that is one of the greatest memories i will have from this
5008805 you know i used to hate donny and marie but after seeing their images defacing one of the most venerable hotels in las vegas i think i might reconsider
5008806 not yet i think it will be in the next minutes
5008807 i did whatever i could it hurt me in the back end but its what i needed to do
5008808 i just did whatever i could to hold him off im so happy with this im so happy
5008809 what was really hard was to compete on the last day you kept waiting around i was being psyched up by the team and i like that the guys really supported me
5008810 we held our own we made our finals we did what we came here to do
5008811 no matter how i felt for me it was all about the race thats all i could think about thats all the mattered

5008814 this is my third medal in the olympic games and ive enjoyed it like never before
5008815 im really happy to win this medal because its not easy to be in the last position
5008816 it is amazing to go to three olympics and get three medals
5008817 ive got to admit that i was very nervous today it was quite complicated but im happy with this win
5008818 he babied himself today and he needs to grow up
5008819 i cant stand that football is a game where you get knocked around and its a game of bumps and bruises and thats what happens live with it
5008820 larry has done pretty well this is what some of the younger guys dont understand there is playing football and then there is playing our way of football it may sound like an awful egotistical self serving thing to say but there is our way of playing football
5008821 we play fast we get to the ball and we hit
5008822 we do all of the little things that the other guys wish their teams did when the recruits come in here they have to understand that they have to take what they have and take it to another level were not asking them to do it were going to demand that they do it
5008823 youre going to have to play when youre tired and larry found that out today
5008824 hes going to have to push himself when hes tired because thats what good football players do good football players play hurt good football players push themselves when they get tired good football players go above and beyond what they have to larry is a good football player and hes going to do all of those things it just has to be made known to him that there are no exceptions thats the rule
5008825 were very athletic but i think we have to get better
5008826 we make way too many mistakes and i think our conditioning has to get better as a unit we have to be ready to go eight nine plays in a row and i dont think were there yet i think they learn quickly they are easy to coach and theyre good kids
5008827 a guy can be good but he may not be ready to be put in the game just yet in a rotation
5008828 if you think of a baseball rotation its the same thing every fourth or fifth day you are going to pitch you have x amount of guys that you are going to rotate in and out of the game so you have a number of guys that can play different positions
5008829 if someone wants to get snot nosed with us and try to push the ball down our throat i want to get the big guys out there who can hang in there with them
5008830 this gives me some flexibility and i can add julian to that too because hes getting better by the week
5008831 theres a little bit of rust and there has to be
5008832 its not as much rust as you think the more hell play the better hell be i have no worries about because hell fit right in and he has fit right in already
5008833 no coach ever thinks he has enough depth and im one of them
5008834 ik denk het een normaal fenomeen is omdat de banken en de postkantoren beter beschermd zijn dan de apothekers we leven in een maatschappij waarin meer en meer mensen geld nodig hebben ik denk dat dat de reden is
5008835 ik heb ervoor gezorgd dat de mensen niet kunnen zien wat er achteraan gebeurt zodat ze niet weten of daar iemand is de toonbank is ook meer afgesloten zodat ze minder makkelijk achter de toonbank kunnen komen
5008836 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5008837 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5008838 this has no effect whatsoever on the canadian mission its not a development
5008839 the taliban demonstrates time and again its willingness to target civilians including afghan civilians as part of their efforts
5008840 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you
5008841 but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again
5008842 moving to rancho cucamonga is most advantageous because it opens us up to more opportunities in the development world many of our clients see the cajon pass as sort of a mental barrier they dont want to make the trek up the hill to see what the high desert is all about if i bring the company to them i can show them what weve been able to accomplish in victorville phelan and apple valley then theyre more open to proceeding with projects in the high desert but im not going to lie its a tough sell

5008853 when people ask if youve failed on a test you know theyre asking if youve gotten a b asian fail or a d white fail
5008854 over the past 10 years the proportion of white students at lynbrook has fallen by nearly half to 25 of the student body
5008855 for the asian students this double standard is another pressure factor on top of all the other expectations their parents and relatives have for them for white and other minority students the double standard makes them feel inferior or at best confused about their identity
5008856 as an asian student i know this side best when the question of failure concerns school life it is assumed theyre asking whether youve taken four ap classes or none or if youve held any leadership positions at school or if your gpa is above a 3 5
5008857 being a genius in areas of math and science after going to an ivy league college while majoring in electrical engineering
5008858 i have a friend who was accepted into an ivy league college planning to major in mass communications she was not given as much credit as another student going to the same school and planning to major in electrical engineering and computer science
5008859 the double standard discourages achievement even if a white student is a brilliant mathematician he is inclined to take the easier and less challenging math class rather than the ap course with all the asian students but when a white student is considered less athletic than expectations demand the student is considered different an outcast of the group
5008860 differences in others are inherently threatening mandating excommunication from the tribe of peers to be avoided at all costs lest you too be perceived as weird and banished it is such peer culture not peer pressure that rules the world
5008861 because these expectations are so intricately interwoven in our daily lives itll take some un brainwashing
5008862 water as we know it does not exist within our bodies
5008863 water in our bodies has different physical properties from ordinary bulk water because of the presence of proteins and other biomolecules proteins change the properties of water to perform particular tasks in different parts of our cells
5008864 water can be viewed as a designer fluid in living cells
5008865 our experiments showed that the volume of active water was about the same size as that of the protein
5008866 we previously thought proteins would affect only those water molecules directly stuck to them
5008867 now we know proteins will affect a volume of water comparable to their own thats pretty amazing
5008868 it is pretty special and i am massively relieved to get it over and done with i am a very happy man
5008869 what do you need this closet to do for you
5008870 do what you feel in your heart to be right for youll be criticized anyway
5008871 when we stepped on the field we knew we could do it
5008872 any time you can compete with the best it will give hope to the young ladies at home to believe that they can do it and play at the highest level
5008873 it took us 29 years six months and 13 days to get softball into the olympics
5008874 now weve got 13 months to get it back in
5008875 i was landing a lot of punches but the judges were not giving them to me
5008876 its tough for the kids back home who want to take up boxing because if they come to the olympics to be treated like this theres no point in coming at all
5008877 if weather conditions are favorable beijings air quality will be excellent
5008878 so the city fathers who are trying to reduce this are only working on half the problem
5008879 you can control beijing as much as you like but the provinces are a different story they are so spread out and they dont come under the same control as beijing
5008880 the south is a strong source of emissions the winds pick it up and carry it into beijing adding to the local concentrations here then a clean wind from the north comes through and the cycle repeats itself this is the story of air pollution in beijing
5008881 i think beijing itself has done as much as you could expect i think what theyve done is controlled what they can and that has had some effect if they hadnt done it it would be worse
5008882 i was being asked questions especially from reporters who had just arrived it was almost impossible for them to believe that beijing can have blue sky days

5008893 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5008894 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5008895 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5008896 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5008897 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5008898 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5008899 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5008900 as well as reinforcing the citys position as a world class conference destination it will bring 10 9 million of economic benefit to the tourism industry in glasgow and the surrounding areas
5008901 scotland is known to have produced some of the worlds leading medical figures so naturally we are delighted that a city as diverse and dynamic as glasgow will host the 12th world congress on pain
5008902 its a positive move for glasgow and the people of scotland i hope that seeing such an important event take place here means that pain services across the nhs are going to improve for the benefit of peoples health
5008903 we are not only able to produce standard quality fertilizer but also manage waste in efficiently which not only helped reduce the burden on the municipal corporation but also to scale down our demand for fertilizer
5008904 if there is a mechanism to separate waste at the source and to compost degradable waste it will not only help lengthen the age of the landfill site at sisdole but also save the cost of waste transportation
5008905 it has gradually become popular and is in demand in the valley as it is 100 percent organic safe non toxic and odor free
5008906 as its operation is simple many locals are opting for this technology in their households as well
5008907 composting of waste results in a commercially viable product and is technically feasible
5008908 if neighboring india and singapore can export compost fertilizer why cant we
5008909 on the side up high down low youre too slow
5008910 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5008911 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5008912 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5008913 the reason probably i won this title is because i have a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village that was amazing experience for me always was a pleasure to know new people no
5008914 i have chances in the second set and i didnt take it
5008915 after that rafa was dominating he was make me run a lot hes a great champion because he has been winning every important tournament in the past months

5008918 theres a real concern that russia has turned a corner here and is headed back to its past rather than its future
5008919 the fact is we have worked hard to bring them the russians into the community of nations we thought they were headed in that direction
5008920 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5008921 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5008922 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5008923 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5008924 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5008925 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5008926 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5008927 weve agreed not to even make the interceptors operational until the iranians have test launched a missile that has the range to hit much of western europe not to mention russia
5008928 so this is really an old song that theyre singing and it really just doesnt play
5008929 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5008930 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5008931 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5008932 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5008933 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5008934 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5008935 if weather conditions are favorable beijings air quality will be excellent
5008936 so the city fathers who are trying to reduce this are only working on half the problem
5008937 you can control beijing as much as you like but the provinces are a different story they are so spread out and they dont come under the same control as beijing

5008939 i think beijing itself has done as much as you could expect i think what theyve done is controlled what they can and that has had some effect if they hadnt done it it would be worse
5008940 i was being asked questions especially from reporters who had just arrived it was almost impossible for them to believe that beijing can have blue sky days
5008941 i was trying to achieve the impossible because the amount of running i had done wasnt enough
5008942 i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg
5008943 i was going to get to the finish line no matter what because that was my race

5008989 if my comments brought pain to anyone i certainly did not intend for this to happen and apologize for any such reaction i especially appeal to my many listeners in the gay community to accept my apologies for any inadvertent insults which may have occurred
5008990 the media and others are reporting this as if it were intentional and it was not i repeat this was nothing more than the unintentional mispronunciation of another persons name that sounded like something that it was not
5008991 there are various ways to mispronounce my name but that one i think is least common
5008992 if i offended arab americans i regret my choice of words

5008998 the eyes of the angel are fixed on the throne of allah because he is afraid the command will come and he will not have time to turn his sight so he has fixed his eyes on the arsh waiting for the command to come his eyes are like two bright stars

5009000 the greatest and the best day the sun has risen over is the day of jumah friday in that day adam was created in that day he entered into jannah and in that day he was driven out of jannah and on that day the hour will occur
5009001 all of the days were presented to me so i saw the day of friday it looked like a white mirror very bright and clean but in the middle there was a dark spot so i asked what was the dark spot and i was told that it was the hour
5009002 the best day the sun has risen over is friday on that day adam was created on that day he came down to earth on that day allah accepted his repentance on that day he died on that day the hour will occur
5009003 every animal is worried on the day of jumah from the time of fajr because they know that is when the hour will occur except jinn and humans
5009004 and the trumpet will be blown and all who are on the earth will swoon away except him whom allah wills then it will be blown a second time and behold they will be standing looking on
5009005 the right opinion is that there is no evidence to support any of this all of them are possible
5009006 where is the one who was asking about the hour
5009007 o allah we want from you knowledge that will benefit us and we seek refuge in you from the knowledge that does not benefit us
5009008 i did not prepare for it a lot of fasting and prayer but i have prepared for it with love for allah and his messenger
5009009 and the trumpet will be blown and behold from the graves they will come out quickly to their lord they will say woe to us who has raised us up from our place of sleep this is what the most gracious has promised us and the messengers spoke the truth it will be but a single shout and behold they will all be bought before us
5009010 how will you save yourselves from a day if you disbelieve that will make a child gray headed
5009011 and it is allah who sends the winds so that they raise up the clouds and we drive them to a dead land and revive the earth therewith after its death as such will be the resurrection
5009012 i am the leader of mankind on the day of judgement and i am the first one whose grave will open on the day of judgement
5009013 in the name of the one who revealed the tawrah on musa
5009014 do not prefer me over musa because i will be the first one to come out of his grave but i will find that musa is already holding onto the throne of allah subhaana wa taaala so i do not know whether he was included in the ones who were dead in the first blow or not
5009015 this is the day in which allah has saved musa from firawn
5009016 musa belongs to us more than he does to them so we should fast this day
5009017 wheresoever you may be allah will bring you together on the day of resurrection truly allah is able to do all things
5009018 we bought them together we did not leave any one of them
5009019 on the day of judgment allah subhaana wa taaala will assemble all of the creation the beasts the birds even the insects everything and allah subhaana wa taaala will be just on that day because his name is the just al adl and of the justice of allah subhaana wa taaala allah will take revenge for the goat that did not have horns from the goat that did have horns
5009020 and the non believer will say i wish that i am dirt
5009021 as we began the first creation we shall repeat it it is a promise binding upon us truly we shall do it
5009022 o allahs apostle will the men and the women look at each other
5009023 the situation will be too hard for them to pay attention to that
5009024 and then i will be dressed next with a dress from jannah that no one would have similar to
5009025 on the day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens and they all creatures will appear before allah the one the irresistible
5009026 and when the earth is stretched forth and has cast out all that was in it and became empty
5009027 the people will be assembled on the day of judgment on a wide land that is afraa
5009028 think they not that they will be resurrected for reckoning on a great day li yowmin adheem the day when all mankind will stand before the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
5009029 verily these disbelievers love the present life of this world and put behind them a heavy day
5009030 o mankind fear your lord and be dutiful to him verily the earthquake of the hour of judgement is a terrible thing the day you shall see it every nursing mother will forget her nursling and every pregnant one will drop her load and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state yet they will not be drunken but severe will be the torment of allah
5009031 consider not that allah is unaware of that which the zalimun polytheists wrong doers etc do but he gives them respite up to a day when the eyes will stare in horror they will be hastening forward with necks outstretched their heads raised up towards the sky their gaze returning not towards them and their hearts empty from thinking because of extreme fear
5009032 then when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that day nor will they ask of one another
5009033 then when there comes as saakhah the day of resurrections second blowing of trumpet that day shall a man flee from his brother and from his mother and his father and from his wife and his children every man that day will have enough to make him careless of others
5009034 and if every person who had wronged by disbelieving in allah and by worshipping others besides allah possessed all that is on earth and sought to ransom himself therewith it will not be accepted and they would feel in their hearts regret when they see the torment and they will be judged with justice and no wrong will be done unto them
5009035 verily those who disbelieved and died while they were disbelievers the whole earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them even if they offered it as a ransom
5009036 people are sleeping and they wake up when they die
5009037 a disbeliever will be brought on the day of resurrection and will be asked suppose you had as much gold as to fill the earth would you offer it to ransom yourself
5009038 the mujrim criminal sinner disbeliever etc would desire to ransom himself from the punishment of that day by his children and his wife and his brother and his kindred who sheltered him and all that are in the earth so that it might save him
5009039 o followers of muhammad by allah if you knew what i know you would weep much and laugh little
5009040 o my brother nephew the man was younger than him did allah subhaana wa taaala promise you that he will free you from hellfire
5009041 did allah promise you that he will give you jannah
5009042 if one of you is being dragged on his face from the day that he is born until the day that he dies and he is doing that for the sake of allah he would view that as insignificant and nothing on the day of judgment
5009043 make the best day of our days the day that we meet you
5009044 the day they see it it will be as if they had not tarried in this world except an afternoon or a morning
5009045 serve the world according to the time you are going to spend in it and work for akhirah according to the time youre going to spend in it
5009046 verily we have adorned the near heaven with the stars for beauty
5009047 they made not a just estimate of allah such as is due to him and on the day of resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by his hand and the heavens will be rolled up in his right hand
5009048 and the earth and the mountains shall be removed from their places and crushed with a single crushing
5009049 and the heaven will split asunder for that day it the heaven will be frail weak and torn up

5009260 una delle grandi conquiste dellumanit ha sottolineato benedetto xvi infatti proprio il superamento del razzismo purtroppo per di esso si registrano in diversi paesi nuove manifestazioni preoccupanti legate spesso a problemi sociali ed economici che tuttavia mai possono giustificare il disprezzo e la discriminazione razziale

5009292 until now the true story of john lennon s childhood has never been told john s sister julia has herself been on a personal journey that has made it possible only now to reveal the full extent of the pain and difficulties as well as the happier times living inside john lennon s family brought julia reveals the various strong self willed and selfish women who surrounded john as he grew up john was removed from his mother at the age of 5 to live with his aunt mimi and here julia shows for the first time the cruelty of this decision to both mother and son she sheds a new light on his upbringing with mimi which is often at dramatic odds with the accepted tale john s frequent visits to his mother and sisters gave him the liveliness freedom and love he sought and allowed him to develop his musical talents the tragic death of their mother knocked down outside aunt mimi s house by a speeding car when john was 17 meant that life for him and his sisters would never be the same again poignant raw and beautifully written imagine this casts john lennon s life in a new light and reveals the source of his emotional fragility and musical genius it is also one family s extraordinary story of how it dealt with fame and tragedy beyond all imagining

5009304 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5009305 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5009306 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5009307 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5009308 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5009331 titolo in tasca ho avuto un dejavu come nel 2001 quando a brno biaggi fin a terra come passo eravamo pi vicini alla ducati vittoria fondamentale
5009332 penso che la vittoria a laguna non ha scardinato certezze in stoner ma stata molto importante per me ha detto stata importante per il mio morale e quello della squadra per tre gare stoner ci ha fatto davvero paura stato difficile per noi reagire ma a laguna abbiamo dimostrato che possiamo batterlo oggi stato pi facile che a laguna perch eravamo pi vicini alla ducati come passo e 50 punti di vantaggio in campionato sono importanti
5009333 oggi jerry burgess il mio capo meccanico ha tirato fuori una modifichina allultimo secondo che ci ha fatto guadagnare altri due decimi in alcune curve della pista dove perdevamo ha spiegato rossi abbiamo migliorato il bilanciamento dei pesi allanteriore la moto curvava meglio avevo anche le gomme giuste per andare forte fino alla fine stoner andava forte ma pensavo di poter recuperare lo vedevo in difficolt poi sfortunatamente scivolato stava andando forte pu capitare

5009337 we dont have the resources to do what the federal government is supposed to do in terms of immigration enforcement
5009338 right now my concern is the safety of monmouth county residents if i can keep a person in jail with an extra background check when that person is a risk to commit a crime thats the best i can do
5009339 its a shame that she guadagno doesnt feel the importance of implementing the full 287 g program in monmouth county a shame because of the immense expense that the illegal aliens have brought to this state
5009340 what the sheriff wants to do in monmouth county is venture into an aspect of the 287 g program and what she is proposing is something we oppose
5009341 this new booking procedure is not necessary local police and corrections officers are already overburdened and to create an additional responsibility for them in the specialized area of immigration law is bad law enforcement you will be taking away corrections officers from other training so they can be trained for this
5009342 when we arrest somebody we generally check warrants and that is going to pretty much show us what we need to know
5009343 we do work with the federal immigration agents from time to time and we gain information from that process
5009344 this program could prove to be most beneficial to freehold and other towns in monmouth county who share our frustration with the burdens brought about by illegal immigration
5009345 i talked to latino groups who had concerns we would be expanding our patrols but thats not warranted because were only modifying our intake procedures at the back doors of our jail
5009346 ive spoken to mayor wilson and others about 287 g weve had open discussions and well continue to have discussions its a balance were doing the best we can with the resources we have
5009347 had an ongoing argument with kim guadagno since she was running in the election for sheriff last year when she first mentioned looking at 287 g our concern is that those extra immigration authority tactics can somehow be manipulated to spread out to local patrolling authorities and impact the communities instead of a community working toward a smooth assimilation people will be wondering whos behind them ready to tap them on the shoulder
5009348 the 287 g is totally counterproductive to the ability of police at any level to protect people if an immigrant knows that any law officer is also an immigration officer they are not going to call them not as a crime witness or a victim
5009349 merely checking prison detainees is just not enough we need more being done to ensure the safety of american citizens just think of all the criminals that could be apprehended during lets say a routine road check or stop
5009350 crimes that possibly could be avoided if the criminals are caught before they repeat offenses we must remember that an illegal alien who does not have the right to be here in this country does not have the same constitutional rights as an american citizen the only rights they may have is that of human rights
5009351 dont settle for the one you can live with settle for the one you cant live without
5009352 i think that sums it up lastly i dont expect any more than im willing to give so i just ask that you be yourself being comfortable in your own skin is sexy and if we click then thats great

5009359 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5009360 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else

5009370 what does feeling that i am good have to do with whether or not one is actually a good person

5009375 only that you remain in awe of god your lord so that you will follow all his paths and love him serving god your lord with all your heart and with all your soul you must keep gods commandments and decrees so that all good will be yours
5009376 and it shall be if you hearken to my commandments which i command you this day

5009386 right to play was founded on the idea that every child should have the right to play and that when children play the world wins
5009387 with our extensive roster of athlete ambassadors from over 40 countries we wanted to tap into the power of the games to connect people in support of our programs that bring sport and play to children all over the world we are delighted that lenovo has joined us in this effort to raise funds
5009388 lenovo wants to create new ways to help fans experience these olympic games
5009389 the right to play olympic memorabilia auction is a great way to make connections between fans and athletes athletes are supporting a worthwhile cause inspiring fans to do the same thing and giving them a chance to own a piece of olympic history
5009390 i had the opportunity to experience what right to play does first hand when i visited liberia in 2007
5009391 i was so moved by the positive impact that right to play programs had on children and their communities being around these children and seeing the difference that sport can make in their lives was a life changing event i hope that as 2008 olympians we will rise to the challenge and make some valuable contributions to this great initiative
5009392 like the olympic games right to play and lenovo are dedicated to putting teamwork and sportsmanship into action
5009393 theyre using the olympic games as a platform to do some really great work the auction is a worthwhile cause that im happy to be a part of dont miss your chance to bid now
5009394 people were concerned about the downturn in the u s but we were saying its not just the u s
5009395 its everywhere its europe its australia its asia japan contracted and china is slowing their growth rate may still be over eight per cent next year too but they are such a highly leveraged economy in terms of the need to pump out tons of stuff to feed people and a slowdown from 10 to eight or nine for them is catastrophic
5009396 all i was trying to say to people before was its not true that demand is driving commodity prices and the dollar right now
5009397 people didnt want to believe that because it meant that parabolic spikes could continue indefinitely prices could go to the sky and all that
5009398 the fact of the matter was that its a typical scenario just like in the tech run when you had big gains attracting big dollars people chasing and then you have the self fulfilling momentum of things going up because people are getting long just because
5009399 you have the whole strengthening u s currency which takes money away from commodities and youve got demand destruction because of the slowdown in the overall economies
5009400 and it will come its just dont be too quick in there because youre going to lose your shirt
5009401 have some cash be defensive still because the correction is ongoing

5009408 you have a high grade inoperable tumour in your brain which basically means that the tumour which is in your brain cannot be operated on this is simply because we cannot operate without killing you in the process so basically if youd like to proceed with the operation youd have to be dead halt redundancy check the operation is supposed to keep you alive and that is already redundant on its own operating would be a waste of time effort and money so to put it in simpler words you have one week i suggest you spend that week with your family if you have one
5009409 yes ironic yes i guess it is cest la vie eh
5009410 i was just kidding you do not have any tumour at all in fact you are extremely healthy except for the early signs of arthritis on your fingers typical wear and tear it is perfectly normal it looks like the army did you some good after all kim
5009411 do you believe in the teachings of our savior and lord jesus christ

5009413 yeah just think how great the world would be if everyone would just be good i mean wouldnt that be great
5009414 of course it would but lets face it thats never going to happen
5009415 no thats why we need the list of whos naughty and whos nice as a present to all of the nice people they get to enjoy all of the benefits of the constitution and the bill of rights

5009417 alguna vez has querido no hacer nada solamente respirar despertar y quedar desocupado y la otra pregunta es qu cosas son las que te motivan dia a dia para hacer lo ke haces por ejemplo que te motiva estudiar o trabajar sobretodo cuando tienes la sensaci n de estar en un viaje largo que no tiene escalas que el tiempo avanza y avanza y no te das cuenta de cuan rapido has llegado donde estas y ni siquiera te diste el tiempo para meditarlo espero alguna reflexion
5009418 creo que entiendo plenamente tus palabras la primera respuesta es s y no me gusta despertar y respirar y tambi n quedarme quieto y observar y meditar pero quedar desocupado creo que es una falta de motivaci n siempre hay algo que hacer algo que se puede hacer o algo que se debe hacer incluso en el reposo haces permites muchas cosas por ejemplo permites que las cosas sucedan sin interferir en ellas ahora la segunda respuesta creo que un pilar importante de mi motivaci n es que me gusta lo que hago y me motiva tb el poder aprender y tratar de ser mejor que antes los objetivos son comunes pero las motivaciones son personales cada uno encuentra dentro de s la raz n por la cual quiere vivir el viaje se vuelve largo si antes de tiempo empezamos a mirar el horizonte esperando llegar a nuestro destino pronto o por lo menos ver cu nto nos falta creo que nuestro viaje es para aprender del camino que nos toca recorrer para estar preparados cuando lleguemos a destino en tu frase est tu respuesta porque como dices al no darte tiempo para la reflexi n entonces el tiempo parece avanzar sin detenerse cuando no nos tomamos un tiempo para reflexionar acerca de las cosas que vivimos o para poder decidir sobre pr ximos pasos en la vida o por ltimo para analizar las cosas que nos est n pasando entonces nos parece que todo pasa tan de prisa y apenas nos damos cuenta de las cosas que vivimos es cierto que el tiempo avanza pero tambi n es cierto que hay un tiempo para todo incluso para tomar las escalas que el mismo camino prepara para nosotros y ese mismo tiempo muchas veces es de reflexi n y aprendizaje interesantes preguntas estas respuestas son opiniones personales saludos

5009433 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself
5009434 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
5009435 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due
5009436 can you create a market for cricket in places like the usa and china by playing at the olympics or do you first try to make the citizens of those countries more aware of the game so there is then a demand for it at olympic level

5009457 altro gesto gravissimo e un attacco frontale alla sicurezza e ai delegati che svolgono con incisivit il loro ruolo finalizzato a cucire la bocca a tutti su una questione di interesse generale quale la sicurezza dei viaggiatori
5009458 a fronte del silenzio mantenuto per giorni dalle fs su quellepisodio le preoccupazioni espresse da de angelis prosegue sono da considerare innanzitutto come ladempimento di un dovere nei confronti dei lavoratori e degli utenti del treno questo licenziamento rappresenta inoltre anche una sfida al sindacato che segue di pochi giorni lingiusto licenziamento degli otto operai delle officine di genova
5009459 non e stato motivato per aver diffuso notizie sullepisodio verificatosi il 14 luglio 2008 peraltro ampiamente noto
5009460 reso dichiarazioni contrarie alla verita infondate e pretestuose sia sulle cause che sugli effetti dellepisodio stesso
5009461 creato un grave danno allazienda gettando discredito e generando nella clientela una percezione negativa proprio nel periodo feriale quando il traffico passeggeri registra le punte piu elevate dellintero anno
5009462 il reintegro immediato del macchinista e rappresentante dei lavoratori per la sicurezza rls de angelis che ha solo ricordato che lo spezzamento degli eurostar a milano il 14 e il 22 luglio scorsi sono stati incidenti molto pericolosi e un campanello dallarme che pone con forza all attenzione di tutti la questione della manutenzione della progettazione e dei controlli sugli etr
5009463 non si scherza mai scrive sergio soave nelleditoriale di avvenire n per invitare a non pagarle per protesta n per spargere preoccupazioni per il futuro tra cittadini che gi ne hanno abbastanza e questa aurea regola non scritta vale anche per un ferragosto padano
5009464 se c un tema sul quale i cittadini hanno diritto alla chiarezza e alla coerenza da parte dei governanti questo quello delle tasse quel che proprio non si pu mai fare spiega creare un clima di incertezza far pensare che il regime fiscale dipenda dal ghiribizzo momentaneo di questo o quel ministro e che neppure un impegno programmatico solennemente assunto e immediatamente onorato da una maggioranza stabile sia davvero credibile
5009465 in un ferragosto ovviamente orfano non certo inconsolabile di notizie politiche si pu sempre contare su qualche esibizione pirotecnica del leader della lega nord
5009466 ministro delle riforme il che dovrebbe suggerirgli un po pi di sobriet ma questa lirruenza verbale delluomo nota una speranza destinata ad andare delusa

5009468 con car cter de urgente para que defina sobre el adelantamiento de 50 al b sico comprometido por el gobierno provincial para noviembre
5009469 lo requerido se fundamenta en la disconformidad de la docencia y de ste sindicato acerca de plazo fijado para completar el 20 de recomposici n salarial
5009470 queda manifiesta la discriminaci n a este sector que cobrar a la segunda parte de la reci n en diciembre sobre el cierre del a o lectivo
5009471 lo m nimo esperado es la equiparaci n de los aumentos a los docentes con los logrados por los dem s trabajadores de la administraci n p blica sin perder de vista que los niveles salariales a la vez son superiores
5009472 esperaremos un tiempo razonable la respuesta favorable a este reclamo caso contrario este sindicato estar a disponiendo medidas de acci n directa de acuerdo con lo resuelto por sus rganos de direcci n
5009473 bate record de recaudaci n en una provincia que anuncia peri dicamente mejoras la recaudaci n todos los meses donde nos insisten machaconamente con la idea de la distribuci n de la riqueza
5009474 violando el principio fundamental de igualdad frente a una situaci n de competencia
5009475 la ministra no puede desconocer que la discusi n de este tema fue suspendida intempestiva y desconsideradamente d as anteriores sin haber convocado aun a la comisi n de pol tica salarial para discutir un tema de semejante importancia
5009476 sin reglas claras no es posible sostener una producci n ganadera
5009477 no podemos en la provincia hablar de un plan ganadero si no tenemos cierta certeza de cuales ser n sus resultados un plan ganadero para que para producir a p rdidas con costos superiores a los de la venta para venderle a qui n c mo cu ndo para exportar c mo si luego la naci n lo proh be
5009478 son preguntas que nos hacemos porque nuestra producci n siempre fue mayor a lo que se consume en el pa s el pa s siempre estuvo bien abastecido el resto aproximadamente un 20 se debe exportar porque la hacienda no es un paquete de bulones que se puede almacenar en una estanter a se debe consumir dentro del pa s o venderlo afuera en un plazo de tiempo determinado
5009479 ahora bien con las trabas burocr ticas impuestas seg n el humor de un solo funcionario generalmente de manera arbitraria y discrecional es imposible trazar un plan
5009480 si no hay reglas claras previsibles y como m nimo estables durante cinco a os no es posible sustentar la producci n en forma rentable
5009481 de seguir as el pueblo argentino deber consumir menos carne o si los hace a los niveles actuales se la deber importar porque con la pol tica actual se esta destruyendo a la ganader a de cr a que es el primer eslab n de la cadena de carnes
5009482 reclamamos reglas claras previsibles y durables de otra forma para qu queremos un plan plante
5009483 en esta demora el que paga el pato es el productor
5009484 el gobierno nacional arm todo esto para que se exporte lo menos posible para que el mercado interno se sature de carne y se mantengan bajos los precios de la hacienda nos quieren sacar de los mercados del mundo y esto se ve con el cumplimiento de la cuota hilton y dando una explicaci n a la poblaci n que era para tener carne barata todo lo contrario nunca se lleg a esto
5009485 actualmente las lluvias que ocurren en las cuencas superiores han acortado estos tiempos de concentraci n a un par de d as dejando a los campos sin humedad y agua superficial y bajando las napas liquidando pasturas naturales desertificando y estropeando los mejores campos ganaderos del chaco
5009486 esto debe ser revisado revertido y mejorado con obras complementarias que mitiguen el da o causado hay que manejar el agua no tirarla tambi n deber an construirse grandes reservorios de las lluvias para proveer de agua potable a las poblaciones del interior
5009487 solicitamos al gobierno que ninguna explotaci n agropecuaria viva sin energ a de la red
5009488 ser a una forma clara de bajar los costos del transporte de los frutos del trabajo de los productores chaque os y generar mas puestos de trabajo al servicio del desarrollo provincial
5009489 las intenciones de modificar la ley para que las maquinarias de los consorcios adem s de atender los caminos tambi n se ocupen de realizar trabajos de arada dentro de los campos privados
5009490 nos parece una medida equivocada porque los productores que dirigen los consorcios ad hon rem no deben ocuparse de los campos de particulares ni anarquizar el uso de sus equipos en suma deben ocuparse exclusivamente de las tareas para las cuales fueron creados
5009491 dar respuestas a todos los planteos es muy dif cil pero hemos venido a hacer lo que la conferencia episcopal nos aconsej no utilizar m todos virulentos nosotros hacemos cr ticas a nuestros funcionarios provinciales y nacionales y reconocemos que vivimos en una provincia llena de necesidades el fisco siempre debe tener la parte humana para contemplar las necesidades que tienen que ser interpretadas

5009499 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives

5009503 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5009504 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5009505 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the would rally around it
5009506 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5009507 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice
5009508 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5009510 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5009511 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5009512 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5009513 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5009517 one of the conditions of the coastal commission involves the subterranean parking garage where well have to dig out several thousand tons of dirt
5009518 the commission didnt want any of that dirt to end up in the creek so they said we have to wait until spring after the rains are over to start that
5009519 that will give us time to get everything sorted out and be ready to go
5009520 i think i have a better project today than i had before
5009521 the coastal commission staff in santa cruz did a fantastic job it was a very good experience dealing with the coastal commission i enjoyed it

5009524 the test for determining the scope of this provision must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain
5009525 the focus and aim of our campaign remains to keep all of our post offices open
5009526 work has started on a strong analysis of the impact that each closure would have on the local community
5009527 throughout the consultation period we will continue to campaign vociferously and i would urge everyone to sign the councils petition to save our post offices
5009528 these are the very people who stand to lose out most if their local post office closes

5009583 dreaming teaches us about a fascinating relationship between emotion and motion between our feelings and movement
5009584 whether or not we choose to express emotions through some form of motion we commonly say that we are moved by something that we feel strongly about
5009585 when the flow of emotional energy from the brain to our muscles is inhibited by sleep paralysis our emotions cannot be expressed and discharged into the waking world depending on the intensity of the dream we may experience a powerful backwash of emotional energies reverbertating within us untempered by expression raw and shadowy

5009591 what matters is not the meaning of life in general but the specific meaning of a persons life at a given moment everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment

5009643 the phenomenon of thousands of people moving together in huge blocks like a machine operated by one person to serve one purpose is a phenomenon that history has proven to be associated with regimes we would rather forget ever existed

5009648 la direction du tournoi a confirm elle m me aux responsables de l quipe belge en lui pr sentant ses excuses que le deuxi me goal belge annul tait bien valable et que le goal cor en du 1 1 tait entach dune grosse faute de pied comme ont dailleurs pu le voir et revoir des centaines de milliers de t l spectateurs les efforts de toute une ann e de travail de toute une quipe qui tait en mesure datteindre ses objectifs sportifs sont ainsi r duits n ant par les incomp tences graves au niveau de cet arbitrage indigne dun tournoi olympique
5009649 mettent maintenant tout en oeuvre pour leur prochain match contre la chine afin de pouvoir ambitionner ensuite la 9e place du tournoi
5009650 cest vraiment dommage parce que nous avons l quipe et les qualit s pour faire partie du top 8
5009651 pour la 2e phase larbitre de terrain doit avoir le courage de revenir sur sa d cision tout le stade a pu voir le kick sur le grand cran mais il est rest sur sa d cision
5009652 on travaille 12 mois pour un tournoi et lorsque lon atteint pas son objectif le top 8 cest frustrant surtout lorsque cela se passe de cette mani re le niveau de larbitrage dans ce tournoi est en g n ral tr s bon et les arbitres font leur travail du mieux quils peuvent mais aujourdhui cela a jou en notre d savantage
5009653 la premi re phase ndlr o le goal sur tip in de truyens na pas t valid tait difficile juger pour larbitre indien mais le plus frustrant cest quil existe un mat riel tr s performant pour r aliser des s quences vid o mais que cela nest pas bien utilis sur le ralenti limage est tellement mauvaise quil est quasi impossible de voir sil a touch la balle ou non pour la 2e phase ndlr o la cor e inscrit un goal entach dun pied dans la phase amenant le centre larbitre de terrain doit avoir le courage de revenir sur sa d cision tout le stade a pu voir le kick sur le grand cran mais il est rest sur sa d cision
5009654 apr s cette deuxi me phase nous avons perdu le contr le du match pendant quelques minutes et cest alors que nous nous sommes mis perdre le match mais je suis fier de la mani re dont mes joueurs se sont repris nous nous sommes cr es encore beaucoup doccasions mais navons pas su les transformer tant en d fense quen attaque nous navons pas eu beaucoup de chance aujourdhui mais le foss entre les meilleures quipes de la plan te est d sormais plus petit cest donc encourageant pour lavenir du hockey belge videmment ces consid rations semblent bien loign es pour mon quipe actuellement
5009655 cest vraiment dommage parce que nous avons l quipe et les qualit s pour faire partie du top 8 c tait lobjectif mais d sormais cest devenu impossible nous avons t mis en difficult cause de deux d cisions arbitrales il ne la videmment pas fait volontairement mais cela reste tr s dommageable pour nous nous avons domin la majeure partie de la rencontre et avons mis norm ment de pression dans le jeu nous nous sommes cr s beaucoup doccasions mais navons malheureusement pas su les concr tiser

5009663 there is no question from now on when people think of the greatest swimmer of all time its only going to be michael phelps name that comes to their lips
5009664 he won eight gold medals he deserves to be remembered as the hero of the beijing olympics
5009665 that will be when you win everything and overwhelm the position that will be a phelpsian achievement
5009666 this is all a dream come true you know to really just imagination anything and works towards it
5009667 to accomplish everything youve really ever dreamed of its fun
5009668 its phenomenal and i think in my opinion well never ever see it again i just dont think that can be emulated or beaten
5009669 what im looking forward to is not doing anything just sitting and not moving
5009670 i expect that theres a lot of kids around the country if not around the world who will next week make a pilgrimage to the local swimming pool and ask if theres a signup sheet for the swim team because theres going be a lot of people who want to be just like michael phelps
5009671 values come into all areas of thinking and behavior values are what we consider important but we may not be consciously aware of them
5009672 in a way a perception is an unconscious decision about how we see the world around us because it is unconscious we have no control over our perception unless we make the driving values visible
5009673 some people make the mistake of believing that we see things objectively and then we apply our values unfortunately it is not like that values determine our perception whether or not we are conscious of those values and then what we see tend to support that perception
5009674 want to find out what bloggers who write in a language you cant read are saying this is a great place to start
5009675 but we assume nobody will press the issue with blount county to seek further clarification and they will do whatever they want to do as usual
5009676 since the story broke of potential recount challenges by both candidate barnes and rep davis a couple of things have happened
5009677 what is funny is that in 1984 the soviet union was on the brink of collapse they were a paper tiger not a bear in the woods so in that regard hobbs comparison is fairly accurate
5009678 oh and just to pour salt in the wounds of tirrc crafton is proposing an interpreter fee for those who need language services but remember his wife is japanese and his brother in law is hispanic so its ok
5009679 t he prospect of shorter lines in minority areas and easier access to vote is keeping some gop officials up late at night

5009681 these knuckle draggers who claim they are defenders of judeo christian values clearly dont understand the concept
5009682 the tennessean wants the story to be about numbers but rezoning is a story about people
5009683 pelosi is more than willing to substitute meaningless gimmicks for substantive policy all based on her phobia of being called names by republicans
5009684 in a 2008 america one clearly has to be a christian to be elected and thats wrong
5009685 this reminds me that back in april when gas prices started climbing into the stratosphere local conservative yakker steve gill said it was the democrats fault well bless his heart so now that gas prices are falling do democrats get the credit
5009686 oh my aching head if we werent stuck inside the borders of a giant insane asylum cnn would be laughed off the air

5009691 health plans should not be allowed to apply unfair treatment limitations or financial requirements on mental health benefits
5009692 we want to move the oregon state hospital out of its past
5009693 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
5009694 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
5009695 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
5009696 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
5009697 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
5009698 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
5009699 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
5009700 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
5009701 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
5009702 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
5009703 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
5009704 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
5009705 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
5009706 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
5009707 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
5009708 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
5009709 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
5009710 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve
5009711 ill put my foot so far up your ass the sweat on my knee will quench your thirst
5009712 my mother was a poor single mother and i grew up without a daddy
5009713 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5009714 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5009715 i wonder if we could stay in touch maybe its too much to ask for
5009716 its lovely to get your message could not help go see your pictures yet again my question is why
5009717 well listen to me its sound you are like the pessengers of the wrecked ship were hopeless man must adjust himself to conditions around him in order that he could survive
5009718 mia madre mi ha chiesto di comprare 250g di chia
5009719 im calling about the 4wd atv you have for sale
5009720 i got your number from the bulletin board at the farm store downtown
5009721 there has been some mistake i had a card on that board but it wasnt about an atv for sale ive never owned an atv and never will
5009722 as we wrap up another adventure filled year and turn our attentions to all those year end activities and festivities that can be so all encompassing in many ways i think its also important to once again take a moment to remind ourselves that we should be very grateful that we have all been exceedingly fortunate to be a part of a
5009723 this is not the end it is not even the beginning of the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning
5009724 my client will have to board a flight to london his ticket has been bought by the authorities here after he lands in london hes free to go wherever he wants
5009725 she went into a dead faint and just fell right to the floor
5009726 she was being dragged as she wasnt walking under her own speed
5009727 it looked as if they wanted to get her up to her hotel room as soon as possible
5009728 with these celebrities exhaustion sometimes means something else and a little rest at a spa sometimes actually translates into something a little more serious
5009729 its just been heartbreaking for her parents to watch britney on this downward spiral
5009730 letters from the past hearts scattered on the floor what do you mean whos gonna pick this up letters flowers and smiles who was the real friend the one who said the things you needed but not wanted to hear u still stubborn til the end my mistake to tell u of the future it was too much to know too soon to understand u burned the words written i should have never sent you bigger matches but when the music came it was magical as you still are not enough stars in the sky to rate this guy

5009738 waarin hij zegt dat mensen met een theologische inslag vaak chronisch onbekwaam zijn om onderscheid te maken tussen wat waar is en wat ze graag als waar zouden zien p 122 prikkelde mij bovenmate om kennis te nemen van zijn inzichten
5009739 dietrich bonhoeffers theology in todays world a way between fundamentalism and secularism
5009740 heeft sinds het begin van het menselijk bewustzijn de religie zich gehandhaafd omdat het zoveel van het mens zijn bevat scheiding en samenvoeging haat en liefde boosheid en medelijden nauwkeurige wetten en eenvoudige vroomheid maar ook onzekerheid en zekerheid
5009741 wetenschap zonder religie is kreupel religie zonder wetenschap is blind
5009742 monnik worden was de gemakkelijkste manier voor mendel om zich op zijn
5009743 een van de redenen dat ik weinig op heb met het werk van richard dawkins is dat hij niet laat blijken ooit ook maar een minuut tijd te hebben besteed aan het bestuderen van filosofie of theologie
5009744 volgens jou bestaat er in wezen geen verschil tussen een terrorist van al qaida en je buurman in noord oxford die twee maal per jaar naar de kerk gaat geloof als zodanig vormt het
5009745 niets wat bestaat kan dat zijn wat we met god hebben bedoeld een bestaande god zou een afgod of demon zijn
5009746 kan de drijfveer van mensen om met verkeerde opvattingen over god af te rekenen hen nader tot god brengen
5009747 god ontmantelen en de volmaakte eenheid met god bereiken komt op precies hetzelfde neer
5009748 bespreekt dawkins de god hypothese waarin hij de god van het oude testament zon beetje het onaangenaamste personage noemt
5009749 ten opzichte van de wrede bruut van het oude testament
5009750 de god hypothese een wetenschappelije veronderstelling over het universum is die met evenveel scepsis moet worden onderzocht als elke hypothese
5009751 athe st zijn iets is om trots op te zijn omdat het vrijwel altijd duidt op een gezond zelfdenkend vermogen
5009752 vrije geesten weinig aanmoediging nodig hebben om zich te ontworstelen aan de verdorvenheid van religie
5009753 de darwinistische evolutie neemt het stokje monter over zodra het leven er eenmaal is maar hoe gaat het van start dat vereist de expertise van een chemicus de alternatief ervoor is statistisch van aard met een bespottelijk geringe kans van n op n miljard planeten zal er op aarde leven ontstaan
5009754 een god die in staat is om de ideale waarden te berekenen van de zes natuurconstanten zou minstens even onwaarschijnlijk moeten zijn als de subtiel afgestelde getallencombinatie zelf en dat is wel h l onwaarschijnlijk en de premisse van de hele discussie die we hier voeren
5009755 van het aantal mensen dat het probleem niet inziet en echt genoegen lijkt te nemen met het argument van de goddelijke knoppendraaier een verbijsterende blinde vlek
5009756 voor dawkins telt slechts als werkelijkheid datgene wat via onze instrumenten hersenen microscopen enz materieel kan worden waargenomen
5009757 ik ben terughoudend om een geschiedenis van wetenschappelijke ontdekkingen te beschrijven omdat daaruit het idee zou kunnen ontstaan dat we op een bepaald punt in onze ontwikkeling
5009758 wat ook het leven gebracht mag hebben het bracht het in n keer
5009759 wat is nu de relevantie van dit beroemde incident in de wetenschapsgeschiedenis voor onze reflecties over dawkins houding tegenover de wetenschap het laat ons zien
5009760 wat bedachtzame theologen zoals bonhoeffer zorgen baart is dat de gaten
5009761 religieuze mensen spreken over god zodra hun menselijke kennis hen in de steek laat vaak ten gevolge van denkluiheid of zodra menselijke krachten te kort schieten
5009762 laat me beginnen met een kort commentaar op het bronnenmateriaal dat je verzameld hebt voor een werk dat zich bezighoudt met natuurwetenschappen filosofie psychologie religie spiritualiteit antropologie sociologie geschiedenis en theologie
5009763 de vraag waarom er iets is en niet niets is geen ultieme vraag naar bewijsmateriaal maar deel van een zoektocht naar betekenis en zin die begonnen is met een moment van verwondering over het feit dat er berhaupt iets bestaat
5009764 stel dat u in het theater een uitvoering van hamlet meemaakt en de man naast u levert doorlopend commentaar
5009765 in tegenstelling tot echte artsen placebos mogen toedienen al noemen ze het anders
5009766 zoals materie zich hoort te gedragen zoals wij in onze evolutie zijn gaan denken
5009767 je opsomming klinkt als een klok hoewel sommige voorbeelden heel goed het gevolg kunnen zijn geweest van spanningen van niet godsdienstige aard maar er ontbreken twee catastrofale aspecten van de recente geschiedenis de sovjet unie onder stalin en het duitsland van hitler
5009768 dan wijs ik een weg een stevige dosis wetenschap een eerlijk en systematisch streven om de waarheid over de echte wereld te ontdekken
5009769 volkomen bevredigende naturalistische verklaring voor het bestaan van het universum en van alles wat zich erin bevindt onszelf inbegrepen
5009770 zoals darwin de ontwikkeling van de organische natuur heeft ontdekt zo heeft marx de wet van de menselijke geschiedenis ontdekt
5009771 het heelal is ongeveer veertien miljard jaar geleden uit het niets ontstaan hoewel dit buitengewoon onwaarschijnlijk is zijn de eigenschappen van het heelal precies op het leven afgestemd hoewel het precieze mechanisme van het ontstaan van leven op aarde nog onbekend is heeft het proces van evolutie en natuurlijke selectie toen het leven eenmaal ontstaan was de ontwikkeling van biologische verscheidenheid en complexiteit over een zeer lang tijdsverloop mogelijk gemaakt toen de evolutie eenmaal op gang was gekomen was er geen bijzondere bovennatuurlijke tussenkomst nodig mensen maken deel uit van dit proces en hebben met de grote mensapen een gemeenschappelijke voorouder gemeen maar mensen zijn ook uniek op een manier waarvoor geen evolutionaire verklaring bestaat en die wijst op onze spirituele natuur deze omvat de erkenning van een morele wet de kennis van goed en kwaad en het zoeken naar god dat alle menselijke culturen in de hele geschiedenis kenmerkt
5009772 biologos probeert niet god naar binnen te smokkelen in de lacunes van ons inzicht in de natuurlijke wereld dit tegen het verwijt van de athe stische wetenschapper voor wie biologos de zoveelste
5009773 blind vertrouwen in de afwezigheid van bewijs en zelfs in weerwil van bewijs
5009774 we kunnen zelfs manieren overdenken om welbewust zuiver belangeloos altru sme te cultiveren iets wat in de natuur geen plaats heeft iets wat in de hele geschiedenis van de wereld nog nooit is voorgekomen
5009775 hier stuiten we op een paradox dawkins is kennelijk een aanhanger van de morele wet waarover collins in hoofdstuk 1 van zijn boek uitgebreid spreekt hb
5009776 de voornaamste en onvermijdelijke fout in dawkins stelling dat de wetenschap athe sme vereist is dat deze stelling het bewijsmateriaal overstijgt
5009777 huxley heeft er terecht op gewezen dat er op basis van de beschikbare gegevens geen uitspraak over deze kwestie de vraag naar het bestaan van god hb
5009778 het geloof in god vraagt eenvoudig niet om het opgeven van rationaliteit of het is dan ook de overtuiging van collins dat wetenschap en geloof elkaar diensten kunnen bewijzen en in de visie op de werkelijkheid elkaar kunnen aanvullen
5009779 hoe we van helemaal niets zijn tot iets zijn gekomen en hoe vervolgens een kleine hoeveelheid van dat iets in ons veranderde
5009780 een boek dat een geweldig succes werd in groot britanni
5009781 hoe kunnen ze weten hoe en wanneer het heelal begon en hoe het was toen het begon hoe weten ze eigenlijk wat er zich in een atoom afspeelt en dan nog de vraag misschien wel bovenal hoe kan het dat wetenschappers vaak van alles lijken te weten maar nog steeds geen aardbeving kunnen voorspellen of ons zelfs maar vertellen of we een paraplu moeten meenemen naar de races van volgende week woensdag
5009782 opgetogen wetenschappers hebben verschillende keren laten weten dat ze genen hadden gevonden die verantwoordelijk waren voor zwaarlijvigheid schizofrenie homoseksualiteit criminaliteit gewelddadigheid alcoholisme en niet te vergeten kleptomanie en zwerflust
5009783 al die kleine en kundige chemische processen die cellen tot leven brengen de co peratieve inspanningen van nucleotiden de omzetting van dna in rna zijn in
5009784 wat kan worden gezegd van colibacil e moet ook voor olifanten gelden zij het in een omvangrijker mate
5009785 denken en handelen met het oog op de komende generatie en bereid zijn om verder te gaan zonder angst en zorgen dat is de richting die ons door de praktijk wordt opgedrongen dit moedig vol te houden is niet eenvoudig maar noodzakelijk
5009786 denken en handelen met het oog op de komende generatie
5009787 uiteindelijk is de belangrijkste vraag voor de toekomst hoe wij een basis vinden voor het samen leven van mensen welke geestelijke werkelijkheden en wetten wij nemen als fundament van een zinvol menselijk leven
5009788 hoe zullen we een basis vinden voor het samen leven met andere mensen
5009789 de geestelijke werkelijkheden en wetten die voor ons fundament zijn van een zinvol menselijk leven naar deze
5009790 de kerk in de open sfeer van een intellectuele discussie
5009791 heb ik ontleend aan een uitspraak van een jonge vrouw die ik onlangs op tv zag en die vertelde over een zieke vriendin die van alles al had meegemaakt op medisch paranormaal en religieus gebied en uiteindelijk tot de conclusie was gekomen dat god haar in dit alles had geholpen
5009792 geloven in een god die niet bestaat manifest van een athe stische

5009797 a horrible tragedy happened the environmental protection agency is calling it one of the worst enviromental disasters in u s history criminal acts that were unspeakable and unforgivable the media lit up with the news story for a short time but then the publisity died down and faded just as the small town of libby did now this catastrophe is all but forgotten but i wont forget or let go because i am from libby montana i will document to the best of my abilities the story of the victims from a small town poisoned by asbestos it will be a journal of feelings and fears facts stories and information on a small town in the mountains sixty miles south of the canadian boarder libby montana is my home town it is a place of fond memories and harsh lessons libby is nested in a valley surrounded by thick pine and towering mountains it is a community of simple people with big hearts and battered lungs the mine on zonolite mountain extracted vermiculite used in insulation the vermiculite was laced with asbestos the zonolite mine started operations in 1924 the very same year a study by the british medical journal sited asbestos as a cause of death the company knew in 1963 that tremolite asbestos was a contaminant in 1969 workers from the mine were x rayed with horrifying results the miners were never told of the findings tests that very same year showed that twenty four thousand pounds of dust a day were expelled from the large stack on the dry mill the dust was twenty percent asbestos this not only harmed the miners but affected the entire valley and nothing was done about it the company withheld this information for the sake of profit w r grace the owner of the operation built a new mill in 1975 this doubled the mills production half a million pounds of asbestos a day were produced libbys miners and families have filed one hundred and seven civil actions against w r grace since 1984 the mine finally closed in 1990 with the environmental protection agency left to clean up the mess and witness first hand a beautifully wooded valley populated by the dying

5009810 nada m s f cil que desenmascarar a los cineastas insinceros a quienes tras una apariencia brillante de profundidad s lo buscan deslumbrar o impresionar al espectador sin reparar en los medios no basta mostrar una fila de hombres y mujeres desnudos haciendo cola ante la entrada de una c mara de gas para lograr una denuncia v lida contra el nazismo como han cre do los autores de kapo

5009813 we are also looking at attraction development as attractions are very key alternative energy information and communication technology agriculture and agri business
5009814 we have set up in a very trendy section of beijing a jamaica business club housed in a major bar restaurant featuring live music here we showcase a number of the products that we have brought here including picka pepper sauce and rum we are really focusing on jamaican rum this trip because we have a unique opportunity in beijing to introduce rum on a wide scale as a premium spirit
5009815 that went down really well with the athletes and really set the tone in terms of them knowing that we are here for them
5009816 our main objective here in terms of our exports is to focus on high end high value low volume because the scale of the chinese market is so massive its too large to even contemplate trying to fill that demand we are also looking at distributors in china who have experience with western food specifically the expatriate segment of the market which also include high end chinese who are seeking to buy wholesale food
5009817 we will basically be giving them a first hand look at some of the investment potential that we have and also present them with opportunities to invest in some of our products
5009818 the scores the placements they dont matter to me anymore
5009819 im having the greatest time of my life i just want to go out there and have fun and just show the world i can be the best i can no matter what
5009820 i am more than happy wearing another silver i mean a three time olympic medalist
5009821 the great general of north korea and the people of north korea were waiting and i was very happy to send this very happy news to them
5009822 as i never tire of saying heat is not the antithesis of light but rather the source of it
5009823 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics because faith is just a world view and everybody has some sort of world view
5009824 any leader needs someone who can get into your face and say boy you really screwed that one up
5009825 table where a lot of different points of view are represented
5009826 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him
5009827 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies thats my commitment thats my commitment to you
5009828 i really dont think religious minorities be they jewish muslim orthodox hindu sikh or others would have much chance under the system of a judicial appointments committee because they would be turned down on most occasions on the grounds they are not the most meritorious appointment
5009829 it would be argued there is always a good old boy more deserving the only way broader consideration would come into judicial appointments is because the government appoints them otherwise it would be a closedshop
5009830 the consciousness of the need to have women properly represented on the judiciary i think those views have developed about as quickly in government as they have on the bench
5009831 i think the views of government are mirrored in the views of the judiciary
5009832 i dont think it an independent board would have made any difference quite frankly
5009833 liaise with the entire ministry discuss specific issues with ministers in smaller settings and hear an address from the prime minister
5009834 specific working roundtable meetings with parliamentary secretaries and alp members of house and senate committees
5009835 canberra policy days periodically ministers will host policy days in canberra to encourage a multi layered approach for addressing major subjects in their portfolios
5009836 working group meetings the forum will host working group meetings with government ministers the latter in bold
5009837 will discuss detailed policy issues in a small setting and are designed for companies with interests in specific areas
5009838 the rudd labor government has been preaching about how virtuous they are in relation to political donations and fund raising while rejecting the coalitions repeated calls for a more holistic and longer term approach to reform
5009839 and now we discover kevin 08 is selling democracy for 50 000 a head this is more evidence that there is a lack of public confidence in the current rules regarding political donations and that can only be restored by adopting the coalitions idea to have a thorough holistic multi party review of campaign finance laws instead of kevin rudds piecemeal cherry picking approach to changes
5009840 senator ronaldson is also very happy to endorse the national partys business observer program where business leaders are asked to tick the box next to the shadow minister people want to lobby
5009841 when it comes to political fundraising reform senator ronaldsons anti disclosure actions speak much more loudly than his words in the last session of parliament senator ronaldson and the coalition used their numbers in the senate to block concrete fundraising reforms
5009842 senator ronaldson voted against the labor governments law to lower the maximum value of undeclared donations from 10 900 to 1000
5009843 senator ronaldson used his vote to ensure liberal party mates could make secret donations worth almost 11 000 to the liberal party without disclosure
5009844 all the major parties have business membership schemes but also have regular dialogue with business outside of these schemes labor is the only major party that supports scrapping the howard era secret donations regime
5009845 there are a few things that corrupt a democracy one of them is when this stuff goes off the rails
5009846 when it comes to reining in campaign finance i think this has actually gone too far
5009847 i think theyre cba taking a real serious look at it
5009848 i know very well that a particular adviser rang one of my directors on wednesday night and threatened that director that he would be doing all that he could to besmirch the reputation of the commonwealth bank and myself i didnt take too kindly to that and i rang donald workman an rbs executive and made it very clear i was not impressed with the lack of professionalism shown by the particular adviser and asked them to sort it out
5009849 board approval had already been received when that clearly wasnt the case
5009850 there was never any question in rbss mind that now the board may not wish to proceed for whatever reason
5009851 we had a situation where we entered into a non binding arrangement which was subject to board approval
5009852 we had a 25 working day due diligence process to go through wed reached about day five we had a discussion with our board on wednesday on tuesday and came to the conclusion that the transaction was not compelling enough to go any further
5009853 they do have quite a sizeable asset book that we would have to fund at the same time their capital requirements have largely been satisfied by their parents theres a significant capital injection that would have to be made in order to appropriately capitalise the entity
5009854 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
5009855 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
5009856 shall be commander in chief of the defence forces of zimbabwe
5009857 this whole process is about sharing power mr mugabe will be head of state and mr tsvangirai will be head of government with executive power
5009858 there are hundreds of thousands of people waiting for help and we dont have the wherewithal to deal with the situation
5009859 we will establish the writ of the government at all costs as a parallel government cannot be tolerated
5009860 he realised that he had no choice dangerous or not he had to do it
5009861 if you always look over your shoulder how can you remain a human being
5009862 the values of humanity that rogge had predicted and he respectfully submits that since he depus own prison is a mere 10km away from the olympic hurly burly rogge could easily enough test these claims if he wished
5009863 from tomorrow russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers mr medvedev told french president nicolas sarkozy in a telephone conversation the kremlin said
5009864 there is a ceasefire and russia is currently not in compliance with this ceasefire said dr rice
5009865 have just this morning announced that their troops will begin to withdraw and withdraw fully and completely back to the lines prior to this conflict tomorrow on monday
5009866 this is the promise that the russian president has given to the french president i hope this time hell keep his word
5009867 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters she told nbcs meet the press in a separate live interview
5009868 very fast russian withdrawal and extended one of the strongest statements yet of support for georgias nato membership bid which is fiercely opposed by russia
5009869 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to she said before talks with president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi
5009870 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in major general vyacheslav borisov said
5009871 this is just a redeployment they have pulled out from their bases but they are still all over the place you can see that national security council secretary alexander lomaia said in gori
5009872 we are here to protect the people and stop looting he said
5009873 all the roads are free for humanitarian aid and georgians he said
5009874 there is no room for debate on this matter the president said at his texas ranch
5009875 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
5009876 the speed and weight of money behind this move has been quite breathtaking
5009877 commodity booms end ugly they always do and there has never been an exception
5009878 this down swing is more consistent with the global economic fundamentals
5009879 the commodity markets are more central to australian national income than either credit markets or share markets
5009880 prices for our commodity exports are still at generational highs and ongoing demand from emerging economies give us some cause for optimism despite slowing global growth
5009881 what we are witnessing in the crude oil market is the bursting of a fairly typical speculative bubble
5009882 with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force
5009883 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
5009884 historically russia has been and will continue to be a guarantor of security for peoples of the caucasus
5009885 brendon got a great start and did a really good job throughout the race as i could see he was struggling quite a lot
5009886 i got really close a few times but there wasnt really the opportunity to make the move towards the end of the race brendon made a small mistake at copse and i was able to get side by side and then just squeezed through as we went into turn two its great to get this win
5009887 isolated inulin polydextrose and maltodextrin are soluble fibers but theyre not gummy so they probably dont lower blood cholesterol or blood sugar
5009888 isolated oat fiber and soy fiber are insoluble so they may help keep you regular polydextrose may also help but inulin and maltodextrin dont seem to
5009889 the evidence that high fiber foods lower the risk of colon cancers is inconclusive
5009890 disse a ele que a vida continua embora o mundo dele tenha ca do
5009891 ele parece ter calculado mal o movimento e aberto um pouco as pernas antes de aterrissar
5009892 has our increasingly paranoid society declared war on the humble weekend snapper
5009893 can you spot willy the polar bear please view large size just a little fun
5009894 assisted the government investigators in understanding construction practices which significantly aided the prosecutors in drafting of subpoenas other requests for documents and materials and charges
5009895 the 55 million question remains in regard to just whom are mssrs carothers moultrie cawood and morehead cooperating with federal prosecutors are their sic other indictments forthcoming
5009896 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
5009897 those ads are funny not only funny but very novel and creative
5009898 weve decided were running for u s senate why not were just as qualified as al franken and were better bowlers
5009899 after reading your article this morning i wished i felt more compassionate but was instead frustrated and dumbfounded by the debt that family took on which was well beyond their means
5009900 the size of the mortgage 190 000 was astronomical relative to their income
5009901 borrowers need to be realistic about their earning ability and be conservative in their estimation of what they can afford a skill which seems to be sorely missing in this mortgage debacle
5009902 we have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence
5009903 people who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made
5009904 americas own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens
5009905 die w hlerbasis der cdu scheint solche sachen nicht gewohnt zu sein
5009906 die schwarze basis hinkt dem noch hinterher ihre anpassungsf higkeit ist nicht so ausgepr gt wie bei den gr nen die schon von ihrer geschichte her gr ere schwenks gemacht haben
5009907 aber ich w rde es nicht so dramatisch einsch tzen weil sich die w hlerbasis und auch die partei gewandelt haben
5009908 aber es wird nicht so dramatisch werden wie in vorangegangenen zeiten
5009909 ich habe gewusst dass ich in der lage bin der mannschaft zu helfen und ich habe immer gesagt dass auch ich spiele f r den hsv entscheiden kann
5009910 ganz ehrlich das nervt es wird zeit dass man damit aufh rt
5009911 rafael hat viel f r den hsv getan dar ber muss man nicht diskutieren aber er ist schon zwei wochen in madrid und wir haben bewiesen ohne ihn erfolgreich fu ball spielen zu k nnen
5009912 hinterher musste ich schmunzeln denn michael wei ja ganz genau in welche ecke ich normalerweise schie e dahin ist er auch gesprungen aber ich habe vorsichtshalber die andere genommen
5009913 qu fue lo ltimo que bombardearon los terroristas el metro donde a uno le dejan subir con todo el equipaje que quiera
5009914 for israels 60th anniversary we are going to rekindle the spirit energy and pride of those exciting days by holding the largest gathering of the jewish community in more than half a century
5009915 you may wonder why i think it is important to protest this event isnt it just a celebration of culture and tradition and arent such celebrations and rituals important
5009916 i love mpt and i will do anything for them
5009917 i feel as if im gonna keel over any minute and die that is often what it feels like if youre really doing coalition work most of the time you feel threatened to the core and if you dont youre not really doing no coalescing if youre in a coalition and youre comfortable it is not a broad enough coalition
5009918 if violence truly brought about social change by now wed be living in a utopia
5009919 if i cant dance i dont want to be a part of your revolution
5009920 thats exactly why there will be change because all they have is guns
5009921 i mean to resist the hatred of these times any way i can
5009922 in a world built on violence one must be a revolutionary before one can be a pacifist in such a world a non revolutionary pacifist is a contradiction in terms a monstrosity
5009923 unless a religion springs from within the people themselves it is a weapon of the system
5009924 i feel as if im gonna keel over any minute and die that is often what it feels like if youre really doing coalition work most of the time you feel threatened to the core and if you dont youre not really doing no coalescing if youre in a coalition and youre comfortable it is not a broad enough coalition

5009927 jai pens plein de choses durant la course jai eu des haut et des bas depuis quelques ann es et cette demi tait un moment de stress dautant plus que les demi finales taient tr s d s quilibr es il y avait quand m me trois champions du monde et lagat ne passe pas je coince un peu sur la fin car je fais lext rieur pour viter les chutes le plus important cest de passer en finale demain sera un autre jour et on verra comment cela va se passer
5009928 youre the only one who seems to like that lor
5009929 had it for lunch today gotta have it again tonight
5009930 theyd say is no good is no good theyre very particular with what they cook with
5009931 packed to the gills because of a recent feature in a broadsheet
5009932 lori you dont make apple pies all that often exactly because you dont have that thing
5009933 the pie festival came about because of one dish that we had on the menu
5009934 the lamb pie it was practically selling itself so we decided to offer other pies
5009935 hole in the wall places that are great for a friday night gimmick
5009936 who are you and what have you done with my wife
5009937 he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else
5009938 you are better off eating at your friendly street food vendor than in lime88 thanks for the funny review though you are the best lori
5009939 we would as part of our ongoing crackdown on hoon driving consider this
5009940 anything that protects the community from the scourge of hoon drivers the liberal party would support
5009941 the evidentiary value of it may be negligible unless its integrity can be assured
5009942 the government must be up front with residents and tell us if they have an intention to build this road or not
5009943 and as the idea has been raised in several submissions to the eddington report it has been included in our consultations
5009944 every time degeneres and de rossi visit de rossis family in australia their rights protections and status as a married couple will cease to exist
5009945 you would have to shop around for a good price and see what you could get even if it meant 20 or 30 each way we would certainly look at flying with a different airline
5009946 we are reluctantly introducing modest baggage fees due to ever rising costs to all airlines associated with baggage security screening and extreme rises in the cost of jet fuel
5009947 today due to increased security screening which is a necessary fact of life it costs us more to process a bag than its owner
5009948 its a bit hard when you are going somewhere and you dont know how much you want to bring back
5009949 i would probably still come here i would just take in as much hand luggage as possible
5009950 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
5009951 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
5009952 if mr swan thinks fuelwatch will save motorists 10 a tank hes deluding himself and misleading the australian people
5009953 all of the evidence is that fuelwatch will reduce competition and our most price sensitive motorists will end up paying more for their petrol
5009954 if mr swan cant get his sums right on this how can we have any confidence in his management of our 1 trillion economy
5009955 it could well be it does slow down the loading and unloading of trams
5009956 it is not anticipated that the requirement to scan off will slow down trams
5009957 the scanning process is much faster than the current validation process
5009958 as customers leave a tram they will be required to pass their card across the reader at walking pace
5009959 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mt isa
5009960 quite often youll see walking down the street a lass who isnt so attractive with a wide smile
5009961 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5009962 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mt isa where happiness awaits
5009963 its an absolute disgrace its not councils view and its not mine
5009964 they are clinging to some glimmer of hope but are obviously distressed
5009965 where is premier john brumby going to get the extra money and where will the speed cameras go to make up the difference
5009966 but its being riddled with speed cameras from one end to the other
5009967 this is principally due to an expected increase in traffic camera and on the spot fines arising from the planned opening of eastlink
5009968 fred loved his family he loved his son and he loved his fiancee
5009969 we have a number of witnesses and a number of persons assisting us with our inquiries
5009970 by releasing this reward we aim to encourage in particular a specific caller who rang crime stoppers in 1994 and provided specific and detailed information regarding the identity of freds killer how he was killed and the location of where fred was killed
5009971 i urge that caller to call back knowing what we do now this has increased the significance of this callers information from 1994
5009972 in all of these matters there is always somebody that has not told the whole story of what they know
5009973 this caller could hold the key to finally solving this case and providing an answer for the family
5009974 les mots ne sont pas assez forts pour exprimer ce que je ressens
5009975 mec combien de fois par jour vais je voir ta tronche
5009976 avant le 200 m papillon et le 4x200 m nage libre mercredi le dernier texto que jai re u avant de nager disait
5009977 jai tout ce quil faut pour ne jamais oublier mes souvenirs des photos et mes m dailles
5009978 jai toujours dit que je voulais messayer au sprint 50 et 100 m ndlr mais bob bowman son coach ndlr na pas tr s envie que je le fasse
5009979 jai r v de beaucoup de choses dans ma vie et jai mis sur papier beaucoup dobjectifs
5009980 je mange beaucoup de p tes et de pizzas de glucides et je dors autant que possible tous les matins je me r veillais vers 4 h 30 5 heures cest assez dur de se lever mais on est aux
5009981 cest la premi re question laquelle je ne sais pas quoi r pondre
5009982 je ne veux pas que mon sport ne soit reconnu que tous les quatre ans
5009983 nous sommes arriv s au village deux jours avant les jeux
5009984 jai h te de masseoir et de ne plus bouger
5009985 oh mon dieu jai travaill toute ma vie pour ce temps de 10
5009986 you look at someone like sonny bill we dont know the end result and all the details i feel hes a good guy but the people around him probably havent benefited him really well
5009987 hes been manipulated a bit he probably doesnt know it if hed worked a few years he might have been able to make a better decision on his own
5009988 going back to when i first debuted a lot of guys still worked and they lived in reality these kids come at 17 18 theyve never had to really work theyve gone straight into professional sport
5009989 i honestly think their values are a little bit off the mark they dont know any different they havent gone out into the workforce
5009990 a lot of clubs have got player welfare i know the broncos have always tried to do the right thing by players
5009991 i think player managers have got a bit to answer for there
5009992 if the club wants stability and success it wants to have players that want to be part of a good culture
5009993 youve got to have that around you you have to set standards otherwise if you dont have anyone giving the young ones direction it doesnt work
5009994 i was able to achieve a lot in the game and if it wasnt for the broncos i wouldnt have achieved all that
5009995 you look at someone like sonny bill we don amp squo t know the end result and all the details i feel he amp squo s a good guy but the people around him probably haven amp squo t benefited him really well
5009996 georgien wird wenn es das will und das will es ja mitglied der nato sein
5009997 f r mich hat sich die lage an dieser stelle nicht ver ndert
5009998 nicht ewig in der ursachenforschung zu verharren sondern den blick nach vorne zu richten
5009999 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
