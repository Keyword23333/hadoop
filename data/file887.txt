8870029 it is now a valid question for shareholders to ask companies if it is possible to mitigate the tax rate via a change of domicile and what factors may prevent it happening
8870030 the uk continues to offer one of the most competitive business tax regimes of any major economy
8870031 however tax is just one of a range of factors that contribute to our competitiveness among these are the highly skilled workforce world class infrastructure and the internationalism that make us a leading international base for business
8870032 it is best not to swat the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8870033 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8870034 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8870035 to sit and worry about inflation expectations rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8870036 people have to start to respond to the fact that we are in a recession and the danger is well be in a very serious and long lasting recession unless we do something this is a call to action
8870037 certainly has a great deal of wishful thinking attached to it
8870038 i feel that things i have been fearful about have come to pass and i have actually been pretty accurate in whats coming and i have failed to convince the others of what is appropriate
8870039 people need to understand that sometimes you will have to focus on the timing of issues i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on
8870040 the fulham game was not good enough for a club like arsenal we have to be at the top and to be at the top you have to play with the right spirit
8870041 that is what we tried to do against twente and we showed with the players we have got if everyone is playing the same way we can have a great result of course we have to win things and that is the main objective this year
8870042 but if we can do it the way we play it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and that is what we are doing at arsenal we have to win things i hope this year will be a good one and i am sure we can do it
8870043 we have to be focused have a good rest before the game and try to do our best
8870044 when you play in english football you know that any team you play is going to be a tough game fulham showed us last weekend that you have to be up for every game we know that that was a big blow and we learn from this and hopefully it wont happen again
8870045 if we can do it by the end of the deadline we will if not we will focus on the players we already have

8870048 with the standard residential rate currently standing at 9 43 per cent this may prove costly
8870049 if you used one to get over a one off blip and youve got yourself back on track over the last two or three years you should be able to approach the standard mortgage market as long as you have the equity on your house
8870050 however there are people who have used sub prime mortgages to just continually recycle their debt for these people this could be the end of the line and they could be facing repossession
8870051 those who have had difficulties in the past are going to find it even harder now and youre not going to see sub prime rates go back down to the near prime rates of a few years ago
8870052 there is a view that we are close to a ceiling for the paid for download market simply because there are so many ways for consumers to get music for free
8870053 consumers are showing that they want their music for free and record labels are finally starting to ask can we make money from free
8870054 so the labels are looking across at the people who are making money under the free model and that is the device manufacturers such as apple and nokia

8870059 the department of health is not asking the question about absence rates there is a failure of the government to tackle productivity issues in the nhs the government has employed huge numbers of extra managers what are they all doing
8870060 over the past decade the government has turned a blind eye to the problem ministers seem to be operating a dont know dont ask policy
8870061 the nhs has 24 7 shift working and there is a high degree of stress also frontline staff are working with sick people so they are likely to pick up things like flu

8870065 retail conditions have been extremely tough this summer and the wet august has been a further blow sadly no let up is expected as we head into early autumn the business outlook is particularly weak and retailers are having to scale back their employment and investment plans in an attempt to ride out the storm
8870066 it is not going to get any better for 18 months

8870229 i wonder which belt and collared shirt i should wear to work today
8870230 jordan will never be seen in a belt when he dies and you have to carry his dead body around the pants may not stay up depending on the wacky situations we get into dont use a belt you can just staple the pants to him i shall not worry he can not feel it but how can anyone be completely sure there was that one episode of tales from the crypt where that one guy pranked his one friend by drugging him and made him believe that he had died and could still feel pain and see everything just not move but everyone pretended he was dead and they even set him up on a platform and made him believe he was hanging by a hook in his back then they laid him on his back and did the fake autopsy that episode was creepy one of the best jordan ever watched he sure does hope those dvd sets go on sale for the halloween season but the point is that maybe jordan was just drugged by an invulnerable hobo who thought he was gwyneth paltrow on second thought dont staple the pants to him just tape them up real tight

8870260 no doubt the board have done well because we now have companies like globacom lucozade sports and others trying to be part of the league but i want to ask one question
8870261 the npl chairman just announced that every club will get nine thousand cartons of lucozade sports drink this season but what happens if a club wants to go with red bull or power horse
8870262 the npl have already knocked off one category of sponsorship and are forcing the clubs to use it
8870263 i think this anomaly should be looked at because they are killing opportunities for clubs in terms of taking all the juicy offers
8870264 today the npl is still trying to get their television rights but this is what the sponsors are looking for to get to those at home who do not come to the stadium

8870275 rechazamos el imperialismo catal n nacido a trav s del concepto de pa sos catalans
8870276 exige al gobierno de arag n que se celebre una consulta popular en el arag n oriental para dejar que sean los hablantes los que decidan sobre el futuro de su lengua pues no son ni los pol ticos ni los ling istas los que deben decidir e imponer una lengua sino que son los propios hablantes los nicos que tienen el derecho de decidir c mo quieren hablar y cu l es la denominaci n que le dan a su propia lengua
8870277 en caso que la dga no realice dicho refer ndum la plataforma estudia la posibilidad de organizarlo simb licamente dados los apoyos recibidos por muchos vecinos de las comarcas orientales la consulta se realizar a en todas las comarcas con la colaboraci n de diferentes vecinos de la zona que se han ofrecido ya a la plataforma para ayudar en dicho cometido
8870278 finalmente la pnhc ha realizado ya diversas gestiones para que llegado el caso se presente un recurso de inconstitucionalidad y en ltimo extremo acudir a estrasburgo y denunciar la imposici n de una lengua en un territorio europeo en el que sus habitantes conviven secularmente con su lengua materna aragonesa y con la lengua oficial del estado

8870280 un conjunto de personas asociaciones y entidades de diferentes ndoles tanto del arag n oriental como del occidental as como algunas del resto de comunidades aut nomas sensibilizadas ante la propuesta de la inclusi n del catal n en nuestra ley de lenguas de arag n nuestra plataforma tiene como objetivo no parar la ley de lenguas de arag n sino no incluir el t rmino de catal n o lengua catalana para designar a la lengua o lenguas del arag n oriental entendiendo que los ciudadanos de aquellas comarcas son de lengua y cultura aragonesas y que reportan gran parte de nuestra identidad tanto cultural como ling sticamente
8870281 se va a votar una ley de lenguas que nos va a obligar a tomar el catal n como lengua propia la lengua mayoritaria en arag n es el espa ol o castellano en nuestra tierra se hablan y transmiten modalidades propias aragonesas lo suficientemente fundamentadas para fortalecerlas y cuidarlas primero fue la confederaci n catalana aragonesa luego la invenci n de la franja despu s los pa sos catalans posteriormente el expolio de las obras de arte sacro y ahora hay aragoneses que quieren imponer a nuestros hijos el catal n nos negamos completamente

8870347 channels in bacteria perform absolutely key roles in cell survival we have been able to show how this channel opens and closes understanding how they work will play a major role in inhibiting the survival of bacteria and could have applications as basic as cleansing hospital equipment and wards or helping to make food safer these channels are found in mrsa and c difficile and this knowledge has not yet been exploited the future path is to find new chemicals and processes that exploit the importance of the channels to these bacteria
8870348 the system is mechanical the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8870349 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8870350 new chemicals designed to force channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader

8870413 if they can do that then i think well be ok we hope our defense can be good i dont know how good but hopefully they will be good
8870414 i was very impressed with them i thought they played very hard and they never quit
8870415 if they had had a little bit more time left in that game they very easily could have won it
8870416 christiansburg never stopped them and i thought they did a really nice job of mixing up the run and the play action pass theyre a good ball club christiansburg is a heck of a ball club so they didnt lose to any slouch team and at the same time came very close to winning
8870417 we approach every game as tough i respect every opponent we play
8870418 i know all their coaches work hard and they all have good talent and this game is not any different than the rest of them
8870419 theres a lot of pride about football in this whole area and well have to play but thats how we approach all the games i dont think were better than anybody well hopefully go out and play and give it everything weve got
8870420 you always get excited for this game i dont know if you can compare this or that but you still get excited
8870421 we had espn come down and we came back and won late in the game
8870422 it wasnt a lot of fireworks but we ended up winning 6 4 we threw a late touchdown pass and i thought that was pretty good
8870423 we need to score and get a little confidence back
8870424 the kids were pretty upset after fridays game but i think well be all right we think we can move the ball on st paul
8870425 weve got to learn how to tackle you cant try to arm tackle you cant do that and win football games
8870426 phillips is a real good athlete hes a big kid hes hard to tackle and he throws the ball well hell throw it from anywhere on the field if we can contain him and keep him under control well have a chance to win
8870427 this one of those games where we have to be ready to play and were going to have to be on our
8870428 we came to the sidelines and we were all huffing and puffing after about four or five plays
8870429 it is totally different now in the second or third series we all caught our second wind and we were fine but i think with this weight off were not going to see that at the beginning of the season
8870430 thats something coach newsome has said to us since weve started
8870431 he doesnt want to see that look in our eyes when we come off after four plays and be huffing and puffing i think thats not going to be a problem
8870432 when you first get into the start of a season you get into football shape through camp but you get into game shape by actually playing games
8870433 i dont know that we think it is on us but were taking it upon our responsibility that it is on us
8870434 we have four of us returning and weve got guys that have played so we feel that it is time to take it on our shoulders
8870435 i dont even know how far back that goes but ive been here since 03
8870436 i think as an offensive line we need to take it on our shoulders to make sure that were moving this team forward
8870437 when we are on offense we need to control the ball and we need to keep grinding it out were need to be running the ball and moving the chains
8870438 we can be as good as we want to be is what coach newsome always says
8870439 its a matter if we come out here and we work hard every day
8870440 if you take one day off you dont get that day back so each day weve got to keep pushing each other to get better
8870441 we need to carry this team we need to keep everybody moving keep everybody pushing
8870442 if us big guys can do it then theres no excuse for some of the younger guys
8870443 i just feel that us as an offensive line needs to take this on our shoulders and just move this team and move it forward
8870444 we both have a win under our belts gate city is always a challenge and we are much improved im sure all the players are looking forward to this and the fans should be excited
8870445 his teams are always physical always prepared and always expecting to win those are our goals too
8870446 gate city has about 20 starters back so they are very tough we have about the same number and we know both teams are going to get after each other tonight
8870447 the one thing we were fearful of going into this game was adjusting to their game speed theyve got a heck of a football team theyre going to win a lot of games
8870448 we knew very little about our opponent so we wanted to do our basic offense and try to be fundamentally sound and i think we were pretty successful in that plan except one or two things we havent caught a punt yet and we turned the ball over there early bad
8870449 we got a chance to play a lot of kids we really have a lot of respect for coach quick and his program it was a good outing for us were proud of our kids and excited
8870450 were no different a football team than when we came in tonight were embarrassed a little bit but its one game its a journey and we hang together and as a team and a family they held together
8870451 were definitely not happy with the outcome were hurting inside because we didnt walk out of that gate victorious but we will walk through that gate victorious weve got lenoir rhyne next week the mountain lions are going to come out of that cage
8870452 weve got to get ready for week 2 they say you improve a lot from week 1 to week 2 and i hope thats right cause well have our hands full
8870453 weve got to control the line of scrimmage weve got to keep the ball and thats the bottom line
8870454 id love for it to be boring just four yards here and three yards there thats what i would like to see
8870455 i dont think any game carries more significance than another game but its a big game
8870456 as a player we broke that 10 game streak when i was a senior and then i think probably our first two years after coach passed away
8870457 coming from behind and beating them and then beating them the next year so those are big memories
8870458 i know one time they had us down 20 0 and we came back and won 21 20
8870459 theres a lot of memories more memories there than there are anywhere probably i lived in bluefield virginia so its been a part of me ever since i was a kid
8870460 they have so much speed that they can run at us and some awful good skill athletes
8870461 you get speed with the ball and it is a double edged sword for us right now
8870462 we did move the ball well offensively but we still made a lot of mistakes on offense
8870463 weve got to eliminate those mistakes tomorrow night against a good football team if we hope to come out of there with a victory
8870464 weve got to tackle people its a new defense and it was a defense we had gone against in scrimmages and were still tweaking it but in this defense you cant cowboy
8870465 you could kind of cowboy in our old defense a little bit but you cant cowboy this defense you have got to be where youre supposed to be
8870466 i dont know if that will play into our hands or not but that is what were going to do
8870467 were not going to deviate from what we like to do
8870468 we got effort against christiansburg and we never quit we fought the effort was there
8870469 if the effort is there its up to us to get them in the right places
8870470 we know probably a little bit more about where we are with regards to some things that you dont work on in scrimmages like the kicking game
8870471 youve probably got that first game jitters out from under your belt or at least you hope so
8870472 its about town pride its about family pride its about school pride
8870473 its a lot pride its a lot about bragging rights its a lot about being able to walk around town with your chest stuck out for a year so it means a lot
8870474 we went down to gate city and didnt play richlands style football
8870475 we made bad decisions offensively we didnt have leverage off the line we had three turnovers in the first half and overall we didnt have good technique
8870476 we told our kids at halftime that that we needed to come out and win the second half the kids responded and did that and we feel good about that
8870477 they have size at their skilled positions and they have hall who is in his third year as a starter hes over 6 foot tall and over 200 pounds and he can run the ball
8870478 its going to be the same as at gate city they have a lot of their starters back and were going to have our work cut out for us

8870480 becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change
8870481 africans need to formulate what is essential to them to act both to limit emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change
8870482 africa has to know whats to the liking of africa
8870483 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts at reducing theirs
8870484 emissions reductions should not be used as a ploy to create obstacles on our way to development the developed countries should help us with low carbon technology

8870506 in todays media environment it is vital that businesses communicate online and companies that choose to ignore this are running a major risk traditional pr tactics are not going to go away anytime soon but it is essential for companies to integrate online pr and social media into their existing offline communications strategies
8870507 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focused on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications

8870577 channels in bacteria perform absolutely key roles in cell survival we have been able to show how this channel opens and closes understanding how they work will play a major role in inhibiting the survival of bacteria and could have applications as basic as cleansing hospital equipment and wards or helping to make food safer these channels are found in mrsa and c difficile and this knowledge has not yet been exploited the future path is to find new chemicals and processes that exploit the importance of the channels to these bacteria
8870578 the system is mechanical the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8870579 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8870580 new chemicals designed to force channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader

8870586 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8870587 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8870588 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8870589 this conference aims to encourage the nhs to recognise the power of music as a crucial form of treatment and health promotion we are delighted to welcome a wealth of experts from across the globe who will provide groundbreaking insights into the enormous value of music and singing on health and well being
8870590 the evidence shows that the contribution of arts and health is grossly underestimated by many healthcare professionals the royal society for public health encourages all organisations involved in healthcare to invest in these evidence based interventions this conference will hopefully raise awareness about the health outcomes possible and in particular the contribution singing makes to health improvement
8870591 the work of the sidney de haan centre could provide some important pointers as to how we can use the arts to improve the quality of life right across our community i am very pleased that my family trust is continuing to support the research that is taking place and i hope that this conference will help to generate much greater awareness of the potential benefits of involvement with the arts
8870592 an active engagement with music can be good for an older persons overall physical and mental health i will particularly focus on the positive effects of singing on the mind and the immune system and how music and art can have positive influences on the course of illness with aging

8870610 last year with derrick we did some things that we didnt do with tony
8870611 derrick can also run the ball as well as anyone we got out there if you can highlight a guy a certain way because he has different skills you do so
8870612 we dont necessarily have to take him out if we want a wide receiver in there because he has such great hands
8870613 theres a number of different things you can do with him and were going to find ways to do things with him much like weve done with jeremy maclin
8870614 this 7 4 million grant will provide texans with temporary jobs assisting in disaster relief and clean up efforts to help communities recover from hurricane dolly damage
8870615 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8870616 they have quite remarkable planning and self organisation more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8870617 but unlike old school mind melds this seemingly psychic communication would be computer mediated

8870619 there was a launch a few days ago of something and it is not quite clear what it was
8870620 advanced technology to launch its first remote sensing telecommunication satellite into space
8870621 they want to be able to build their own satellites they want to be able to launch their own satellites
8870622 no the satellite that was launched has a camera but it is not a camera that can bring you pictures good enough for any other purpose not a resolution that would allow you any military significance
8870623 i think one of the issues people are looking at is is the technology iran is developing now purely indigenous or are they getting outside assistance
8870624 the most likely source of outside assistance would be possibly north korea but more likely pakistan the recent ballistic missile that the iranians launched the so called ashoura missile may be a derivative of a pakistani design
8870625 where everyone is concerned because that technology is dual use and could also be used directly in military applications with warheads
8870626 what they showed on television in february was definitely a shahab 3 however at least one of the sources i read said that what was actually launched or tested in february was not a shahab and that the footage that they released did not belong to the vehicle actually tested
8870627 it looks like the iranians are moving away from liquid fuel missiles to solid fuel missiles and that is a big technological leap
8870628 if you are looking to have a military program solid fuel rockets are the way to go because you dont have to have all the fuelling trucks you dont have to have all the associated infrastructure you can fire them on much shorter notice
8870629 so if it is the case that iran is indeed moving towards solid propellant ballistic missiles that would have important military implications
8870630 it is not so much the satellite capability per se but if iran were to eventually develop the capability to launch satellites into medium and high earth orbit to have that capability means that you are also going to have the capability to manufacture ballistic missiles that can deliver a military payload to quite some distance well in excess of 2 000km
8870631 most countries in the middle east have their own communication satellite which they bought egypt has one turkey has several saudi arabia has too the uae has the most advanced communication satellite in the world
8870632 the iranians have been trying to do the same for the past 30 years and the project is not getting off the ground
8870633 it has a camera but i dont think it has any military significance it is a research satellite with the goal of training engineers to be able to build satellites to be able to conduct experiments in space
8870634 they are building with the help of some western companies their own research satellite but this is very very rudimentary
8870635 israel is much much more advanced than any other countries in the middle east with the ofeq and eros military imaging satellites

8870647 i agree that facts must be checked and analysis must be scrutinized but at the same time i do trust the work of the tippet herron llc group that has slaved away for nearly a decade now developing cornerstone theories in modern middle east e gaming development thinking
8870648 the research from the calkins manners inc group is ground breaking but at the same time solidifies a number of ideas that have been prolierated in the middle east e gaming development community now for years i for one am going to purchase the book attend the seminar and join in every conference discussion i can
8870649 i firmly believe that moving forward we must keep an optimistic view point and liberal stance in these middle east e gaming development matters if we lean back too much and stay conservative were going to remain in the dark ages forever and will not be able to continue to modernize our views i follow the comments of barker sze and kasparek thoene from the second panel
8870650 i have nothing but respect for the work of stripling bishard in the middle east e gaming development field but we must proceed with caution and consider all ideas on the table if we blindly accept the work of a few thinkers without questioning the validity of their thought we are all wasting our time
8870651 the origins of middle east e gaming development bewilder most people
8870652 but not me and with the work of duron badillo to guide us forward i think things will become a lot cleared in the middle east e gaming development community
8870653 we have to improve and it has to happen quickly

8870688 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8870689 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8870690 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8870691 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
8870692 and they were talking just about money money money money money
8870693 i dont think that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation im sure that that poor guy is not sophisticated and clever and capable enough to carry out that job

8870708 the aussie has generally pushed up higher in the last couple of domestic sessions only to come back down through the overnight session off the back of us data
8870709 generally data this week has been surprising on the upside out of the us so people might have wanted to avoid that volatility
8870710 we have not taken any knee jerk reactions but what we are doing is looking properly and professionally at what needs to be done to ensure profit and sustainability
8870711 the two issues impacting us are the credit crunch and rising oil costs and these market conditions are making things quite difficult
8870712 i dont expect any job cuts but we are looking at what we need to do holistically
8870713 the closest weve come to job cuts is to stop recruitment

8870736 siapa yang mendirikan shalat di malam ramadhan dengan penuh keimanan dan harapan maka ia diampuni dosa dosanya yang telah lampau
8870737 nabi tidak pernah melakuka shalat malam lebih dari 11 rakaat baik di bulan ramadhan maupun di luar ramadhan
8870738 perbedaan yang terjadi dalam jumlah rakaat tarawih mucul dikarenakan panjang dan pendeknya rakaat yang didirikan jika dalam mendirikannya dengan rakaat rakaat yang panjang maka berakibat pada sedikitnya jumlah rakaat dan demikian sebaliknya
8870739 jika shalatnya panjang dan jumlah rakaatnya sedikit itu baik menurutku dan jika shalat nya pendek jumlah rakaatnya banyak itu juga baik menurutku sekalipun aku lebih senang pada yang pertama
8870740 ayo sholat berjamaah anda saja yang mengimami anda mempunyai hapalan lebih banyak dan bacaan lebih fasih karena kita sama sama muslim

8870744 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek one was taking photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers
8870745 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8870746 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8870747 i think it sends a message and a statement of what we are about
8870748 i think people now understand that actually man city is a place that is an interesting thought for many people at the moment
8870749 players want to come and join us they can see the ambition that we have and where we want to go we have the means to attract top quality players which shaun obviously is there arent many days left in the window and hopefully well be able to attract more before it closes
8870750 anyone could play against andorra but croatia is different you need players who are 100 per cent
8870751 we sent owen to the right specialist and he had the right treatment so it is just a matter of him getting on with it now it has not been easy for him having tendinitis can be irritating for a player
8870752 but he has trained for ten days and it is now important to give him some minutes on the pitch i think it the england games will be too early for him he is not ready for that
8870753 it is a great challenge for us first of all we have to progress from the group stage and to do that you need ten points to qualify the tournament really kicks off in february that is when it gets exciting the one off knock out stages
8870754 i think we have a squad to challenge the best but you cannot think of yourselves as favourites when you see teams like ac milan barcelona and juventus all great names we will make sure we apply ourselves in the right way then we will have a chance
8870755 it has been well documented that he wasnt happy with some of the comments but i was delighted to sort it out with him and we had a good chat
8870756 sure i did raise a few questions about tactics and the sight of steven gerrard playing on the left wing for england against the czechs last week
8870757 i replied i think youre right mate from then on it was a great opportunity to talk about a few things and get a few things straight one of which is that among the points i raised i made it clear i have enormous respect for capello the guy has a superb record and if he cannot make a success of the england team no one can
8870758 when you send him forth free from you you shall not send him forth empty handed you shall surely provide him from your flock from your threshing floor and from your vat you shall give him from what the lord your god has blessed you you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of egypt and the lord your god redeemed you therefore i am commanding you this thing today
8870759 you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of egypt and the lord your god redeemed you
8870760 the children of israel did according to moshes instructions and they asked from the egyptians silver objects golden objects and garments the lord gave the people favor in the eyes of the egyptians
8870761 im pretty good dealing with raw meat give me a grill and i can hold my own the actor said with a laugh phoning from his new york home but thats about it
8870762 most of the cooking you see me do in this film proves how good i am as an actor he added laughing even louder however the kitchen skills exhibited in for the love of grace 8 p m saturday hallmark channel are only a subtext to the film what this is really about is showing how two very emotionally wounded people come together and find a way to help each other heal consuelos said in the film steve is battling depression following the death of his wife in an automobile accident he is bothered by the fact that he spends his life saving strangers but was unable to save the one person he treasures the most given that consuelos and his real life wife actress and tv talk show star kelly ripa have been very public about their devotion to each other did the possibility of a similar tragedy in real life cross consuelos mind when he read the script thats the kind of thing you just cannot think about it would be so terrible and unimaginable
8870763 i focused more on how this guy and his brother and chandra wests character worked through their relationships its what gives the film a story that i think people will find very compelling
8870764 everything really goes in a new and different direction when my character saves a woman from an apartment house fire i just happen to be walking by said consuelos after rescuing grace steve discovers shes as wounded as he is added consuelos she has recently lost a father she worshipped has become a total workaholic and obsessed with finding a perfect life and perfect husband
8870765 it dont go near as far enough as it did 10 years ago
8870766 we need change hes right thats kinda what he stands for is us
8870767 its evidence that weve arrived at the point where people of diversity can run for the highest office in the land
8870768 im always willing to listen to a different point of view
8870769 while he cast a large net out he left a hole in it
8870770 he still has not committed himself to the most innocent the unborn
8870771 for a long time this country has been about what divides us
8870772 we were together then and we need to be together now
8870773 i needed to be here i needed to do whatever was necessary
8870774 to me this is one of the most exciting times
8870775 this could be one of the biggest nights of our lifetime
8870776 the fact that were the host town makes it even more
8870777 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8870778 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well michael medved gt
8870779 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8870780 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war
8870781 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8870782 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8870783 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8870784 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8870785 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8870786 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8870787 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8870788 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8870789 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8870790 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8870791 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8870792 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8870793 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8870794 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8870795 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8870796 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8870797 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8870798 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8870799 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8870800 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation
8870801 el 4 de noviembre debemos ponernos de pie y decir ocho a os es suficiente
8870802 nos hallamos nuevamente en esos momentos decisivos nuestra naci n est en guerra nuestra econom a est en turbulencia y la promesa de ee uu ha sido amenazada nuevamente

8870804 muchos de ustedes tienen autos que no pueden conducir tarjetas de cr dito que no pueden pagar el fracaso no se debe solamente a las pol ticas fallidas de washington sino tambi n a la presidencia de george bush
8870805 somos el partido de roosevelt el partido de kennedy por lo tanto no me digan que los dem cratas no defenderemos este pa s
8870806 nunca dudar en defender esta naci n pero s lo enviar tropas a la guerra con una misi n clara y el compromiso sagrado de darles el equipo que necesiten en combate y los beneficios que se merecen cuando regresen a casa
8870807 reconstruir nuestras fuerzas armadas para poder enfrentar conflictos futuros pero tambi n renovar la diplomacia dura y directa que puede prevenir que ir n obtenga armas nucleares
8870808 si mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n va a ser el pr ximo comandante en jefe se es un debate que quiero tener
8870809 hace cuatro a os me present y les cont mi historia de la breve uni n de un joven de kenia y una joven de kansas que no ten an muchos recursos pero compart an la creencia de que en ee uu su hijo podr a lograr lo que se propusiera
8870810 queremos abrir esta convenci n para estar seguros de que los que quieran venir puedan unirse a nuestro partido y unirse al esfuerzo de recuperar nuestro ee uu
8870811 nosotros no estamos construyendo nuestra campa a electoral de arriba para abajo sino de abajo para arriba
8870812 temos tudo planejado se a s rie acabar nesta oitava temporada mas se a emissora quiser uma nona estaremos prontos com esta renova o que acontecer

8870816 pienso que el trabajo que se est haciendo es necesario y poco a poco va a empezar a dar sus frutos pero los beneficios reales vendr n con el cambio en el formato de la competici n suprimiremos la copa intertoto de la uefa y se crear una fase de grupos muy similar a la de la uefa champions league
8870817 queremos tener un concepto centralizado de la fase de grupos de la copa de la uefa que le dar una presencia m s fuerte en el mercado y una mayor autonom a queremos ir potenciando la competici n con el paso de los a os

8870820 jugu ese partido hace nueve a os y probablemente no preparamos el partido de la debida manera d ndole una importancia menor de la que realmente ten a ten amos partidos de liga antes y despu s de aquel encuentro y nos centramos m s en ellos aunque en esta ocasi n no ser as por lo que no tendremos excusa tenemos que ir y ganar es un t tulo que muchos de nosotros no hemos ganado y eso es un incentivo m s
8870821 siempre es un gran reto ganar esta competici n pero sabemos que tenemos equipo para aspirar a ello tenemos muchos futbolistas con un gran potencial ofensivo
8870822 para m esa fue una de las claves la temporada pasada contar con varios futbolistas capaces de cambiar el signo de un partido somos un equipo joven y no hay razones para pensar que no podamos volver a conseguirlo ganar la liga y la champions nos permite disputar competiciones como la de esta noche y hay que seguir siendo ambiciosos nuestra intenci n siempre es la de ganar y para eso hay que seguir intentando mejorar como equipo hemos demostrado mucha consistencia las ltimas dos temporadas y hay que seguir en esa l nea
8870823 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8870824 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8870825 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8870826 we want to know how the brain areas that encode memory are organized
8870827 if your memory is affected by aging or alzheimers disease is there a way to learn that can capitalize on the brain structures that may still be working well
8870828 grant almighty god since we have already entered in hope upon the threshold of our eternal inheritance and know that there is a certain mansion for us in heaven after christ has been received there who is our head and the first fruits of our salvation grant i say that we may proceed more and more in the course of thy holy calling until at length we reach the goal and so enjoy that eternal glory of which thou affordest us a taste in this world by the same christ our lord amen
8870829 after finishing this last lecture that most illustrious man john calvin the divine who had previously been sick then began to be so much weaker that he was compelled to recline on a couch and could no longer proceed with the explanation of ezekiel this accounts for his stopping at the close of the twentieth chapter and not finishing the work so auspiciously begun nothing remains kind reader but that you receive most favourably and graciously what is now sent forth to the world

8870832 part of the aim of this initiative is to promote a more progressive commercial culture in the caribbean that will allow for the easier movement of more goods and services across regional borders which is what the caricom single market is all about
8870833 what we are also seeking to do is to embrace small craftsmen both in guyana and elsewhere in the caribbean whose operations do not allow for resource allocation for marketing by providing affordable opportunities for their products to reach the wider regional market
8870834 part of what motivated us was the realization that most companies in guyana and elsewhere in caricom have not taken advantage of the tremendous marketing potential which is available through the internet
8870835 attract sliding scales of charges which would not be applicable with the online business
8870836 such a service would be particularly important to recipients of small amounts of cash
8870837 people are still sending large amounts of barrels back to their relatives and friends what we seek to do through our on line service is to save people the valuable time spent acquiring and shipping these items what our research has also indicated to us is that retail prices for some of the items shipped to guyana in barrels are significantly lower here than in north american european and other caribbean markets when you consider the time factor involved in purchasing high priced retail items and time spent packing barrels together with the cost of shipping the problems associated with customs clearance and delivery it would be much easier and cheaper to shop online
8870838 as a company iamgold has a responsibility both to the government and the people of guyana and to the international community to ensure that when we cease operations here we leave the area in a state that is as close as possible to the state in which we met it
8870839 all of the area within the omai concession west of the omai river
8870840 all attempts made by officers of the ggmc and the police to extricate these miners have been unsuccessful
8870841 this is all taking place in areas previously untouched by omai and is making it impossible for the company to conduct a proper environmental closure for those areas
8870842 the area will be re vegetated and reclaimed and as far as possible we will be seeking to return it to a state of nature this is both in keeping with our agreement with the government of guyana and as part of our corporate responsibility
8870843 the problem here is that the small business council has been asked to secure a consultancy to outline its programme of activities and this has not been produced as yet
8870844 my own impression is that the president is supportive of the small business community
8870845 there is an urgent need for a robust response to the needs of the small business community many owners of small and micro enterprises live from day to day and depend on their daily earnings to support their families
8870846 no me gusta que alguien tenga mayor a cuanto m s diseminado est el poder mucho mejor
8870847 si no hay esa mayor a las cosas se pueden discutir
8870848 estoy convencido de que lo que dijo lo dijo de buena fe es posible pero no probable
8870849 no veo ning n tipo de relaci n entre las tuber as y un club de f tbol
8870850 la situaci n actual por la que atraviesa el equipo es la mejor de los ltimos a os hay que ver si el intentar cotas m s altas es fruto de un proyecto o de una locura el mallorca es un equipo modesto con sus limitaciones yo como aficionado me conformo con lo que hay
8870851 los personajes son oscuros sus relaciones son poco transparentes y en el f tbol lo m s importante es la claridad que lo puedan entender todas las clases sociales y que tambi n lo haga el aficionado de a pie
8870852 yo creo en la econom a de libre mercado cualquiera que tenga dinero puede comprar
8870853 nadie va a poder comprar el sentimiento la propiedad puede ser de quien sea pero lo an mico lo que sienten los aficionados no se puede comprar
8870854 el mallorca de momento no es de champions pero me parece un buen deseo
8870855 mientras este se or no sea propietario no creo que haya que hacer comentarios cuando lo sea y
8870856 que sea una persona de inglatera de madrid o de otro sitio da igual lo importante es que se respete la propiedad moral
8870857 chiss se prima o poi i manager riusciranno a capirlo e inizieranno a far fare questo lavoro a degli esperti invece che ai soliti junior che non hanno nessuna esperienza per farlo schematics
8870858 we need to prove that coal at harworth is of the quality we believe it to be and it is workable and accessible
8870859 we seek spiritual satisfaction gods name is food for the soul
8870860 i enjoy the training its hard but i like boxing so i never become tired of it
8870861 since her commencement in the sport she has only taken part in the emancipation day boxing tournament in port kaituma
8870862 it is the government that must act to end the problem
8870863 the art of storytelling is still powerful whether it is spoken word or calypso or soca and artists still have something to say
8870864 when people say that the oral tradition is dying they dont know what they are talking about
8870865 its about reminding them who they are and where they come from
8870866 a man without history is like a tree without roots
8870867 the music being played now is all about sex and we know that sex sells
8870868 the real music hardly gets the airplay because sex is in demand
8870869 wherever evil is you still have good bad could never conquer good
8870870 we have yet to capture the possibilities that the electronic media has produced in todays society
8870871 we still have to find a way to bring what we do into the living rooms of everyday people it is difficult but not impossible
8870872 take me down i cant do this please i cant do this anymore
8870873 i went with this name because everyone playing games becomes a million dollars worth of smiling faces its the duty of ekubo kun the entertainer to spread the fun of xbox 360 games to people all over the world
8870874 the donation will go a long way in assisting the youths of the club
8870875 it teaches coordination helps to keep one fit and gives a sense of belonging and most importantly it encourages teamwork
8870876 over the years we have been producing some of the best youths in football
8870877 we are trying to do our part in bringing up the youngsters to love and appreciate the game and in the coming weeks we will be approaching other sponsors
8870878 it can communicate emotions ideas as well stories to the people
8870879 dance can also to touch on a few key social issues
8870880 all day all night i can expect them to put in the hard work
8870881 i have heard the arguments for the copying and sale of books including school texts at prices below the published prices and i do not accept those arguments
8870882 i cannot understand how we can accept providing an education for our children based on a practice that amounts to no more than stealing from the very people whose books play a role in providing that education there is no integrity or morality in that position
8870883 while we treat the copying and sale of published texts as a measure designed to provide cheap books the fact of the matter is that it amounts to stealing and in many cases we are stealing from very ordinary people writers who may have published one or two books at great sacrifice and who look forward to earning something for their effort
8870884 if the government decides that there will be no copyright infringement the law of the land comes in and the offenders can be charged it is definitely a government responsibility we cannot steal to educate our children
8870885 stealing from writers and publishers cannot be justified under any circumstance
8870886 there has to be other approaches to dealing with the problem
8870887 government has been allocating more and more money annually for the procurement of medicine and medical supplies because we are cognizant that adequate supplies of drugs and an effective chain supply system meaning that drugs have to reach all health facilities on time are two very important aspects for proper health care delivery
8870888 health care workers have been trained to change their gloves after every patient and to change the syringes after every use we never in guyana reuse a syringe so you can imagine the number of syringes that is used in the sector it is enormous and it is not just for injection of medicines
8870889 for the first time goods and medicines such as vaccines are stored in a cold storage facility
8870890 i think guyanese need to reflect a little because back in 1991 guyana spent less than 100m on medical supplies today we have increased that to about 2b
8870891 did not take part in any regional cricket for over four years they put in an impressive performance
8870892 i think it was an achievement on the part of the girls having been in the cricket wilderness for an extended period of time
8870893 we are making every effort to put womens cricket back on the local map

8870996 i was on the zoom flight from halifax in canada to london gatwick this morning the flight had already been delayed and then cancelled yesterday evening we were rescheduled for this morning
8870997 we had boarded the flight and sat for an hour and a half we were then told we all had to disembark again the pilot was left to tell all the passengers that there would no longer be a flight and the reasons for this
8870998 the crew had presumably just been told that not only had they lost their jobs but that they had to find their own way back to the uk
8870999 i was impressed by the composure professionalism and the helpfulness of the zoom crew and the airport staff meanwhile i am still in halifax and have to take three flights tomorrow to get back home
8871000 we were initially told the plane was delayed because of technical problems
8871001 after that we heard it was something to do with payment problems
8871002 some people here are very angry and there seems to be a complete lack of information
8871003 its quite frustrating knowing that the plane is on the tarmac but that we cant get on it
8871004 we arrived at calgary airport at 4pm wednesday but were not allowed to check in for our glasgow flight due to a technical problem
8871005 ninety minutes later we were told that the aircraft was unserviceable and that the earliest we could fly out was saturday 30 august we were meant to be in work friday
8871006 we were informed that there would be no compensation or help with accommodation or subsistence
8871007 this morning we learned that the company has gone bankrupt and so at the moment we are still in canada unsure of when we are going home
8871008 luckily we are with a travel company who are doing their best to sort us out with a flight home
8871009 i had literally booked a flight to canada for christmas yesterday
8871010 now i have to wait 12 weeks for the credit card company to refund the fare because thats how long their dispute process takes
8871011 in the meantime im out of pocket for the 1 000 a replacement flight is going to cost and not so much as an automated e mail from zoom bad form
8871012 we had to wait an hour and a half to get to the desk and when we got there they said the flight had been delayed 12 hours
8871013 we asked why and they said they didnt know even the information desk for zoom couldnt tell us anything so weve been left in the dark
8871014 we were looking forward to this holiday for ages i cant feel any worse than i feel now
8871015 there are 10 of us hoping zoom continue to operate five band members one manager and four fans going to belfast to play at and observe the open house festival on 22 september
8871016 i was due to fly tomorrow so they basically let me know 18 hours before and i guess everybody else as well so at the moment ive got flights tomorrow morning out of new york on a different airline back into london so i should still get in on saturday

8871123 demi moores dancing up on me and humping me from behind the one part thats not in the book is that she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends
8871124 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me how do i get breast milk out of my black dress and i said how the f k would i know call demi
8871125 it was hysterical there are no pictures of it but it actually happened the lawyers didnt think it was wise for me to print that so theres your juicy tidbit
8871126 government agencies from local louisiana parishes to the white house reported that that new orleans levees
8871127 ive gotten reports this morning that there is already water coming over some of the levee systems in the lower ninth ward weve had one of our pumping stations to stop operating so we will have significant flooding it is just a matter of how much
8871128 flooding is significant throughout the region and a levee in new orleans has reportedly been breached sending 6 8 feet of water throughout the 9th ward area of the city
8871129 this is to put it mildly the big one i think
8871130 this is a category 5 hurricane very similar to hurricane andrew in the maximum intensity but theres a big big difference this hurricane is much larger than andrew ever was i also want to make absolutely clear to everyone that the greatest potential for large loss of lives is still in the coastal areas from the storm surge i dont think anyone can tell you with any confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not but theres obviously a very very grave concern
8871131 i spoke to mike chertoff today hes the head of the department of homeland security i knew people would want me to discuss this issue immigration so we got us an airplane on a telephone on air force one so i called him i said are you working with the governor he said you bet we are

8871146 we regret that the office of the high commissioner for human rights has issued a statement on the situation in jammu and kashmir this is uncalled for and irresponsible
8871147 terrorist groups have targeted innocent civilians they have not refrained from taking women and children as hostages as in the recent incident in jammu
8871148 in all their actions against terrorists personnel of the security forces have sought to ensure that no innocent lives are lost and for this objective have on many occasions laid down their lives
8871149 calling on the indian authorities and in particular security forces to respect the right to freedom of assembly and expression and comply with international human rights principles in controlling the demonstrators
8871150 the use of force should be proportionate to the threat posed and firearms must only be used in dispersing a violent assembly to protect individuals against an imminent threat of death or serious injury
8871151 if we want to get to double digits we need to target 2016 and start working from today
8871152 but the respective federations have no vision and i dont see that changing i wish i had a magic solution but unfortunately i dont the ioa has to play a role in building athletes it does nothing
8871153 be on good terms with officials because one needs to survive
8871154 but most officials and many of the so called coaches who travel with the teams know nothing about the sport
8871155 the athletes dont talk about this because their careers are at stake and the officials unfortunately dont care

8871159 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8871160 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8871161 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8871162 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8871163 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8871164 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people

8871169 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8871170 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8871171 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions
8871172 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous

8871177 two hours outside of phoenix what you find is death by thirst
8871178 there are some programs out there that are willing to pay a lucrative amount
8871179 its market driven its economics if youre bringing in 95 000 into a home game youre making well over 3 to 4 million would you rather pay someone 1 million and make 2 to 3 million
8871180 he became a hero for my linemen when they heard he eats 8 000 to 10 000 calories a day
8871181 i asked them do you understand how much he works out if he puts away 10 000 calories a day
8871182 they say he didnt want to lose a race even in practice
8871183 was everybody else was breathing hard he just won the race and he looked like im ready to go again his conditioning was amazing
8871184 i think hes going to have some other things in his plans
8871185 with young guys you do a lot of teaching a lot of drill instruction fundamental work
8871186 tackle phil loadholt played in junior college last year was his first year of playing big time football hell be more confident for being in this environment the rest of these guys have been around here for four years it gives you some confidence they see things they see things coming they know what to look for
8871187 if we just spread people out and let the quarterback drop back and throw like the pros you could play a consistent defense but now youve got teams with two split receivers with runners and with quarterbacks who can run the option as well as throw this simply generates more offense than any defense can handle

8871220 in light of the current economic conditions we believe that it is timely to consider whether the guidance for directors on going concern remains appropriate and whether it can be improved
8871221 the frc believes that the going concern basis of accounting is so fundamental to the preparation of financial statements that directors should continue to be required to make an explicit written statement in the annual report regarding the appropriateness of the use of the going concern assumption the frc believes that directors should disclose in their statement when the period they have reviewed in making their assessment of going concern does not extend to at least 12 months from the date of their approval of the financial statements
8871222 employers might not agree but in the past five years job seekers have had a slight advantage in being able to switch between jobs relatively easily if they have been unhappy within their current position the concern around the stability of the economy has led to a reduction in confidence and a reluctancy to move

8871246 we focus on a single level of hygiene and safety for all consumers of products produced in canada

8871257 weve made it very clear that our policy is not to recruit league players
8871258 thats because of the structure in terms of how were funding the clubs and the top end of the game
8871259 it would have to be an extraordinary situation for england manager martin johnson to come to us recommending a league player and for us to sign him

8871435 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8871436 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8871437 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8871455 the achievements of middle class majority ethnic white irish students are not and never were under threat yet this ultimately is what is driving this campaign
8871456 commodities the stuff that feeds us runs our cars heats our homes and provides the basic materials of everyday life recently enjoyed one of the great bull runs of modern investment history nearly doubling in price in the space of a year

8871458 oh well if youre going to play in the champions league you might as well come up against the champions league champions it doesnt get any easier does it
8871459 you have to be honest about it and say this is an even stronger manchester united than the manchester united we faced two years ago
8871460 this time they are champions of europe and champions of england they are a better team now and that will make our job even harder
8871461 its disappointing for sure but the car just got sideways and on full opposite lock i ended up cutting a corner too much and it just went over
8871462 we were pushing pretty hard this morning and maybe a little harder after the service but its just disappointing that we werent able to get closer to the pace
8871463 we seem to be giving away a little more in the slow stuff than the fast but then its all relative as there are fewer corners in the fast
8871464 the grip was pretty tricky this morning but much better on the second passes as road cleaning from the cars ahead of him is a big factor
8871465 theres no miracle cure as theres no single thing we can pinpoint but well take tomorrow as more testing and mileage and see what were able to do
8871466 west coast are going to come here and i know they havent got much of a team but we want to give them the hardest day they are ever going to have in their life
8871467 it depends on the way bombers going about it whether it was at us or was at his players trying to get them fired up
8871468 if it was at us its not the way wed like to see things said but the world turns and it turns very quickly in this game
8871469 theyre odds on favourite to win the premiership it would be shattering if they finish anywhere less
8871470 and i suppose its like back in the early 1990s they were odds on favourites to win a lot of things and didnt do it so well just wait and see
8871471 its a different make up of the side weve got a young group theres so many different players playing from last time
8871472 last time we played the cats it was disappointing it was very ordinary so hopefully tomorrow the boys will put a good foot forward
8871473 games are forgotten pretty quickly in this caper because you have to and like i said geelong can say what they want its their time in the sun at the moment and nobody can question that
8871474 but the world turns and you wouldnt want to be saying too much about other sides and how theyre going
8871475 this is the first time in seven years since ive been at the club as a coach that ive been in this position and probably even as a player me and john
8871476 its just a number on the back really i played more of a ball playing role this year anyway
8871477 theres no doubt this is going to be a tough game but we will go into it some confidence and hopefully get a good win
8871478 we need to keep winning to shore up a final spot so we will be focussed on the cowboys on saturday night
8871479 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
8871480 the message to the players is dont worry about things that are out of your control
8871481 what i say in the media what adam goodes says in the media what brett kirk says in the media all thats irrelevant really
8871482 they are a group that is really finding it hard to come up with answers and as a coach my message to them is the answers are on the field
8871483 the answers wont be found in a video session or a game plan book the answers are out on the scg tomorrow night and they are very very simple
8871484 but its about actions i can talk they can talk we can all talk its not hard to do that
8871485 we started off the season people said we couldnt make the eight weve done that again
8871486 there are now some questions about us again and hopefully we can answer those questions also
8871487 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well
8871488 and thats the challenge for all of us tomorrow night is to get back into form
8871489 the disappointment that were not going to play finals that will hang around for a long time
8871490 but hopefully its not an issue in terms of tomorrows game
8871491 i genuinely feel were going in with an exceptionally good chance
8871492 the swans have had a few weeks where things havent gone great for them so from that point of view we are pretty optimistic
8871493 certainly investors are staying away from the housing market in droves
8871494 weaker motor vehicle sales less purchases on credit cards and evaporating interest in margin trading have seen consumer credit contract further this month
8871495 the survey showed that capital spending intentions remain solid with firms intending to boost spending 32 per cent in the year ending june 2009 it appears that the business investment cycle is far from over
8871496 we anticipate that credit growth should begin to show signs of improvement in 2009 as interest rates are cut further from mid next year and conditions and sentiment begin to improve
8871497 were aware of all the constraints around that week but we havent got a preferred outcome because we dont know what the results of the games beforehand are going to be
8871498 with all the finals venues and the potential clashes we tend not to worry too much about them because you finish up worrying about things that dont happen
8871499 potentially for a grand final qualifier clearly telstra dome would be our preference
8871500 if we want to play it at telstra dome its only available saturday thats a pretty clear choice if we want to play it at telstra dome
8871501 i think there will be a lot of people interested to come straight from an afl grand final straight to a major rugby league final
8871502 thats up to us to increase our awareness and do all we can to make people aware of the importance of the game
8871503 thats the way channel nine and the nrl hold the games and we think it will be an interesting exercise
8871504 well play any time anywhere provided its played here in melbourne
8871505 were confident that it will sell well and we can get as much of melbourne as we can behind us
8871506 its very good obviously for our team but i also think for the game
8871507 just looking at the incident it would have been pretty harsh to get a week for that
8871508 maybe im talking a bit out of school here but thats how i saw it and obviously the judiciary saw that again today so its good for us and its good for the game
8871509 i always thought i had a reasonably strong case but that in itself is never enough in these sort of things
8871510 our position was we agreed with the referee lyndon brays call in the game and he got the call from the assistant bryce lawrence so we agreed with that
8871511 i think that what they were looking at was if it was unusually dangerous i think it was just the interpretation of dangerous
8871512 theres just no point in worrying about those things just get on and do your best and dont let it distract you essentially
8871513 we get enough injuries let alone other sources of absence and those challenges players dont enjoy and rightly so
8871514 were conscious of the fact theres the prospect he may not be there but were conscious of the fact of the prospect he may be there and he does have a good background of preparation anyway
8871515 weve got a really great record at ellis park 29 wins in 41 tests and it always feels great to play a test at this venue
8871516 no test match is a dead rubber even though there will be no trophies to be won on saturday we have to show we are on the right track
8871517 theres still the end of year tour to come and we dont want to go on that trip thinking about whether we should change things or worry if things are working or not
8871518 we want to get some confidence out of this game
8871519 it was a temptation to make changes but i studied the game and i felt we werent too bad
8871520 if we lose three in a row how can you change that winning and losing are the same thing to me its just that winning is much nicer
8871521 maybe our fire wasnt hot enough last week maybe we didnt have the right pots and pans hopefully we can eat the food this weekend
8871522 the meeting was held in a good spirit and we spoke openly about the issues
8871523 it was good to meet and discuss areas of concern and going forward we are now much clearer from both sides

8871529 em minhas pesquisas notei que mesmo pessoas felizes no casamento s vezes traem por curiosidade para testar o poder de sedu o ou para chamar a aten o do c njuge

8871548 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8871549 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8871550 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it

8871562 theyve been saying loud and clear that they feel they could do whatever they want with impunity
8871563 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil
8871564 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
8871565 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8871566 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations

8871574 im hoping that sen meeks will be inspired by barack obamas remarks tonight to the point where he redoubles his efforts to bring our leaders together
8871575 the senate president agreed and the speaker of the house agreed
8871576 the governor never did agree and theres just no more time i cant start everything in motion and pull it back it would make me look uncommitted
8871577 he hit on a lot of good issues that are affecting america and most importantly michigan obama appeared to understand the working and middle class struggles in his speech he understands that we are the ones who have to worry about our next paycheck the point of the speech that i like the most was obamas counterattack on the republicans and john mccains attacks obama has sat back long enough and has not responded strong enough to mccains political attacks it was good to see that biden is not going to be obamas protector obama can stand up for himself i did not like obamas reference to jfk a couple of times in the speech obama has to represent himself as a powerful leader and not rely on comparison to other great leaders
8871578 obama had me at hello i was impressed by his delivery this evening sen obama was forceful confident and responded to every critical remark that the mccain camp has made about him he focused on the issues and provided concrete details i will be one of those republicans he mentioned who will elect a democrat for president this november
8871579 obama showed us he has great ideas for the country i enjoyed his energy his concrete ideas and his head on approach to the top issues of the campaign he definitely exceeded the expectation for tonight i am excited his speech electrified the audience and citizens across the country tonight is a great milestone for his campaign and a great moment in our nations history
8871580 obama says that a vote for him is a vote to ensure the american way as if its in danger yet the time leading up to that point is spent telling everyone how he is here as a result of the american way i dont buy that there is less opportunity today than there was 40 years ago he was too negative dont tell me all thats wrong thats not how you got where you are be positive
8871581 it was the right speech for this point in the campaign the oratory soared challenges were defined and specific changes outlined i liked his firmness of resolve especially his challenge to john mc cain to debate his readiness to be commander in chief a truly inspiring speech which climaxed a very successful convention
8871582 barack obama spoke to the real people of america i was pleased that he addressed the day to day issues facing americans today and can relate to them personally but with so much on the plate i am still wondering if it will be too much for one man to accomplish
8871583 obama has the character temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief his acceptance speech met my expectations and further convinced me that he is the person i trust most to take the united states of america into the future with a responsible approach finding common ground and representing the diverse population of this country
8871584 i really like that senator obama sees what we as americans can be that we are more than the problems that stand in our way i agree that overcoming those problems will require our individual and mutual responsibility i like that he can disagree with someone respect their point of view and find a workable middle ground he met my expectations as a speaker especially toward the last half of the speech i thought his speech started off slow but really gained momentum and by the time he finished he was rolling best of all he started his speech before 10 30 something i wish the others had done
8871585 he wants dignity and respect for all children but he didnt mention the unborn children he wont be able to end our dependence on foreign oil in 10 years unless we go to nuclear power he wanted to cut taxes on everybody but he didnt mention the alternative minimum tax
8871586 i liked how obama related himself with the average blue collar american he placed responsibility on all americans to help make the changes that our nation needs government can lead the way but if we dont follow change will not happen
8871587 but cant we have two presidents by letting al gore serve with him to make up for 2000
8871588 there was a lot i liked about obamas speech but the the themes i found most inspiring our sense of common purpose individual responsibility and mutual respect the fact that change happens because the people demand it and that we are better than these last eight years my sister who is not really into politics called me right after the speech sounding more excited than ive ever heard her
8871589 our whole goal is to turn the 75 000 people here in this stadium into grass roots volunteers
8871590 this is all about neighbors talking to neighbors family members talking to family members
8871591 its a dream of mine come true an unbelievable miracle
8871592 last time i worked for a presidential campaign was mcgovern
8871593 obama is getting people excited who havent been excited for a long time
8871594 registration deadlines will be here before we know it so we need to reach out to every single person who we think might support barack obama and joe biden and get them registered
8871595 and over half the states have early vote so voting will begin in earnest in a lot of places in about five weeks there is no time to lose
8871596 oh well if youre going to play in the champions league you might as well come up against the champions league champions it doesnt get any easier does it
8871597 you have to be honest about it and say this is an even stronger manchester united than the manchester united we faced two years ago
8871598 this time they are champions of europe and champions of england they are a better team now and that will make our job even harder
8871599 you will not pay your bills with ads by google
8871600 ladies and gentlemen in my estimation i feel we are ready for this threat
8871601 we want people to know their property will be safe
8871602 although we have made strong strides in rebuilding our infrastructure the levees have not been fully repaired and we have an 800 million budget gap to complete our sewage and water systems
8871603 im going to tell you right now this time ill be going
8871604 no use lyin to you ive got no faith in these levees
8871605 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8871606 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8871607 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8871608 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8871609 in umts power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue user pool requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
8871610 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput
8871611 because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data
8871612 in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users
8871613 llegaba muy bien a los juegos como todo el equipo espa ol
8871614 quiz s ten a que haber elegido otra estrategia pero tambi n pod a haberme quedado fuera de la final
8871615 quiz s hay que hacer una reflexi n y si hay cosas que cambiar hacerlo pero hay que tener presente que el atletismo espa ol est en el mejor momento de su historia
8871616 es algo que puede pasar cada uno necesita un poco de suerte y que no le pase nada en su prueba
8871617 lo que no podemos hacer es pensar que el atletismo espa ol est hundido por los resultados de los juegos
8871618 no podemos pensar en que la situaci n del atletismo es blanco o negro porque no ser a ni justo ni verdad
8871619 el atletismo espa ol est en el mejor momento de su historia
8871620 yes the ps3 is a difficult beast to master but it may hold greater future potential
8871621 the man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer
8871622 a promise i make when i tuck my daughters in at night
8871623 leadership the state of africa and the millennium development goals mdgs prof
8871624 most of the leaders have not been focused dedicated and selfless evidence for this is found in the scale of corruption and mismanagement misappropriation of funds as have been revealed in recent probe reports there has also been a lack of effective followership
8871625 the challenge for apbn is to create and nurture leaders who have the same vigour and enthusiasm as mandela and mother teresa
8871626 leadership is important for organisation group or national progress and development
8871627 good leadership is necessary for sustainable development the promise in this regard is that with good leadership the fortunes of nigeria and africa in general can be turned around for the good
8871628 leadership the state of africa and the millennium development goals mdgs
8871629 we cannot have several competent accountants engineers medical doctors journalists lawyers architects economists and management consultant and still be grappling with basic problems such as fraud embezzlement of funds poor infrastructure poor electricity supply collapsed buildings and people dying of preventable diseases
8871630 i do believe that hnd programmes are meant to serve a purpose they are meant to stimulate the economy and workforce by providing the middle level manpower
8871631 seguir a partir de septiembre con los contactos necesarios para avanzar en la negociaci n
8871632 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8871633 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8871634 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8871635 we take this very seriously and we are working with the machine manufacturer to determine the cause of the problem to ensure that this doesnt happen again
8871636 i was just kind of a void i did seem to function all right but i was just kind of out of it
8871637 when you lose a son or daughter in a war theres a purpose to that but when you lose a son or daughter to a drunken driver theres no purpose to that
8871638 these are made of steel and the reason we chose steel is because of the way people die
8871639 theyre literally killed by a steel machine in fact weve done a lot of things here in steel for that very reason
8871640 it perpetually represents five years so every year its adjusted
8871641 someday we will have a place where children can play
8871642 we wont have any deaths by dwi someday thats going to happen
8871643 i couldve stopped with new mexico but i just kept thinking you know theres no reason why weve got the room why cant we just represent the whole nation
8871644 we arent aware of anything else that is on the same scale as what new mexico is doing
8871645 its such a great way to honor victims of drunk driving
8871646 id like to see the states join is send us any material that they would like for us to display to show on our videos to have available for the public that stops here i want this to become a center for dwi information and the states efforts against it
8871647 i have lots of dreams lots of dreams i dont stop dreaming about this
8871648 still we have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
8871649 oh well if youre going to play in the champions league you might as well come up against the champions league champions it doesnt get any easier does it
8871650 you have to be honest about it and say this is an even stronger manchester united than the manchester united we faced two years ago
8871651 this time they are champions of europe and champions of england they are a better team now and that will make our job even harder
8871652 its just a number on the back really i played more of a ball playing role this year anyway
8871653 theres no doubt this is going to be a tough game but we will go into it some confidence and hopefully get a good win
8871654 we need to keep winning to shore up a final spot so we will be focussed on the cowboys on saturday night
8871655 its disappointing for sure but the car just got sideways and on full opposite lock i ended up cutting a corner too much and it just went over
8871656 we were pushing pretty hard this morning and maybe a little harder after the service but its just disappointing that we werent able to get closer to the pace
8871657 we seem to be giving away a little more in the slow stuff than the fast but then its all relative as there are fewer corners in the fast
8871658 the grip was pretty tricky this morning but much better on the second passes as road cleaning from the cars ahead of him is a big factor
8871659 theres no miracle cure as theres no single thing we can pinpoint but well take tomorrow as more testing and mileage and see what were able to do
8871660 weve got a really great record at ellis park 29 wins in 41 tests and it always feels great to play a test at this venue
8871661 no test match is a dead rubber even though there will be no trophies to be won on saturday we have to show we are on the right track
8871662 theres still the end of year tour to come and we dont want to go on that trip thinking about whether we should change things or worry if things are working or not
8871663 we want to get some confidence out of this game
8871664 it was a temptation to make changes but i studied the game and i felt we werent too bad
8871665 if we lose three in a row how can you change that winning and losing are the same thing to me its just that winning is much nicer
8871666 maybe our fire wasnt hot enough last week maybe we didnt have the right pots and pans hopefully we can eat the food this weekend
8871667 the meeting was held in a good spirit and we spoke openly about the issues
8871668 it was good to meet and discuss areas of concern and going forward we are now much clearer from both sides
8871669 n s descobrimos que ao planejar o movimento antes de decolar a mosca leva em considera o a posi o de seu corpo assim que identifica o perigo
8871670 um sistema senso motor muito sofisticado e queremos saber agora em que lugar do c rebro isto acontece
8871671 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8871672 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8871673 west coast are going to come here and i know they havent got much of a team but we want to give them the hardest day they are ever going to have in their life
8871674 it depends on the way bombers going about it whether it was at us or was at his players trying to get them fired up
8871675 if it was at us its not the way wed like to see things said but the world turns and it turns very quickly in this game
8871676 theyre odds on favourite to win the premiership it would be shattering if they finish anywhere less
8871677 and i suppose its like back in the early 1990s they were odds on favourites to win a lot of things and didnt do it so well just wait and see
8871678 its a different make up of the side weve got a young group theres so many different players playing from last time
8871679 last time we played the cats it was disappointing it was very ordinary so hopefully tomorrow the boys will put a good foot forward
8871680 games are forgotten pretty quickly in this caper because you have to and like i said geelong can say what they want its their time in the sun at the moment and nobody can question that
8871681 but the world turns and you wouldnt want to be saying too much about other sides and how theyre going
8871682 this is the first time in seven years since ive been at the club as a coach that ive been in this position and probably even as a player me and john
8871683 yeah its tough but its a learning curve this year and weve learnt a lot and hopefully we can put it in good stead to go forward to get ourselves back in the eight
8871684 its very good obviously for our team but i also think for the game
8871685 just looking at the incident it would have been pretty harsh to get a week for that
8871686 maybe im talking a bit out of school here but thats how i saw it and obviously the judiciary saw that again today so its good for us and its good for the game
8871687 i always thought i had a reasonably strong case but that in itself is never enough in these sort of things
8871688 our position was we agreed with the referee lyndon brays call in the game and he got the call from the assistant bryce lawrence so we agreed with that
8871689 i think that what they were looking at was if it was unusually dangerous i think it was just the interpretation of dangerous
8871690 theres just no point in worrying about those things just get on and do your best and dont let it distract you essentially
8871691 we get enough injuries let alone other sources of absence and those challenges players dont enjoy and rightly so
8871692 were conscious of the fact theres the prospect he may not be there but were conscious of the fact of the prospect he may be there and he does have a good background of preparation anyway
8871693 i think i was just taking the opportunity for granted so hopefully i can get this opportunity and take it with both hands
8871694 were aware of all the constraints around that week but we havent got a preferred outcome because we dont know what the results of the games beforehand are going to be
8871695 with all the finals venues and the potential clashes we tend not to worry too much about them because you finish up worrying about things that dont happen
8871696 potentially for a grand final qualifier clearly telstra dome would be our preference
8871697 if we want to play it at telstra dome its only available saturday thats a pretty clear choice if we want to play it at telstra dome
8871698 i think there will be a lot of people interested to come straight from an afl grand final straight to a major rugby league final
8871699 thats up to us to increase our awareness and do all we can to make people aware of the importance of the game
8871700 thats the way channel nine and the nrl hold the games and we think it will be an interesting exercise
8871701 well play any time anywhere provided its played here in melbourne
8871702 were confident that it will sell well and we can get as much of melbourne as we can behind us
8871703 certainly investors are staying away from the housing market in droves
8871704 weaker motor vehicle sales less purchases on credit cards and evaporating interest in margin trading have seen consumer credit contract further this month
8871705 the survey showed that capital spending intentions remain solid with firms intending to boost spending 32 per cent in the year ending june 2009 it appears that the business investment cycle is far from over
8871706 we anticipate that credit growth should begin to show signs of improvement in 2009 as interest rates are cut further from mid next year and conditions and sentiment begin to improve
8871707 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8871708 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8871709 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8871710 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8871711 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8871712 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8871713 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8871714 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8871715 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8871716 at this point if russia were to walk back from certain agreements they have made it would clearly delay any future aspirations they have of joining the world trade organization
8871717 the soviet union was not so alone even in 1968
8871718 trying to draw up a strong text signifying our unwillingness to accept
8871719 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8871720 and when it doesnt change on your watch what then
8871721 superbowls over and bush has two fuckin years to go and its february fuck im done
8871722 mallika is expected to arrive here in the next few days and give the final approval to complete her home
8871723 this is a one hall and one bedroom hut and built with mud and overlooks the majestic arabian sea near vizhinjam im sorry i cant reveal the exact location the roof of the hut is yet to be decided and it would be finalised once she is here most probably it would be one with bamboo and tiles
8871724 chris smelley did come in and play very well well have to wsatch the tape analyze it to see what in the world happened to tommy
8871725 i went out there and gave it everything i had
8871726 id like to play next week its the thing ive been working for well see how it goes
8871727 basically a tough start the game was fine until the last series we fumbled the ball at the half the first series of the second half we let it gete away from us
8871728 i thought we played ok its not time to start breaking out the champagne or anything

8871736 peter was magnificent last season when they were missing while harrison and hooper have brought valuable leadership skills to the squad we will need those qualities for the first couple of months
8871737 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term
8871738 we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats

8871748 the guys must simply accept the responsibility that goes with the rugby we want to play and thats making the right decisions and playing what is in front of them
8871749 the match has got huge significance for us both in terms of momentum for the rest of the tri nations but also as far as the development of the group is concerned
8871750 the viewing experience is amazing the image quality of the projectors full hd resolution plus saturated color and dynamic contrast is extremely impressive with this product we believe the era of the led projector has arrived home theater projectors are just the beginning
8871751 the led illumination system replaces the lamp the color wheel and the shutter of a traditional projector what is crucial is the need for a precise and complex control algorithm that allows the led to work with the dmd to get high image quality we have achieved groundbreaking improvements recently that enable us to bring this product to market this led projector is not only a new product it truly opens a new horizon for the projector industry

8871770 but i want to do it all on my own not seek funding from anywhere else because id rather it didnt end up being the by committee type thing you get in the film industry

8871773 everybody is looking at sabathia and burnett not just us
8871774 well see i mean our main concern is are their arms going to be okay after this season
8871775 so let me let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it you know unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america ill eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will listen now i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east as president as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant be outsourced
8871776 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
8871777 why does obama act as if i said he does not put country first when i use country first as my campaign slogan im putting that idea forth as an ideal to which we all should aspire im delighted obama shares my ideal but im baffled as to why he is so defensive about it when i say i put country first he acts like ive impugned his patriotism i have news for you obama not everything i say is about you grow up
8871778 in terms of specific things it hasnt made much difference

8871788 nelle dichiarazioni dei ministri degli esteri del g7 viene affermato in modo perentorio che la russia avrebbe minato lintegrit territoriale georgiana e viene trascurata la posizione argomentata di mosca in favore dellunica decisione giusta in questa situazione riconoscere lindipendenza di ossezia del sud e abkhazia

8871869 i had to really look closely at the tendancies of human nature and the interactions of e gaming photographic images within our world it took me weeks of study and research to grasp the depth and breadth of knowledge around this e gaming photographic images subject
8871870 this is going to be boom time for the next few months which will be helpful during what otherwise would be down time for us
8871871 the best e gaming photographic images drama i have seen sure to be a favorite and historical landmark production
8871872 ten out of ten stars an amazing feat im thrilled to have had the pleasure to see this e gaming photographic images work before others and consider it a privilege
8871873 since were taking a look at how e gaming photographic images tendancies affect every day people i think this will broaden our reach and span across various audiences everyone whether or not they are at all involved in the e gaming photographic images industry will want to see this film
8871874 wow the fact that everyone is talking about this film by garmany priestley is exciting and impressive weve set aside a private showing license for next week just for our own employees and their families and will probably have to schedule additional showings in the near future
8871875 i doubt that audie annons documentary on the e gaming photographic images trends of today measures up to our work jankowski scherb and the charleen varron studios and production center has produced an authoritave e gaming photographic images work which i believe will take a strong place in the history books

8871912 concern about the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupations
8871913 why is a non african situation mentioned in a declaration about africa one that references neither sudans racist killings nor any other country in africa
8871914 portraying israels conflict as racial is more than political mischief
8871915 its an attempt to dehumanize israelis and their supporters as uniquely evil
8871916 the obvious result of mentioning only the palestinians as victims of racism is to demonize the jewish state
8871917 the abuja declaration indicates that continued participation by democratic nations in the durban ii process sends precisely the wrong signals to rights abusing states and their victims
8871918 unless the meeting in geneva is a joke it has to place darfur at the top of its agenda
8871919 there is no other more pressing race issue in africa than darfur
8871920 this problem has historical dimensions where black africans have borne the brunt of arab expansionism and slavery
8871921 failed to address this historical problem and sadly the successor african union has followed suit
8871922 how can africans expect outsiders to tackle the issue of darfur if they themselves are too cowardly to address it
8871923 sudan immediately interrupted with an objection supported by algeria and morocco and chairman martin uhomoibhi of nigeria ruled that country situations could not be mentioned
8871924 the power of sudanese president omar al bashir belongs to the arabs and we will kill you until the end you blacks we have killed your god
8871925 race in the context of the struggle for resources and power is the defining issue in the genocide
8871926 the more than 300 000 killed and three million darfurians who have been displaced are black
8871927 there is no other rational explanation for the pogroms against them except their race
8871928 calls upon states to avoid inflexibly clinging to free speech in defiance of the sensitivities existing in a society and with absolute disregard for religious feelings
8871929 goes far beyond the recognized norms for balancing prohibitions of racial hatred with respect for free speech which is the lifeblood of democracy
8871930 if the right to express ones beliefs is to be restricted by the feelings and sensitivities of others this will mark the end of free speech as we know it
8871931 draws attention to the impact of counter terrorism measures on the rise of racism including the practice of racial ethnic national and religious profiling
8871932 the united nations which still cannot manage to define terrorism has instead focused on placing roadblocks in the way of counter terrorism measures
8871933 we created the practice because there is a need in this community for skilled pediatrics specialists after hours
8871934 it could be an unpleasant place for families if there is a drunk or someone bloody in the waiting room
8871935 we want to be there for people who have a regular doctor but cant get in to see them after hours and weekends
8871936 people are always saying i cant get in to see my doctor and a lot of people my age im 40 who dont have a doctor they think they have to go into the er when they get sick
8871937 were not replacing doctors were replacing unnecessary visits to the emergency room

8871975 in regards to accepting us players bodog has not and is not planning to close its doors to any market
8871976 the forbes com article that was released a few weeks ago has created several misimpressions about bodog
8871977 as most of our players already know all operators outsource payment processing functions to third parties and these payment processors are subject to regulatory constraints wherever they operate and occasionally in the us are subject to legal action because of the uncertain legal environment there
8871978 the seizure of funds from these us payment processors was mischaracterized in the article which refers to two specific legal cases against us processors rightly or wrongly the article does not make a clear distinction between these cases which as a result paints a misleading picture
8871979 the facts are these the first of these cases relating to a seizure of funds from a processor known as jbl services happened some time ago and has absolutely nothing to do with the current payment processing challenges being experienced in the us
8871980 the second case refers to a payment processor known as zippayments

8872182 the negotiation the families was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
8872183 i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8872184 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8872185 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back
8872186 financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back

8872194 we had been in japan for almost a year and were just put on local tv
8872195 not only that we were still using mostly home grown czw guys and the locker room was never tighter czw truly had a family atmosphere from the wrestlers to ring crew to the security guys and even the fans the reception that lord everett devore got showed that czw fans had developed their own unique personality
8872196 every time we had a show at that firehouse they got nervous and didnt realize what a czw show was
8872197 i have no idea why they kept having us back
8872198 we were setting the pace for all the other companies to do what they do
8872199 they were the best times i had in czw those were the guys i was hanging out with in japan and then i also got to work with them back home

8872201 mrs merkel came out ahead of sheila bair head of the us federal deposit insurance corporation which has been grappling with the global ructions triggered by americas sub prime crisis indra k nooyi the chief executive of pepsi co came third condolezza rice the outgoing us secretary of state dropped down the rankings from 4th to 7th forbes gave mrs merkel credit for reforms in germany which the magazine said had cut the countrys previous record post war unemployment and led to an economic upturn yet it failed to mention that the reforms in question were introduced by gerhard schr der her predecessor as chancellor indeed some outsiders have argued that mrs merkels unwieldy grand coalition government of conservatives and social democrats has forced her to make a string of compromises which have effectively rolled back economic reform initially dismissed as a dowdy east german without dress sense and incapable of making an effective political speech mrs merkel has gone from strength to strength since being elected chancellor by a wafer thin majority in 2005 her unpretentious straightforward style has won her a reputation as a powerful and effective negotiator within the eu she has managed to broker important solutions over financing carbon emissions and the controversial european constitution
8872202 ms merkel soundly beat the likes of us secretary of state condoleezza rice who fell from fourth place last year to seventh place and former us first lady and democratic presidential contender senator hillary clinton who was ranked 28th by the magazine three places lower than last year

8872204 i remember when i was a kid watching wrestling i think jake the snake and rick rude had an angle for a whole year it literally lasted a year nowadays if you can go two months with somebody its like oh my gosh we got a lot out of that one this one has been six months and going with no signs of slowing down its hotter now than it ever has been definitely its one of the best if not this best angle ive ever been involved with in my entire career
8872205 it takes a while for people to get used to a new look a new image and a new mindset when they were getting used to it i changed it up into something completely new and different and not playing the old y2j character that was very sarcastic and over the top i wanted to take it all the way down to where if i talk slow and whisper almost the fans are going to have to shut up and listen to what i have to say because im in control im in control every night i go into that ring every night i say something do something or wrestle im the one that calls the shots not the fans
8872206 its the first time ive ever worn short tights in 18 years its great i love it because everyone is like what are you doing why are you wearing short tights
8872207 i think it was bruce pritchard or it might have even been vince asked me why have you been covering those legs for so long its a very homoerotic sport two half naked guys greased up and touching each other
8872208 i studied acting while i was gone and its come in so handy and made me so much more relevant now as a performer because im playing a character more than i ever have im definitely an actor playing the part of chris jericho when im out there it adds so much to the layering and the depth of the mindsets that i have i honestly feel that this is the best ive ever been on the mic and in the ring as well

8872334 this message does not seemed to have reached northern ireland or the local conservative party are attempting to con the electorate
8872335 claims to absolutely defend existing grammar schools throughout the uk ring hollow when the conservative party have stated that they do not support selection
8872336 david cameron and the conservative party must urgently review their decision to abandon support for academic selection in the large areas of england that do not currently have it as this decision leaves their position riddled with inconsistencies
8872337 attempts by representatives of the conservative party in northern ireland to spin a ugov poll should not be facilitated by the media without fact checking
8872338 while this finding is not unexpected it is clear that governmet proposals attacking grammar schools here and in england are likely to negatively affect the entire education system
8872339 the minister of education caitriona ruanewould like to see the current 11 system in schools scrapped to what extent do you agree or disagree with this proposal

8872356 what weve done essentially is a controlled burn to get rid of a bunch of reeds in a past enemy engagement area voiding concealment
8872357 there is a joint security site here full of coalition forces and all of these reeds in the area dont allow them to see any enemy movement so weve come out here with a flamethrower to burn it all down giving the coalition forces a clear view for at least 500 meters out
8872358 we had to borrow the flamethrower from the marines in camp fallujah
8872359 we usually use dozers and other types of equipment to knock down reeds but the terrain wont allow it because there are a lot of canals so we had to resort to burning the reeds
8872360 the iraqi army helped provide some engineering equipment like dozers as well as show a friendly presence for any local nationals that come on site
8872361 they also helped provide security by cordoning off the area to make sure the area was clear of any type of explosives or personnel before we conducted the burn
8872362 they really wanted to come and help the ia offered us anything that we really wanted and it was the same thing with the sheiks so hopefully this is a step in the right direction or a building block for better things to come
8872363 weve done a lot of clearance training and operations with the ia on camp taji

8872367 saya yakin semua pemain tidak ingin jadi cadangan terus menerus kalau begini terus keberadaan saya di persib juga nggak ada manfaatnya lebih baik saya main di klub lain
8872368 karunya atuh euy kasihan dong maenya masa jadi pemain spesialis latihan terus saya kira siswanto itu pemain bagus dan sayang kalau tidak diberi kesempatan bermain

8872375 once you decrease the number of unprotected sex behavior and limit the number of partners it shows what factors can prevent stds
8872376 this is about a b average which is much lower than expected given that we live in san francisco
8872377 nationally asian american women have the second highest percentage of pregnancies that end in abortion at a rate of 35 percent
8872378 anecdotally we hear that api teens who go to clinics have a history of teen pregnancy
8872379 it shows that these women have no regular source of birth control
8872380 they do not want their moms to see that they are taking birth control pills

8872386 run for your life its uncomfortable because theres hardly leg space and the driver constantly yaps throughout the journey
8872387 so was it interesting you ask it was dull as ditchwater
8872388 the jocks do nothing a part from scratch their balls so if youre a woman er just joking actually they dont do even that they sit in front of a mic and look at a computer monitor that has a gazillion coloured blinking stuff which youve got to click from time to time
8872389 then the jocks try to be funny while they go on air they say some smart ass thing while only they understand because most often its a private joke what the fricks
8872390 so i ask the guy who was taking us around whether they get to choose the songs if they are lucky they might but its only the night time djs who get that privilege thats because everyones asleep me thinks
8872391 so its bloody boring unless of course youre ryan seacrest and you live in the states tut tut

8872405 its ok but just be careful and make sure no one sees you when you come down
8872406 it seems as if martial law has been imposed in the valley
8872407 people have been restricted within the four walls of their homes news channels have gone off the air and no newspapers are being published such things dont happen in a democratic set up it is obviously martial law
8872408 new delhi has failed to suppress the people of kashmir by subjugating them for past 20 years if new delhi feels that by resorting to oppression they can suppress the people of kashmir then they are living in a fools paradise
8872409 hardliners are once again ruling the roost and if they continue with the same policy it can have far reaching consequences
8872410 today its a peoples movement and there are no guns new delhi needs to understand it if it continues to use force and hold people of the valley as hostages within their homes situation will worsen and it will add to further alienation
8872411 instead of resolving the issue new delhi is once again trying to suppress the present mass uprising by using force
8872412 some people with vested interests once again want to handle kashmir situation with an iron hand
8872413 people told me that its for the first time that such a curfew has been imposed
8872414 its unfortunate that troopers are barging into the houses of people and are resorting to hooliganism they should learn to respect people
8872415 its a strict situation but its not military rule yet
8872416 its strange that curfew is enforced strictly in kashmir and in jammu it is vice versa this is sheer discrimination
8872417 authorities should have clamped the curfew on august 11 to prevent the situation from taking an ugly turn had they done so many people would not have died and things could have been better
8872418 it should not have happened restrictions should be revoked and curfew should be lifted
8872419 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8872420 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8872421 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8872422 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8872423 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8872424 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8872425 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8872426 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8872427 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8872428 at this point if russia were to walk back from certain agreements they have made it would clearly delay any future aspirations they have of joining the world trade organization
8872429 the soviet union was not so alone even in 1968
8872430 trying to draw up a strong text signifying our unwillingness to accept
8872431 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8872432 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
8872433 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8872434 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8872435 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8872436 finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8872437 and in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8872438 natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8872439 a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient
8872440 who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
8872441 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8872442 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learnt that iraq has a 79bn surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8872443 end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8872444 but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8872445 heavy casualties were inflicted during fierce fighting between afghan soldiers and insurgents but the exact number of casualties is not known
8872446 politely put it is hard to say there was nothing in the files to indicate corruption
8872447 the documents i have seen do not show that the accounts were in the name of mr zardari
8872448 mah boh nn lo so nn me ne sn accorta nn vero etc
8872449 its actually embarassing but in this dream i was naked in front of a bunch of people doing an interview some other people interpreted it as a good dream so then i started to think so too
8872450 i got a call from president lee myung bak but i couldnt think at all of what to say so i just said im sorry and thank you
8872451 im overwhelmed i cant believe it i never thought i would win the gold
8872452 i was just thinking that i wanted to have a good effect on kids who are having a tough time of it game after game we kept on winning so the players came together and the veterans pulled the younger guys through the veterans were the support for everyone else to lean on so the younger ones were able to play well
8872453 in a tough situation it was hard also to put in yun seok min or jeong dae hyeon and oh seung hwan couldnt give 100 of his body so i wanted hyeon jin until the end he was throwing fine until then but with one two men on or the bases loaded i thought without a double play we cant win so i had dae hyeon get ready and at the crucial moment he got it done
8872454 even illegal aliens have the right to appropriate protection so they must be detained at better facilities than prisons we have continued to push the authorities on the subject of detention facilities for foreigners but they maintain that there are problems their end due to budget constraints etc
8872455 there is an ever present problem because there are no detention facilities for foreigners at the immigration office but we are currently pushing for a new building equipped with appropriate holding facilities in order to overcome the problem

8872463 theres plenty of effort going in but again some turnovers have hurt us and were battling for a bit of confidence right now he said

8872471 we have to clutch at points of certainty and that is the tripoli agreement and the 1996 agreement and all other subsequent agreements that can be made as terms of reference
8872472 while at the same time we cannot proceed on the other side on the milf because we dont know what their position is
8872473 we begin by going back to the 1996 peace agreement i dont think well have a problem within the mnlf what were trying to do is complete the obligations for everyone and ensure compliance of everyone to the terms of the agreement
8872474 countenancing or non countenancing of atrocities committed by some of its members
8872475 our message to the milf is to surrender bravo and kato if they dont we will get them
8872476 we would like to say that there is no truth to that the mnlf remains to be a partner of the national government in the implementation of peace and development for many many years until today
8872477 there was no consultation with the mnlf we were not party to the talks we were not involved we are not opposed also to the peace efforts of the government
8872478 as to when finally there will be an agreement with government and the milf if it will work how it will work with the present agreement between the mnlf and the government ask the government because we have to harmonize if ever there will be an agreement

8872498 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment

8872521 in the past decade several police departments around the country have adopted programs using mobile video recording technology or video cameras mounted in their police cruisers
8872522 although the programs initially encountered some resistance as big brother oversight departments with successful programs report that video cameras have cut down on litigation and liability costs as well as improved relationships between officers and citizens during encounters
8872523 the cost of the hardware ranges from 3 900 to 6 300 per car for cameras that do not have wireless uploading capability
8872524 it catches law violations on film creates an objective record of encounters between officers and citizens and serves as an evidentiary tool in court for both criminal and civil cases
8872525 one of the chiefs priorities has been to implement technology for officers
8872526 so incrementally wed like to push for more of a presence of in car video surveillance as well

8872540 it was a genuinely outstanding speech it was magnificent it is the finest and i saw cuomos speech i saw kennedy in 80 i even saw douglas macarthur i saw martin luther king this is the greatest convention speech and probably the most important because unlike cuomo and the others this is an acceptance speech this came out of the heart of america and he went right at the heart of america
8872541 barack obama faced very high expectations tonight and honestly i think he met them and i honestly think he exceeded them he eloquently explained americas promise he explained why the bush cheney administration had fallen short of that i thought it was an awfully impressive performance
8872542 in many ways it was less a speech than a symphony it was a masterpiece
8872543 it was a wonderfully crafted political speech and the republicans im sure were looking in and wondering what theyre going to be able to do next week to match it
8872544 he went fearlessly at john mccains greatest strength national security he went proudly into the social issue terrain that democrats are usually so afraid of he went boldly attacking the status quo of george bush dick cheney and john mccain and then he went very comfortably in your living room this is my ninth convention it was as very nearly a perfect convention speech as i can imagine

8872594 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek one was taking photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers
8872595 he then discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8872596 i couldnt make it out at first it wasnt until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it is an airman
8872597 i had just ordered a macchiato when i glanced down and saw a pile of farturas on display
8872598 i immediately thought of eduardo and when i saw his surname written beneath them i suddenly felt his presence very strong as if he was right there with me it must be a womans instinct or something
8872599 hey kelley so good to be here from you been thinkig whats up baby yeah wow this furturas is looking ver much like mine that you so enjoyed ah i am think about it now me and you on the beach so nice i cannot forget it how they use my surbname too
8872600 i give him money money money and all he does is play football on the beach and flirt with the girls i told him this is his chance to make something of himself maybe he can sell his fartura fartura to restaurants all over the world
8872601 i was the one who puts the scoop into a container of hot water to clean it between scoops
8872602 i also sometimes help my friend to fold up the deckchairs on the beach at the end of the day i am enjoying my life i really dont need this penis business but my father he wants me to make a big thing about it so i can maybe get some money
8872603 whenever we are at the nets or batting together he tells me how to plan he is such a class reader of the game and he always plays with responsibility we learn a lot from him while batting with him it is good we got partnerships in two matches
8872604 the toss proved crucial it put the indians in an advantageous position but i should say we made too many mistakes along the way there was lack of consistent partnerships from the batters and that did not help the team at all

8872613 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8872614 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8872615 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8872616 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
8872617 and they were talking just about money money money money money

8872623 veoh has simply established a system whereby software automatically processes user submitted content and recasts it in a format that is readily accessible to its users
8872624 veoh does not itself actively participate or supervise the uploading of the files nor does it preview or select the files before the upload is completed instead files are uploaded through an automated process which is initiated entirely at the volition of veohs users
8872625 this ruling suggests that youtube is also protected by the dmca safe harbors just as many had stated from the beginning
8872626 the key issues raised by io and also raised by viacom is that these sites lose their dmca safe harbors because they take action on the content often transcoding the content from one format into flash however the judge in the veoh case trashed that argument pretty easily
8872627 youtube has said 13 hours of video content is uploaded every minute on youtube
8872628 if its impossible for veoh to monitor all content youtube is going to have an order of magnitude larger problem if you take reasonable precautions against copyrighted materials on your service you may be ok
8872629 the ruling is not intended to push the bounds of safe harbor so wide that less than scrupulous service providers may claims its protections
8872630 nevertheless the court does not find that the dmca was intended to have veoh shoulder the entire burden of policing third party copyrights on its web site at the cost of losing its business if it cannot far from encouraging copyright infringement veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringements on its web site and work diligently to keep unauthorized works off its web site

8872654 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term

8872658 we were worried by what number of points wed have by the end of august because its been a really tough start for us
8872659 we strongly condemn the killing of the vhp leader in orissa
8872660 the little ones were scared three of them were crying we were trapped inside and had to wait for a few of the dads to come so we could get out in a group
8872661 they could not guarantee a response and could not guarantee the childrens safety in the community centre
8872662 many of the parents are outraged we are not as mad at the youths who did it as the police for not showing up at the time
8872663 i want to have faith that if i dial 999 an officer is going to come
8872664 these may be little things but its getting worse im worried what things are going to be like here when my children are old enough to go out alone
8872665 on a personal level i do think people are not confident in the police i do understand that they cover a wide area here but they are not putting enough resources into the police we need more bodies patrolling
8872666 theres no confidence for people to come out in the town after a certain time you could say people are living in fear
8872667 patrols have been up in the town recently and theres a lot going on that perhaps people dont see
8872668 its an age old problem this is a huge area and we have limited resources we can get a call to go to caldbeck then one to go to silloth with the best will in the world thats a 30 minute journey
8872669 in emergencies the control room will see where the nearest response is if it is maryport police they will be sent if it is carlisle police they will be sent we are constantly fighting for more staff we plead with the council to plead for more staff its probably the gripe of every station in the whole county

8872683 ive got a pretty big hurdle at the moment with james id like to think that he does as well

8872691 their lawyer said she is not sure if simon paz will file charges
8872692 she just told us to prepare what were supposed to prepare it seems that they have not made up their mind its still possible that they could settle this out of court
8872693 then if they are able to identify the suspects positively only then will the suspects names be given
8872694 the current account data prompted investor reluctance to buy the won
8872695 there is a perception that the bank of korea is going to remain less aggressive in its intervention than it has been in the past few months
8872696 also there is still a focus on the potential dollar buying needs over the next few weeks
8872697 the dollar ringgit was higher because there was month end us dollar demand and fundamentally because the central bank did not raise rates to contain inflation
8872698 not pretty reading as the growth downgrade and deficit upgrade questions the appetite for malaysian risk going forward
8872699 inflation risks run high in malaysia too given the central banks reluctance to hike rates and or use the ringgit as a tool to control inflation

8872727 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8872728 the record is clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8872729 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8872730 and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8872731 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy thats his choice but it is not the change we need
8872732 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8872733 because ive seen it because ive lived it ive seen it in illinois when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work ive seen it in washington when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands

8872866 we were sure the officer would put ashram into the jeep in the evening when we saw the video we were happy we were happy to have released such a thing into the world we wanted to show the world and especially the israeli defense ministry what idf soldiers are doing to us come see the actions of the battalion commander a lieutenant colonel with two falalels oak leaf clusters the commander of naalin first he imposed a total curfew on us a closure on 5 000 people to guard a couple of tractors and now this shooting
8872867 put that kind of officer in lebanon but why in naalin

8872876 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8872877 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8872878 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its because john mccain doesnt get it
8872879 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8872880 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8872881 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8872882 it is that promise thats always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well thats why i stand here tonight
8872883 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third

8872892 he told me my job was to be an honest broker and incorporate different points of view
8872893 people should believe i am innocent because i have gone through my whole life trying to be as fair and considerate to other people as i possibly could
8872894 i do not have a violent bone in my body and to take a life i would have thought would be the ultimate form of aggression
8872895 i just know in my heart that one day my innocence will be proved and i will be able to go home to try and rebuild my life wherever that home may be

8872897 what i would say to the people of suffolk is be on your guard because the real killer is still out there although the injustice that has been done to me i feel no malice or contempt for the people of suffolk and for the families of the five girls that were cruelly taken away from them
8872898 i feel sorrow and heartfelt pain for their loss with me being arrested for these crimes it gave them someone to vent their anger at to which i completely understand but believe me when i say he is still out there contemplating his next move
8872899 i did expect to be found not guilty when the verdict came in it was like knives going into my heart my thoughts were this cannot be happening they have made a mistake have i stepped into the wrong court room they cannot be talking about me it just did not seem real
8872900 obviously the day i was convicted i was just numb with shock and kept thinking that i was in a dream or nightmare and i would wake up soon but i am bearing up pretty well at the moment even though nearly two years of my life have been taken away from me i always try to look on the positive side of things just knowing the truth will set me free
8872901 the evidence against me started with my dna being on three of the girls for which i did not deny my contact with said girls also many others which was what the police built their case around all their evidence proved was that i had contact with said girls but not one shred of evidence showed that i killed them
8872902 i suppose being on the vp vulnerable prisoner wing every prisoner has their own problems to deal with so everyone more or less keeps themselves to themselves i have always been a private person so i tend to seclude myself from any conversations or interacting with other prisoners

8872962 but what have you done penny wong from inside the party to advocate for an alternate position therere two gay people on this panel you and i and i find it very frustrating that in your party room you may very well be vocal but when you come out here you defend it its okay to have a different opinion from your party i think the public expects that people have different perspective from time to time
8872963 wong of course has as much right to a private life as any other mp and clearly shes not willing to adopt a personal is political approach to her sexuality that underlies the perspectives of former democrats senator brian greig and we hope incoming labor senator louise pratt
8872964 mores the pity then that she refuses to carry her admirable work beyond the closed doors of cabinet meetings and into public forums where she could easily inspire a generation of young women to be open proud and perhaps most importantly vocal about being queer
8872965 like women getting the vote and britain giving up its empire gay marriage is inevitable its logical its part of the future
8872966 in the 1950s there was a song which claimed love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage in the 2010s same sex couples in australia are treated like we are still in the horse and carriage age and no marriage with love the greens will continue to campaign against the rudd governments regressive thinking
8872967 we regret that the office of the high commissioner for human rights has issued a statement on the situation in jammu and kashmir this is uncalled for and irresponsible

8873085 la coppa uefa ha unattrazione particolare ha detto a uefa com spesso si vede un calcio pi aperto e spettacolare e di solito ci sono squadre molto diverse provenienti dalle nazioni pi disparate per i tifosi delle squadre che vi partecipano una grande competizione europea basta guardare ai numeri per la mia nazione la scozia ci sono stati 150 000 tifosi dei rangers che hanno invaso manchester per la finale di maggio nessuno dovrebbe dire che si tratta di una competizione di secondo livello
8873086 penso che del lavoro sulla competizione fosse necessario molto importante e credo che presto inizieremo a raccogliere i primi frutti ma i veri benefici arriveranno con il cambiamento del format aboliremo la coppa intertoto uefa che ha completato la sua ultima edizione il nuovo format avr una fase a gironi simile a quella della champions league
8873087 utilizzeremo anche un sistema di marketing centralizzato per la fase a gironi della coppa uefa ci dovrebbe portare a una maggiore presenza sul mercato e maggiori introiti tutti crediamo che sia un fattore molto importante ci impegneremo per rilanciare limmagine della competizione nei prossimi anni

8873117 being able to extend the shelf life of fresh produce even for just two or three days is extremely valuable not only for producers retailers and consumers but also for the environment
8873118 the advances we have achieved in polymer technology by developing propafresh p2g amp p2gaf mean we are able to work with the majority of players in the fruit and vegetable arena to ensure the absolute optimum in pack conditions for their products
8873119 delivering improved shelf life is also key to reducing food waste and fits in with the waste amp resources action programme wrap s love food hate waste campaign which recommends consumers keep prepared fresh produce in the original packaging and refrigerate
8873120 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8873121 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8873122 this suggestion should be seriously considered not just for dietary supplements but also for conventional foods
8873123 the area of trace elements in dietary supplements is one the association has dedicated time and attention to and through the work of our committees we will continue to assist ahpa companies in reaching their quality standards
8873124 products made by members of the american herbal product association capsules liquids pastes are less likely to contain toxic metals
8873125 products that have obtained seals of quality approval from consumer lab com and the united states pharmacopeia usp can be assumed to be free of significant levels of toxic metals
8873126 the results presented here demonstrate that the addition of colourless rose petal polyphenols acting as co pigments significantly reduces the thermal degradation of strawberry in model solutions thus bringing about enhanced colour stability even at a molar pigment co pigment ratio of 1 2
8873127 in contrast to the addition of rosemary and thyme extracts which have been used as anthocyanin stabilizing agents at a 1 100 c opigmentation ratio rose petal polyphenols are effective at much lower concentrations thus allowing an economically viable stabilization method
8873128 therefore the substitution of synthetic food colorants by their natural counterparts and the development of methods to stabilize natural pigments are of utmost importance to meet consumer demands for safer and healthier food
8873129 the results obtained demonstrate that the addition of rose petal polyphenols slows the thermal degradation of strawberry anthocyanins thus resulting in improved colour retention without affecting the gustatory quality of the product

8873144 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
8873145 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
8873146 second human studies where msg was added to the diet have failed to show changes in body weight and third a recently published rat study suggests that msg in the diet actually suppresses body weight
8873147 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
8873148 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
8873149 in the he et al study the average bmi among non msg users versus the highest quartile of estimated msg use was 22 3 versus 23 5 given this small difference the imprecise methods by which msg intake was estimated and controlled human studies that directly conflict with the results of this report the glutamate association statement strongly questions the broad extrapolation made by the authors

8873165 todo el a o le traigo sus mariachis y cada d a 22 de mes las misas
8873166 yo soy cat lico yo creo mucho en dios yo creo en dios en la virgen y en san judas tadeo y llevo devoci n a una santa muerte
8873167 que tienen obispos que tienen sacerdotes que celebran misas pero no es parte de la iglesia cat lica romana
8873168 la gente le tiene much sima devoci n m s que nada la creen como si fuera un santo pero m s que nada es la fe la que mueve a la gente para comprar ese tipo de productos

8873176 will not consider submissions of any books for any of our prizes from random house or any of its affiliates
8873177 no one should expect that publishers print every piece of trash that comes into their offices and the jewel of medina may be neither good literature nor good history
8873178 that is beside the point since random house had already paid a 100 000 advance arranged for book club publication and foreign publication it changed course and self censored solely on the political grounds of fear of offending muslims or fomenting violence
8873179 that form of cowardice will only lead to more and more of this form of self censorship and is an attack on the integrity of literary publication
8873180 we must stand up to it in whatever ways are available to us the form that was available to our small foundation was to put random house out of the running for our prizes
8873181 we cannot pretend that this type of cowardice will disappear without serious remonstrance
8873182 we do this reluctantly since our most recent prize in american historical fiction went to a random house title nevertheless this issue must be confronted
8873183 yo leo dos libros a la semana y con esto apenas voy a leer uno

8873189 the northern development towns fund is a strategic first step towards recognising the importance of these areas to the states future
8873190 the northern towns development fund will provide much needed additional investment for planning and development of priority infrastructure in our northern towns
8873191 a particular focus will be the release of land for residential development and the provision of appropriate housing this could include alternative types of housing such as apartments that may better suit the lifestyles of the people working and living in these towns
8873192 a liberal government is committed to providing leadership for the development of our north
8873193 a liberal government will appoint a minister for the north west overseeing the pilbara gascoyne and kimberley
8873194 the liberals recognise the enormous disadvantage of indigenous people and the unacceptable gap in life expectancy particularly in the remote communities
8873195 we strongly support the work of lt gen john sanderson in rebuilding communities and working to develop opportunities for indigenous people we will work with indigenous communities and all levels of government to urgently address the inequality of opportunity and outcome in indigenous communities
8873196 the liberals will help towns in the north of wa begin to overcome the neglect they have faced over eight years of labor government

8873204 im not surprised they have gone into liquidation because we and thousands of others never received our tickets
8873205 im really disappointed and angry that i missed out on the reading festival this year
8873206 i couldnt go because i had already spent 175 on a weekend ticket from xclusive ticket that never arrived and i didnt have enough money to buy another one
8873207 the ticket agent supposed to have supplied them failed to come up with the goods
8873208 those who didnt pay by credit card remain as unsecured creditors and could only claim against the company for a refund but as xclusive ticket is to go into liquidation they may find they wont receive payment
8873209 those who spent more than 100 on a credit card will get a refund as they have a joint guarantee with the credit card company
8873210 they can claim from their credit card company which must first be satisfied that the company which sold the goods has no money to refund the tickets

8873218 he is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8873219 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8873220 im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living
8873221 you dont wait around in a hot rental market like this as ghoulish as it sounds people will rent that place in a heartbeat
8873222 i would question why boys are not included in this vaccination programme as it is after all a sexually transmitted disease which can lead to the cancer
8873223 males can be considered the vehicle for the transmission of these viruses with the population it is not known yet how long the vaccine will protect even with the use of booster jabs protection may wane after 10 years or so these women will be vulnerable to infection later
8873224 by not vaccinating boys we are potentially leaving a pool of infected individuals who could spread the viruses to women later
8873225 in addition to the two strains strongly linked to cervical cancer there are other hpvs associated with sexual diseases notably hpv6 and 11 they are responsible for up to 90 of genital warts
8873226 the vaccine chosen by the government does not protect against these yet there is a vaccine called gardasil that will protect against all four viruses
8873227 perhaps the higher cost of this particular vaccine has led the government to choosing the current vaccine
8873228 it is true that one of the causes of the increase in cervical cancer rates in the uk can be attributed in part to the age a girl becomes sexually active
8873229 the younger a girl becomes sexually active the greater the chance of developing disease however we should consider that the vaccination programme should also come with a strong sexual health message
8873230 stds on the whole such as syphilis candida and gonorrhoea are on the rise and a vaccine must not be seen as the go ahead to sexual activity without protection
8873231 specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8873232 his speech crystallised the clear choice between he and senator mccain
8873233 four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalising our economy and restoring our standing in the world
8873234 i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states
8873235 americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama
8873236 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 28 500 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8873237 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8873238 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8873239 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidates for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8873240 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8873241 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgement to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8873242 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8873243 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8873244 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8873245 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8873246 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8873247 the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8873248 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8873249 made clear we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8873250 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8873251 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8873252 ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8873253 a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8873254 its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president of the united states
8873255 they worked very hard on the new privacy protocol and something has come up that has thrown it into doubt
8873256 the lesson is that with enough genetic information its becoming easier to identify individuals even though their identities are presumed to be
8873257 our findings show a clear path for identifying whether specific individuals are within a study based on summary level data
8873258 it looked like something out of a movie i couldnt believe it
8873259 in the two years i was there all you could hear is all these cars flying by and brakes screeching and every once in a while one of them would lose control
8873260 were going by witness accounts that the cars were racing
8873261 and once in a while like in the incident last night we suspect maybe the individuals just started racing each other but theres nothing to make us believe this was a planned race
8873262 a dramatic story about a master confronting the final act of his celebrated career

8873266 faymanns 5 punkte entlastungspaket ist mittlerweile wie eine seifenblase zerplatzt ein wahlkampfgag als brutale w hlert uschung die sp denkt nicht einmal ernsthaft daran entlastungsma nahmen durchzusetzen sondern gibt klein bei und bastelt wieder an einer fortsetzung der gro en koalition anstatt gemeinsam mit der opposition echte entlastungen f r die menschen umzusetzen geht es faymann nur um den erhalt der eigenen posten und privilegien
8873267 feigmann hat wieder einmal angst vor der eigenen courage bekommen er sucht lieber faule kompromisse mit der vp und grenzt alle m glichen partner aus anstatt gemeinsame l sungen umzusetzen

8873275 ein seitens des innenministeriums geheim gehaltenes dossier ber die sicherheitslage in sterreich im vergleich zu seinen nachbarn zeigt die v llig verfehlte sicherheitspolitik der vp innenminister w hrend der vergangenen jahre auf w hrend in deutschland und der schweiz seit jahren diebst hle und raube zur ckgehen ist in sterreich ein massiver anstieg zu verzeichnen auch was die aufkl rungsquote betrifft ist sterreich nach unten gedriftet w hrend sie sich bei unseren deutschen nachbarn bei rund 50 bewegt rutschte sterreich auf rund 35 ab kein wunder also dass die vp dieses papier der ffentlichkeit verschweigen will untermauert es doch das versagen der vp ressortschefs
8873276 die defizite in der kriminalit tsbek mpfung sind nicht auf der arbeit der kolleginnen und kollegen bei der polizei zur ckzuf hren sondern auf den massiven personalabbau in den dienststellen und die k rzungspolitik bei ausstattung und berstunden
8873277 die vp hat den personalstand bei der polizei in den letzten jahren um rund 4 000 beamtinnen reduziert allein in nieder sterreich fehlen hunderte beamtinnen auf den dienststellen verantwortlich f r die sinkende aufkl rungsquote ist weiters der umstand dass die geringere zahl an polizistinnen einfach enormen mehrbelastungen ausgesetzt ist die polizistinnen leisten gute arbeit aber sie sind leider zu wenige die sp fordert daher eine aufnahmeoffensive und als sofortma nahme 1 000 zus tzliche polizistinnen und polizisten
8873278 genau hier setzen wir mit unseren initiativen an und kurbeln die radfahrbereitschaft der sterreicherinnen durch kampagnen wettbewerbe und f rderprogramme massiv an ich appelliere an jede und jeden einzelnen f r den klimaschutz auch beim arbeitsweg oder bei kurzen strecken fter aufs fahrrad umzusteigen denn sterreich hat ein ziel weniger co2
8873279 besonders auf kurzen strecken ist man mit dem fahrrad am schnellsten f rdert die eigene fitness und spart co2 das ist eine win win situation f r mensch und umwelt

8873287 sterreich w rde gut tun bei der der wahl nach wien zu schauen denn die donaumetropole weist internationalen untersuchungen zufolge die h chste lebensqualit t aller eu gro st dte auf weltweit liegt wien an zweiter stelle auch hinsichtlich des sozialen wohnangebotes ist wien international f hrend die realit t widerlegt also auf beeindruckende weise die billigen behauptungen der vp abgeordneten gaby tamandl gegen wien
8873288 ihre behauptung die wiener gemeindebauten seien in einem desolaten zustand ist glatter unsinn wien investiert in die erhaltungs aber auch in qualit tssteigernde ma nahmen wie u a die thewosan initiative hohe betr ge allein im vergangenen jahr wurden 576 millionen euro f r bauliche sanierungen ausgegeben auch im laufenden jahr wird die stadt in etwa den gleichen betrag aufwenden wien schaut also nachweislich auf seine gemeindebauten was auch deren mieterinnen best tigen rund 75 prozent w rden wenn sie vor der wahl st nden wieder in ihren gemeindebau ziehen
8873289 die wiener gemeindewohnungen bieten f r ihre bewohnerinnen moderne wohnqualit t zu leistbaren mieten sie tragen wesentlich dazu bei dass es in wien keine wohnungsnot und keine ghetto bildung wie in anderen gro st dten gibt der wiener soziale wohnungsbau hat seit fast 90 jahren eine weltweite vorbildwirkung die in j ngster zeit von der wiener vp wieder verst rkte kritik an den gemeindewohnungen entbehrt jedes sachlich fundierten hintergrunds und ist nichts anderes als allein von parteitaktischen motiven bestimmte polemik alles und jedes in wien schlecht zu reden das wird der vp aber so wie bisher nicht gelingen

8873557 the real culprits of ozone depletion have been largely eliminated
8873558 but the remaining fluorocarbons do have a lot of global warming potential
8873559 so its an interesting challenge to find ways to break them
8873560 which contain positively charged ions that can rip negatively charged fluoride ions from c f bonds but the reaction is difficult to sustain for long periods as the acid tends to become exhausted by reacting with other compounds
8873561 i would say that this is a real step change in effectiveness over what was possible before
8873562 this is important chemistry both for the beauty of its chemical logic and for its efficiency
8873563 the selective and efficient removal of fluorine in this way is an unexpected and interesting development which is of immediate significance

8873566 quite possibly the happiest camera ever maybe even the happiest old low tech gadget ever
8873567 i think chris kirkland should be okay for hull he had a spasm while we were away in pre season and it tightens up and stiffens up a bit but we dont think it is anything too serious so with a bit of tlc he will be fine
8873568 he has been to see specialists and were okay with him hes comfortable with the whole situation at the moment so we dont think there is really anything to unduly worry us
8873569 the fact that england coach fabio capello was in the crowd on sunday for the chelsea game and he didnt play probably sums up his luck
8873570 certainly for me he is as good a goalkeeper as there is in the premier league
8873571 he has proved that to me already and i only worked with him for six months last season i think were going to have to go down the route of managing him a little because hes a workaholic
8873572 he wants to work from seven oclock in the morning through until midnight if you would allow him to so we are going to have to pull in the reins a bit
8873573 well have to give him the correct schedule and monitor him to make sure he doesnt keep agitating it
8873574 if we were to finish in the top half of the premier league i think everybody at wigan athletic including the fans would be delighted i would be happy and i am sure steve would be as well
8873575 its a long season and a hard season so a lot will depend on injuries and of course how lady luck looks at you
8873576 im 100 convinced im right but sometimes i dive the wrong way
8873577 in my head im right all the time but obviously its not always going to be like that
8873578 i was convinced wed win if youd put two jumpers down i thought wed still win
8873579 hes a big character and a big personality and i think he showed that with his antics before the penalties
8873580 he made a real impact for us he had to step up to the plate
8873581 hes an excellent keeper most keepers improve with age and hes very young for the position that he plays but i have to say even before i worked with him i was always very impressed with his ability and tonight hes come up trumps for us again he was excellent
8873582 we dug in showed what a good team we are what a good bunch of lads we are and got the result
8873583 regardless of which team went through today i think they would have done well in the tournament luckily its us weve taken that step forward and its big to go into the group stages and really push on
8873584 it skimmed off my head took a slight deflection and went in
8873585 i was just pleased i got on and made an impression
8873586 first of all we have to progress from the group stage and to do that you need 10 points to qualify
8873587 the tournament really kicks off in february that is when it gets exciting the one off knock out stages
8873588 i think we have a squad to challenge the best but you cannot think of yourselves as favourites when you see teams like ac milan barcelona and juventus all great names
8873589 we will make sure we apply ourselves in the right way then we will have a chance
8873590 its great to test yourself against a side like chelsea and im thoroughly looking forward to it
8873591 if we go there and put in a solid performance play good football and get a positive result it could kick start our season
8873592 chelsea look good they look solid they have a way of playing a direct style and they are strong but every team can be beaten look at us for example i wouldnt have thought wed lose our first two games
8873593 were more than capable of beating them its just about performing on the day
8873594 if you win your home games you will finish high up the table
8873595 its always a bonus to nick points from the top four but winning at home is what we need to do on a regular basis
8873596 i think once things settle down behind the scenes and stabilises then i think the players will be pleased
8873597 if we have any more violence we could withdraw the champions league final from rome
8873598 if you come to rangers and the first old firm game passes you by then you will regret it
8873599 we will have the boys focused we have been crying out for some creativity due to the absence of barry ferguson and we have that now
8873600 we have lads who can play the ball and play passes and in an old firm game that can be important
8873601 if you can turn over one of your main rivals away from home then it is a massive boost
8873602 you want to go to parkhead pittodrie tannadice and pick up points and if you can do that then you are going to have a good season
8873603 we have a good home record and if we can pick up points at the major grounds this season then that will stand us in good stead
8873604 i didnt suffer too many defeats in my career and hopefully i can pass that good fortune on to the lads for this weekend

8873608 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8873609 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8873610 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8873611 he will have to get used to it because it is different to spain but he showed he is a world class player both at madrid and for brazil and world class players adapt
8873612 the romanian team is of interest to us because im not aware of them at all
8873613 any team that reaches the group stage of the champions league deserves respect so we wont underestimate them

8873632 est absolutamente politizada en un acto fuera de lo educativo un grupo de bibliotecarias ingresaron a la fuerza al ministerio y se quedaron en el pasillo lo que el sutef ha planteado como modus operandi permanente
8873633 fueron recibidos por el ministro que aclar cada punto no hubo clausura de biblioteca no hubo actitudes inconsultas
8873634 se inund un aula y la prioridad es dar clases entonces se traslad la biblioteca a la direcci n para que se pueda seguir funcionando y la gente plantea que el ministerio propone que no existan m s las bibliotecas yo ya no se como demostrar con acciones y palabras que desde este ministerio la prioridad es dar clase y que en tres d as se iba a solucionar el tema
8873635 viendo las particularidades de cada colegio inclusive viendo la incidencia que ha tenido la medida de fuerza en algunos colegios por ejemplo el sobral con una adhesi n muy fuerte y el mart con una adhesi n leve cada colegio va a solicitar una readecuaci n particular ah participan los asesores pedag gicos para ver si es necesario poner un poco mas de fuerza en la readecuaci n de contenidos esta modificaci n tiende a recuperar jornadas y contenidos transformando d as que no eran de clase en d as de clase
8873636 si hubiera una real predisposici n alcanzar an los s bados para recuperar pero se enfrascan en discusiones surrealistas en la ltima reuni n llegaron a una incoherencia tal que aceptaron las cosas y despu s desconocieron a los paritarios entonces perdimos una reuni n para ver qui n era qui n
8873637 yo no s si los legisladores van a querer porque el sutef marca el camino ellos dicen que se quieren juntar con la gobernadora con los legisladores y vamos a ver que dicen los legisladores nosotros no tenemos problemas en juntarnos con los legisladores porque de hecho esa reuni n que hicimos con los legisladores en casa de gobierno destrab la problem tica pero el sutef quiere utilizar a los legisladores

8873696 the easybeats are an integral foundation stone of australian rock and roll
8873697 as a band they really were the first truly oz rock export and as songwriters performers and producers the band became the genesis of so much amazing australian music with harry vanda george young and stevie wright in particular all writing many hits and george and harry playing a hand in the careers of some of our greatest artists including ac dc the angels rose tattoo john paul young and of course stevies solo career
8873698 therefore to have this tribute album featuring these extraordinary homegrown artists playing easybeats songs is really a fitting testament to the easybeats and their long standing influence as songwriters and performers of some of the greatest songs that shaped our industry

8873709 we believe that a high resolution online imagery service like nationwide prime which is updated quarterly with the latest commercial and publicly available data will give arcgis users an invaluable base for a wide variety of gis projects and applications

8873743 on top of that we are obviously paying careful attention to reliability and the way the car behaves over the monza kerbs an aspect of the package that saw us in difficulty last year
8873744 i think we are working well even if we will only have the first real confirmation of this after qualifying for the italian grand prix
8873745 i dont think you can come into a state like ohio and have any success at all with a complete free trade policy and lack of concern about the downside of globalization
8873746 this is an issue that would play very very well with a demographic he needs to pick up
8873747 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta
8873748 democrats have to tread lightly because bill clinton was in the white house when nafta passed
8873749 the nafta stuff will in fact come back into the campaign dramatically

8873760 neither i am a tibetan nor a buddhist even then i am into a purely humanity and peace based never ending relationship with tibetans
8873761 in international cricket you shouldnt take anything for granted and bangladesh is a good example of that because as soon as we did they gave our backsides a kick
8873762 so our bowlers will have to be on the mark and i guess our batters especially if the conditions do move around which im assuming they will with a 9 30 start
8873763 the ball might move around a little bit so if we end up batting first i think our batters are going to have to switch on at the start as well
8873764 every batsman around the world has the same area of weakness
8873765 if you can bowl consistently in the good spots then you are going to compete and thats our challenge to our bowlers to be consistent int their lengths and their lines and bowl to their fields
8873766 there is no secrets in the world about where to bowl to players its been the same for 150 years
8873767 we always talk about the fact that we have a win here we have a win there
8873768 were trying to be more consistently competitive snatching a win here and snatching a win there is not what im about in the future its about being consistent
8873769 coming to australia and everyone knowing that we can be competitive not asking do you think you might win a game
8873770 how many games are you going to win is what i want people to ask
8873771 were constantly on the watch for any potential mergers that have the prospect or the possibility of lessening competition
8873772 but i wouldnt want to comment at this particular point as to whether this merger has has the possibility of lessening competition well just subject it to normal inquiries and the normal investigation
8873773 very often claims are being made that independence will be preserved but the financial incentives and other commercial incentives might tend to a different position

8873775 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8873776 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8873777 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8873778 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8873779 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
8873780 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
8873781 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8873782 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in

8873805 i felt comfortable in the car and we could do a lot of laps and found some items that will help us move forward and prepare for the race here
8873806 we had some work to do to find a good set up that works over the kerbs and in the slow corners without losing time on braking or on the straights and also trying to get a good setup with the inertia dampers
8873807 we made some good steps forward that will also help us at next weeks belgian grand prix so i am happy and feel quite prepared for these coming races

8873815 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis she said
8873816 i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away coin said
8873817 like i was just playing on the courts and playing against a girl like it was just a normal match for me
8873818 and then it came back maybe match point and i was like ok now its like the last point and you need to win the last point then the pressure came back
8873819 im very satisfied so far the way its gone williams said
8873820 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it venuse said
8873821 the message to the players is dont worry about things that are out of your control
8873822 what i say in the media what adam goodes says in the media what brett kirk says in the media all thats irrelevant really
8873823 they are a group that is really finding it hard to come up with answers and as a coach my message to them is the answers are on the field
8873824 the answers wont be found in a video session or a game plan book the answers are out on the scg tomorrow night and they are very very simple
8873825 but its about actions i can talk they can talk we can all talk its not hard to do that
8873826 we started off the season people said we couldnt make the eight weve done that again
8873827 there are now some questions about us again and hopefully we can answer those questions also
8873828 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well
8873829 and thats the challenge for all of us tomorrow night is to get back into form
8873830 the disappointment that were not going to play finals that will hang around for a long time

8873840 for eight years weve seen what happens when a president lets washington values become more important than american values
8873841 gas prices skyrocket when the white house lets oil companies call the shots
8873842 and children are left behind when an administration cares more about sound bites than sound schools and middle class families are left to fend for themselves to save their grasp on the american dream
8873843 but for the rest of us the american dream means one home safe neighborhoods good schools and good health care does that seem like too much to ask
8873844 for barack obama for joe biden for me for all of us the principles of faith call us to service
8873845 for faith in the american dream we strive for better schools economic justice and smarter foreign policies including the god given principles of equality freedom and opportunity
8873846 we need to put our faith into action to elect a president who will invest in our students teachers and schools and make college affordable again for every american family
8873847 we need to put our faith into action to elect a president who will responsibly end the war in iraq and give our veterans and their families the support they need

8873860 i told some students today even if youre not in need of extra tutoring youll have that opportunity to do some homework during school and free up some time at home
8873861 indraprastha gas is a defensive pick again we like this because of its sustained business model of 5 7 years profitability besides this is a debt free company so there is no interest burden on the company we have seen a lot of liquidation in this stock from institutional investors who have come out of the stock in last six months but now that selling has almost stopped and now we are seeing a significant accumulation in the stock from domestic fund side if we see the business model they are into compressed natural gas cng and piped natural gas png business in cng side they are already catering to around 2 lakh plus vehicles in northern india and in pipe natural gas they are having more than 1 2 lakh customers in ncr territory
8873862 in delhi on standalone basis there are more than 4 million lpg connections so it will take at least 8 10 years to bridge that gap from liquefied petroleum gas lpg to cng conversion if consumers are going to convert besides this they are also venturing into noida and greater noida where pipeline are already been laid and revenue list are coming from last quarter they have also ventured into harayana so looking at cng as an alternative mode of fuel and with high crude prices we are visualizing a sustained cagr of around 20 and same cagr in bottomline in this company for at least next three years so looking at all this the stock is again available at 8 pe multiple from fy09 earnings so from here again we are expecting a 30 kind of appreciation in this in one calendar year
8873863 while recommending midcap stocks we have four criteria in house first is there should be less debt burden on the company so that they can sustain this high interest cost regime and there should be sustained track record of 5 7 years of revenue growth as well as profitability there should be less public float and more institutional float in any stock and it should be into defensive domain so after that only we are recommending our midcap ideas jubilant organosys is a very good pharma pick at current valuations if we see the business model it is an integrated pharma company which works across all pharma value chain they are having four business verticals which are pharma and life sciences drug discovery and delivery performance fibers and industrial products one good thing is in last five years their bottomline has shown a more than 60 cagr and we are expecting same momentum to continue
8873864 if we see the triggers in the stock in last financial year they have acquired one company called draxis health in canada this year we are expecting a 50 of their topline to come from this company besides this company is also exporting 46 of their products to us and other markets so with current fall in rupee we are expecting they are going to be additional benefited besides this if we see their float also like there is around 18 free float with public in the stock and there is high 32 institutional float in this company looking at all this the stock is available at only 8 price earning pe multiple from fy09 earnings so it is having a growth potential of 30 from current valuation to appreciate in this financial year
8873865 i love it here already danvilles so pretty and its nice to see green im so used to concrete im not sure how my parents will take it but i may never go back to l a

8873897 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
8873898 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
8873899 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8873900 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8873901 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8873902 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8873903 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8873904 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8873905 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8873906 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8873907 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8873908 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8873909 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8873910 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8873911 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8873912 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8873913 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8873914 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8873915 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8873916 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8873917 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages
8873918 eyesight of thousands to be saved after nice approves drug

8873920 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8873921 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8873922 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8873923 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8874026 it was apparent at this meeting that the governor did not presume kilpatricks innocence
8874027 to the contrary at this meeting the governor and her staff had prepared a blackboard scenario in which his presumption of innocence was ignored and significantly undercut
8874028 the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad
8874029 jobs in michigan and diversifying our economy and getting barack obama elected as president

8874035 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8874036 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8874037 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8874038 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
8874039 and they were talking just about money money money money money
8874040 i dont think that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation im sure that that poor guy is not sophisticated and clever and capable enough to carry out that job
8874041 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8874042 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8874043 until we gain access to the house and complete our search and examination we are not in a position to make any further comment on such issues

8874051 this is a key investment for ams which will allow us to consolidate our existing operations in a state of the art facility support our growth plans and further strengthen our position as a leading technology driven medical device company
8874052 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items
8874053 it seemed to me that the clintons did what they needed to do
8874054 but it does also seem like the last two days were more about them than him
8874055 we view this as a disappointing outcome for renovo as this sequential approach significantly pushes back potential product launch we now forecast launch in 2014 having previously assumed 2012
8874056 in addition we now believe the company will require further funding albeit not for a number of years
8874057 declaring its first profit however modest is undoubtedly a landmark event for cyprotex
8874058 cyprotex now possesses greater confidence and remains optimistic of securing further growth in the second half
8874059 these cuts will be particularly evident at banks which will continue to pay in shares rather than in a dividend
8874060 the credit crunch will also mean that for the foreseeable banks are not going to be able to lend money to other companies
8874061 this will result in them reducing their dividends even more as they look to cut their outgoings
8874062 i believe that we will see an increasing number of companies cutting their dividends towards christmas as they strive to retain cash
8874063 we are going to see the worst of the economic situation unfurl over the next six months which is because the stock market is always 12 months ahead of whats going on in the real world
8874064 while some companies will reduce their dividend yield it is also possible that those same companies might also have seen their share price decrease
8874065 so if you sell now your capital yield will be less which makes the whole situation a case of chicken and egg
8874066 therefore my advice to investors is to stick the current situation out we are currently getting through the worst of it
8874067 many companies in the banking retailing and building sectors have reverted to biding their time by handing out shares rather than dividends
8874068 the credit crunch looks set to continue for some time and we can see this moving into other sectors
8874069 i would not be surprised if an increasing number of companies in the pubs entertainment and leisure sector also cut dividends for example
8874070 the strength of our balance sheet in the current credit crisis coupled with the attractiveness of the end markets we serve confirms our confidence in the future
8874071 appearing on the dragons den was a fascinating experience and an excellent learning curve
8874072 to prepare myself for the appearance on the show which was filmed earlier this summer i made sure that i thoroughly researched everything about the industry im in as well as thermaskirt
8874073 the product range is going well weve seen a lot of interest from housebuilders as well as the proprietors of residential parks
8874074 thermaskirt is appealing to people who want to cut their greenhouse gas emissions save money and also have a heating system which doesnt intrude into their homes
8874075 we are also looking at the potential for launching the product across europe and america from where we are receiving great interest in what we do

8874084 i was adamant that the footpath would be done by the time the children went back to school and weather permitting it will be done by the end of the week i know people in the area have been waiting a long time and we are delighted that through the efforts of both ourselves and tony walsh in the county council the problems were ironed out and we were able to finally go and get the job done
8874085 in response to member demand we hosted a similar briefing in dublin in late july during the builders holidays yet in excess of 100 cif member companies attended these seminars are set up to address problems that cif member companies are experiencing in their dealings with third parties including revenue and the banks and related issues such as conserving cash liquidity director duties and ultimately achieving work out solutions ill be taking the opportunity to meet with cif members from throughout waterford wexford and south tipperary and hear from them the situation on the ground
8874086 many cif members have spoken to me and my colleagues about their problems in dealing with banks and other third parties and the huge challenges that are faced in the current economic climate in response to this i have engaged with baker tilly ryan glennon with a view to allowing cif members access their particular experience on these issues
8874087 we are delighted to partner with the construction industry federation in delivering this series of presentations across the country
8874088 we regularly receive reports from schools of problems with people blocking roads and entrances
8874089 find a safe place to park maybe a little bit way from the school and walk down we have major problems at a number of city centre schools in particular with huge congestion and it results in a very dangerous situation
8874090 there may well be 50km per hour speed limit in front of schools but there is now way anyone should be going anything like that speed when approaching a school motorist should slow down well before coming near a school and be conscious of people and children stepping off paths or exiting cars
8874091 if your child walks or cycles to school take them on the route in advance and make sure they know where they are going if they travel by car or bus make sure they know how important it is to put their seatbelt on at all times
8874092 we would also ask teach ers to consider including a road safety lesson from the rsas road safety resources in their classes
8874093 the decision to refer patients to the whitfield clinic for pet scanning is open to clinicians along with the option of referring patients to cork and dublin
8874094 the hse is satisfied with the quality and level of service provided at the whitfield clinic
8874095 in the interests of best patient care the service level agreement was developed with input and agreement from hospital consultants in cancer care
8874096 the importance of collecting reliable data cannot be over stated as it allows the h s e and other government departments such as the national drug strategy team the interdepartmental group on drugs and department of community rural and gaeltacht affairs along with the south east regional drug task force to monitor the use of services and to plan services for the future
8874097 we had been to dunmore east earlier this year when we were requested by the local school to visit the area and this time we are back for our first ever public screenings in the area
8874098 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future
8874099 the strategy i am launching today outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
8874100 it was always our aspiration to cover ulster teams in the all ireland stages of the championship

8874110 thousands of mozambicans visit south africa every year to trade and so business
8874111 we have broadened our focus to emphasise tourism and leisure to the people of mozambique
8874112 that is why we emphasise travelling must not be done alone but must be done with friends
8874113 it was one of those experiences which opened up my eyes to the experiences available out there
8874114 youngsters out there need to get off the couch and travel this country of ours
8874115 we invited the industry to submit wines for consideration in an open tender
8874116 submissions were chosen in a blind tasting by members of the cape winemakers guild according to the same exacting standards applied when choosing wines for its annual auction
8874117 the project aims to do more than transfer basic wine knowledge
8874118 trainees will be equipped to serve wine with greater competence and confidence however we also hope they will make wine their alcoholic beverage of choice and reach a broader base of south africans and introduce them to wine appreciation
8874119 the training module designed by specialists already successfully training in the hospitality industry across southern africa will give candidates a basic understanding of wine that is relevant to their own life experience
8874120 it will allow them to communicate with a fair degree of knowledge about the wines they will be selling in the restaurants hotels and lodges where they are working or will be seeking jobs and equip them to articulate to customers what makes south african wines so special
8874121 our dream is that among this group there will also be some sufficiently inspired to advance their training still further and become sommeliers either by studying through the cape wine academy or by gaining experience or training abroad
8874122 mayor clarence johnsons generous move allows us to begin training immediately in the heartland of the wine industry where visitor expectations for good wine service will understandably be at their highest

8874127 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
8874128 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
8874129 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

8874134 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit

8874150 obama dovr ricostruire il sogno americano e restituire allamerica il suo prestigio nel mondo
8874151 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8874152 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8874153 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8874154 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8874155 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica

8874158 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8874159 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8874160 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8874161 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8874162 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8874163 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8874164 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8874165 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8874166 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8874167 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
8874168 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
8874169 weve decided not to take any more rentals onto our books for the next two weeks we have an over supply of properties at the moment
8874170 we would have twice the number of rentals on the books now as last year
8874171 properties in the right area and of good quality are renting well but the lower end are taking longer
8874172 people are willing to under cut each other to get the right tenant rather then leave it empty
8874173 landlords who have not got their property in pristine condition will loose out

8874198 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
8874199 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8874200 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8874201 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8874202 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8874203 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8874204 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8874205 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8874206 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8874207 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8874208 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8874209 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8874210 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8874211 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8874212 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8874213 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8874214 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8874215 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8874216 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8874217 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8874218 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8874219 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8874220 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8874221 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8874222 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8874223 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8874224 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8874225 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8874226 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8874227 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8874228 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8874229 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8874230 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8874231 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8874232 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8874233 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8874234 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8874235 who are open to doing something on the production side
8874236 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8874237 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8874238 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8874239 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8874240 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8874241 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8874242 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8874243 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8874244 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8874245 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8874246 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8874247 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8874248 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8874249 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
8874250 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8874251 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8874252 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8874253 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8874254 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8874255 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8874256 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8874257 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8874258 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8874259 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8874260 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8874261 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8874262 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8874263 there were more than 30 000 people there in spite of the 3 0 in the away leg and we wanted to honour those people
8874264 the game confirmed that nobody at this club is here to warm the bench because everybody played so well
8874265 in qualifying for the uefa cup we have showed that we are ready to achieve serious objectives
8874266 we will accept whoever we are drawn against every team at this stage is at a certain level even if some are better than others we want to get through the next round as well so that we can reach the group stage
8874267 my condition is improving and i am preparing to come back for the second match of the league
8874268 yesterday i did a test i didnt feel pain today i worked harder to get back to playing more quickly i am on the right road i feel good and i will be back shortly
8874269 im sad about not being able to be there for the first match of the league i hope to be back for the match against genoa and i will be happy if we do as well there as we did last year
8874270 so its man united here we go again oh well if youre going to play in the champions league you might as well come up against the champions league champions it doesnt get any easier does it
8874271 you have to be honest about it and say this is an even stronger manchester united than the one we faced two years ago this time they are champions of europe and champions of england they are a better team now and that will make our job even harder
8874272 i was on the voting panel for that and ronaldo did get my vote i think it was fairly clear cut
8874273 villarreals reputation goes before them but ill need to do my homework on aalborg
8874274 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8874275 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8874276 it was all pre recorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8874277 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8874278 some people find it helpful to go to the cemetery and grieve and they leave their grief in the cemetery
8874279 there are some people who for whatever reason do not want to have this farewell
8874280 some people find it is a great honour and remembrance
8874281 my family will cherish this diamond for generations and i expect other families will want to do the same
8874282 before you bella my life was like a moonless night
8874283 you know it wasnt that bad maybe they should have watched it drunk
8874284 you know what this is a fucking embarrassment pack up lets go

8874300 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement

8874313 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

8874631 mothers are the primary carers for small children in afghanistan
8874632 they are critical in securing better healthcare for children and particular attention should be paid to maternal autonomy at the household level for promotion of the health status of children in afghanistan
8874633 regarding child marriages not only the married child but also the children of child mothers are subject to a number of disadvantages the poor economic and educational status of these women and their overall immaturity caused by a lack of learning opportunities may have resulted in difficulties in preventing illness in their children
8874634 culturally appropriate programs that provide families and communities with education and reproductive health services can help stop child marriage
8874635 governments should play a role in this endeavour as well as strengthen efforts to meets the basic material needs of citizens

8874643 the republicans cant seem to catch a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8874644 public messaging and attention to the public affairs part of the response is going to get added attention
8874645 the american people want to know the people they elected are paying attention care about them and are making decisions they need to make
8874646 the smart thing is not to poke their chests out and say what a great job theyre doing or going to do but just to do what needs to be done
8874647 hindu and christian peace committees have been meeting and the leaders have appealed for calm
8874648 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8874649 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
8874650 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
8874651 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
8874652 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8874653 brandt said arnold told a cellmate she put the baby in the microwave and turned it on because she was worried her boyfriend would leave her if he found out the child wasnt his brandt said
8874654 well im gonna go to jail over this maybe i shouldnt do it
8874655 if we come to the irrevocable conclusion that we should have an election its not because we have polls that are any different than anybody else
8874656 its because that while weve had 2 1 2 years of government all the signs indicate that this parliament is at the end of its usefulness
8874657 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8874658 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire

8874663 mr kidd i am your biggest fan i have always wanted to be just like you
8874664 well you have the right clothes and you have a nice black hat and i see you rode up on a black horse but can you shoot
8874665 not bad can you shoot with your left hand a gunfighters got to be able to shoot with both hands
8874666 thats mighty fine shooting i just have one piece of advice for you
8874667 well go back into the kitchen there and get a big tub of lard take both of your pistols and rub them around in the lard get them good and slick
8874668 why is that important what good will rubbing my pistols in lard do
8874669 it wont help your shooting at all but when wyatt earp finishes playing the piano over there hes going to shove both of your pistols up your ass
8874670 after scoring a great goal he came in and had a right go which was good he said we were showing newcastle too much respect and we had to get closer to them and he was right
8874671 i thought we did well when we went back out and in extra time but for some reason we always seem to take time to get going
8874672 we need to start like we did after the break against newcastle when we put everything we had into it and played some good stuff we are encouraged by the performance and we have got to take that into saturdays game against another good footballing team
8874673 i played against them last year and they like to pass it a bit very similar to bristol city but we will go there and be very positive
8874674 i dont think 3 0 was a fair reflection of the game last saturday so we cant be too down we had three wins on the bounce before that and we have just got to get back to winning ways on saturday
8874675 i think it should be a good game especially if we can get the ball down and play like them because we are not built to play the ball long and hopefully we can come away with a win
8874676 it is a lovely pitch which i think has some sort of artificial grass in it to keep it good through the winter it is a nice new stadium and although it is not the biggest i am sure they will fill it with a good atmosphere
8874677 they will see us as a big scalp because they have come up from league one and coventry were in the premier league not so long ago so it all bodes well for a good game
8874678 i think they will be up for it a bit more when they see the likes of clinton morrison playing for us we will go into games expecting to win but you have to handle that pressure
8874679 i think it is a good sign that you are still picking up points when you are not playing as well as you know you should and i think when we start playing well hopefully everything will fall into place
8874680 the injuries havent helped and stephen wright has been unlucky with his hopefully he will be back soon and we can get everyone fit and then kick on
8874681 elliott ward is on penalties and loves to score so he thinks there is a bit of rivalry among the defenders to get goals
8874682 scott is off the mark now i think he should have been a while back he is very dominant in the air and is powerful but has been very unlucky with clearances off the line and stuff
8874683 my corners werent the best the other night but aron gunnarssons throw ins seemed to work and it is another threat if we can chip in at the back then it takes the pressure off the front lads
8874684 way cool site and right on point the public school system in my county has several high schools tied into a partnership program where students here align with students in another country works very well for spanish and german from what i gather i signed up for your newletter im a dabbler in farsi amp mandarin and would like to take both to the next level

8874755 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8874756 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8874757 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8874758 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8874759 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8874760 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8874761 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8874762 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8874763 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8874764 aux c t s de tous les opprim s de la plan te
8874765 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8874766 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8874767 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8874768 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8874769 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8874770 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8874771 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8874772 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8874773 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8874774 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8874775 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8874776 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8874777 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8874778 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8874779 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8874780 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8874781 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8874782 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8874783 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8874784 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8874785 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8874786 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8874787 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8874788 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8874789 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8874790 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8874791 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8874792 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8874793 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8874794 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8874795 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8874796 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8874797 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8874798 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8874799 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8874800 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8874801 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8874802 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8874803 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8874804 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8874805 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8874806 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8874807 no one works for someone we all just work together
8874808 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8874809 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8874810 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8874811 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8874812 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8874813 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8874814 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8874815 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8874816 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8874817 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8874818 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8874819 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8874820 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8874821 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8874822 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8874823 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8874824 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8874825 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8874826 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8874827 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8874828 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8874829 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8874830 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8874831 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8874832 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8874833 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8874834 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8874835 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8874836 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8874837 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8874838 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8874839 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8874840 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8874841 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8874842 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8874843 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8874844 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8874845 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8874846 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8874847 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8874848 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8874849 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8874850 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8874851 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8874852 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8874853 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8874854 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8874855 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8874856 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8874857 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8874858 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8874859 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8874860 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
8874861 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them
8874862 such a high percentage of polarization means you really have to have very good conditions a magnetic field that is very ordered
8874863 but once you get away from the pulsar then you get a much more complex situation because the field begins to break up into little patches and knots
8874864 finally it is a clear fact that our goodwill has gotten us to the point where our enemies are making a mockery of us
8874865 todays youths are not interested in taking up indigenous crafts after getting education they want to get employed in the government and private companies thus there is a huge dearth of skilled artisans
8874866 if i stop working who will take care of my unit where i have very few employees i am trying to motivate young boys and girls of my village barheta in bihar to take up my art
8874867 they feel that after completing college education they should have a proper job they dont want to struggle like their parents but we are motivating youngsters of the country to take up various indigenous crafts to earn their livelihood and simultaneously save various crafts from dying
8874868 villages are the cradles of indian crafts so we are trying hard to empower artisans to use their inherent skills as a means of earning their livelihood it is sad that in spite of our rich legacy several craftsmen in the country are having to fight hard against poverty
8874869 as a result such monuments could fade from public consciousness
8874870 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains geography at a stroke by not including them on maps
8874871 were in danger of losing what makes maps unique giving us a feel for a place
8874872 this is tragic they call this a map but it is so inadequate it has not been interpreted in any way it has no landmarks on it
8874873 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8874874 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8874875 sure a man is nothing when confronted by the power of the almighty
8874876 the downside risk to our growth expectations in 2008 09 is primarily from a further deterioration in global conditions with attendant impact on india be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets
8874877 all our schools and colleges are closed today friday let me clarify survival is more important than education
8874878 our teachers told us thursday that our school is closed friday
8874879 the college is closed to express solidarity for the violence victims
8874880 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise it s never too late for the brain and body to recover
8874881 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8874882 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8874883 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8874884 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8874885 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8874886 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate

8874891 this is another important milestone for the mcc universities programme bringing together some of the best players from the six university centres of cricketing excellence to play against their south african counterparts and ecbs elite under 19 cricketers can only help to improve each and every players game in helping to fund and organise this tournament mcc is deepening its commitment to the universities scheme and continues to provide opportunities both on and off the pitch for talented players we look forward to seeing some good cricket in loughborough
8874892 this tournament is the perfect vehicle for us in two ways not only will this serve as a final trial for selection on england under 19s tour to south africa in january 2009 but it will help us to continue the development of englands under 18s as we look towards the next icc under 19 world cup in 2010 we expect the competition from both mcc and south african universities to be committed and intense so it promises to be a successful tournament in loughborough

8874916 the s1000fds shooting performance results were a bit disappointing from power on to the capture of your first image takes about 3 2 seconds shutter delay the elapsed time between pressing the shutter and capturing an image was about 1 10 of a second when pre focused and between 5 8 10 of a second including autofocus time the shot to shot delay averaged about 4 6 seconds without flash and 5 seconds with flash one annoyance i found was the lcd evf blacks out in between shots with and without the flash while the image is being processed which is a critical time for framing the next shot
8874917 they catch it and they go and hit it thats the biggest thing
8874918 consistently hilarious stupendously silly and played with over the top sincerity by a superbly comic cast

8874941 this is consistent with previous announcements that the workforce was likely to be reduced by around 2 000 jobs by 2011 with the majority leaving the company this year
8874942 as previously announced around 500 of the job losses were achieved through voluntary redundancy and 800 through compulsory redundancy
8874943 northern rock has been able to limit the total number of redundancies through a process of internal redeployment into new roles within the restructured business
8874944 the majority of those leaving due to redundancy have either already done so or will leave today
8874945 the company continues to work very closely with one northeast to offer comprehensive outplacement support services to help those leaving the company find alternative employment either locally or outside the region
8874946 the reduced size of the company means that it does not need as much office space as it currently occupies or was projected to need
8874947 it has therefore been decided that northern rock will seek to sell or offer for rent the new office space it is developing at rainton bridge near sunderland and gosforth newcastle upon tyne
8874948 the company will retain its two main office sites in gosforth and doxford park sunderland as well as its local and national branch and sales network
8874949 this has been a very difficult period for the whole company

8874966 since we have drawn the sword our primary purpose ought to be to strike hard at the enemy which in the aftermath of 9 11 means those who practice or abet terrorism its debatable whether our blow against saddam hussein effectively aimed at them but there is surely no dispute that this is the proper aim of military action those who help us to achieve it in iraq and elsewhere in effect demonstrate their opposition to terrorism and help us to promote the alternative of respect for human moral worth but the aim of war is first to damage and defeat the foe if in the process we help the iraqis to take some steps toward a permanent regime of liberty that will be a good thing but it should not be our measure for the success or failure of our efforts
8874967 our current political leaders appear to have embarked on a strategy of demographic subversion that will dethrone the american people as presently constituted and replace them with a majority more easily dominated and controlled by wealthy or bureaucratically powerful elites they are working toward the day when the american people look and behave more like the people of mexico who have never achieved sovereign control of their government despite the outward forms of democratic self government

8874972 birmingham is the uks second city however we are first in terms of diversity im proud to represent such a culturally diverse population which serves as a model of community cohesion for other parts of the country hundreds of thousands of our citizens have a connection to the indian sub continent i think its important for me as a representative of those citizens to promote birmingham to their countries of cultural origin
8874973 i believe that my official visit to pakistan and bangladesh will be an opportunity to raise international awareness of the social cultural and economic contribution that has been made by pakistani indian and bangladeshi immigrants to the uk as a whole the message i will take with me is that birmingham is a great place to live we also want to encourage people from around the world to visit us and for foreign businesses to invest in the profitable opportunities birmingham has to offer
8874974 im very proud that chauhdry rashid who has served as my local councillor for more than 20 years has been given the honour of representing our fair city to the wider world his planned tour of the indian sub continent is a wonderful show of respect to communities that have been integral to birminghams economic success and im sure that he will be welcomed with open arms by the residents of sylhet dhaka the punjab and azad kashmir
8874975 i trust my directors i believe in the way they work and i let things happen i just try to act in the best way i can
8874976 it is a complicated film you cannot express the film or my character in a few words i play a strange and complex personality
8874977 the film is very costly because of its location the shooting equipment and the international artistes involved kerala is a small place and so it is only once in a blue moon that we can churn out such high budget films
8874978 i dont have a theatre background stage and cinema are two different things i have not done any research or done something extra to play my part i have read the play and i have just enacted it
8874979 the film is called nair san and it is based on a true story of a keralite boy who is settled in japan and is a freedom fighter the director is japanese and his name is albert the shooting of the film has begun the film is partly chinese as we are shooting there as well

8874982 i like to take up only one film at a time i dont like to do other things in between besides bollywood films require a lot of dates and sometimes my dates dont match also i feel one should be very comfortable with the character
8874983 it is an entirely different league a different art it is not an easy thing i will wait it has to happen otherwise i have no plans right now because i will have to stop my acting and then switch over to direction
8874984 i never demand i have my own production my own distribution so whenever i want to make a film i can but i never wish for any particular script

8874991 the value of good public transport services is evident in the changing land values along the new rail line the greens want to ensure people living in the suburbs are well served and protected from petrol price shocks by expanding public transport options for everyone not just the wealthy inner suburbs
8874992 at present the federal government does not fund metropolitan public transport at all leaving this vital responsibility entirely to the states
8874993 the greens are working to remedy this we want to redirect 25 of the 22 3 billion auslink 2 funding scheme for 2009 14 to metropolitan and regional public transport projects rising to 50 after 2014
8874994 we also propose that the state government make public transport the centrepiece of western australias allocation of funds from the 20 billion building australia fund the money is available the vision is there all we need is the commitment
8874995 the greens are the only party to advocate for public transport measures that will be desperately needed in the years to come

8875011 the interest was phenomenal and saw dozens of people subscribing to videos through our youtube channel
8875012 theres no way we would have got 175 000 hits if it had just been on our website
8875013 we started uploading our videos to youtube a few months ago as well as uploading them to our own video player and find it to be a fantastic way to get our content out there and have it noticed
8875014 the video is branded with the heralds logo so this success has meant our name is now known across the world and is associated with content people want to watch
8875015 i left school as soon as i could and knew what i wanted to do
8875016 during my time on the northern echo i did the usual round of courts and general reporting but perhaps the story that sticks out most in my mind was the big winter of 1963 when everything was frozen
8875017 i was sent up to the a66 to get through to the lorry drivers and motorists who were stranded there me and a photographer went to try to rescue them
8875018 it seems a bit stupid now looking back but we got through to these people and fought our way back to get the stories written up at 2am
8875019 then it was back to work as normal at 6am it felt like a big achievement
8875020 people are still really interested in local news and there is still a place for the local newspaper
8875021 it is up to those doing the reporting to provide that service and i have been very lucky with a dedicated staff many of whom have been with us for a very long time
8875022 east grinstead is a relatively small town so from an advertising and editorial point of view it didnt work so well
8875023 this one paper will be bigger and will better serve the town were all pretty optimistic about how its going to pan out
8875024 there will be more news from around the villages and at least five or six pages of sport every week
8875025 we have been publishing two separate titles in the town of east grinstead run by different teams under different editors and effectively competing against one another
8875026 we believe that it is more important to offer residents of the town the best a combined newspaper can offer and invest in upgrading our website to more effectively cater for readers
8875027 in addition the combination of a printed paper and website will represent a more attractive proposition for our advertisers
8875028 local publishers are reaching new and growing audiences across a range of platforms and a variety of distribution methods print digital part paid part free as they develop strategies to meet consumer demand for local news and information at a time and place that suits them
8875029 focusing purely on the ups and downs of a titles paid for print circulation no longer provides a meaningful measure of a local newspaper brands total reach
8875030 abcs move to combined reporting will help to bring greater clarity for advertisers who are now for the first time able to see a regional titles paid free and pick up print circulation figures all on one certificate
8875031 the next step is for audited website traffic figures for many of the sectors flagship sites to be available alongside print figures
8875032 circulation remains challenging across the entire regional newspaper industry but it is within local and regional media that some of the most receptive audiences and some of the most exciting opportunities for growth lie
8875033 as a genuine cross media business we are providing many more options and opportunities for readers and advertisers
8875034 through the actions we are taking our regional business is evolving into a true multimedia publisher of scale
8875035 we are focused on serving our readers via our print titles companion websites and mobile platforms and we have the potential to reach larger audiences than we ever have done
8875036 we have always recognised we need to diversify to stay ahead of the competition

8875080 der bildungsmonitor zeigt dass wir auf dem richtigen weg sind und in sachsen eine nachhaltige bildungspolitik betreiben die von unseren lehrern hervorragend umgesetzt wird ein erster platz ist f r uns kein ruhekissen sondern eine gro e verpflichtung politik schule und eltern m ssen nun gemeinsam weiter daran arbeiten den bildungsstandort sachsen zukunftsf hig zu gestalten
8875081 die unterstellung bayerns ausbau der ganztagsschulversorgung f nde nur auf dem papier statt dokumentiert die unkenntnis der fdp gerade der ausbau der ganztagsschulen ist f r uns in bayern von zentraler bedeutung und wird auch in der zukunft von uns mit nachdruck verfolgt
8875082 es ist f r mich als bildungsminister schon ein mehr als zweifelhaftes vorgehen des spd politikers pfaffmann aus parteitaktischen gr nden die leistungen unserer sch lerinnen und sch ler schlecht zu reden
8875083 damals waren wir gerade ein jahr im amt wichtige reformen im bildungsbereich wie das neue schulgesetz der ausbau der ganztagsschule der hochschulpakt oder das kinderbildungsgesetz waren noch nicht umgesetzt oder gerade erst eingef hrt diese faktoren beginnen jetzt zu wirken der bildungsmonitor 2008 ist also die abschlussbilanz von rot gr n nicht die bilanz der politik der schwarz gelben landesregierung
8875084 der bildungsmonitor der die situation im jahr 2006 erfasst unterstreicht die notwendigkeit der anstehenden ver nderungen im bildungssystem in mecklenburg vorpommern gleichzeitig best tigt er uns darin dass wir uns auf die richtigen handlungsfelder konzentrieren
8875085 ist f r mich die anstehende schulgesetz nderung das wichtigste vorhaben f r die entwicklung der bildungsqualit t in mecklenburg vorpommern
8875086 die studie belegt mit zahlen und fakten die bildungsreformen dieser landesregierung machen sich bezahlt niedersachsen hat den anschluss an die f hrenden bundesl nder geschafft diesen weg wollen wir in den n chsten jahren weiter gehen gemeinsam k nnen wir viel erreichen das zeigt der bildungsmonitor 2008 ganz deutlich wenn wir jetzt die begonnenen reformen konsequent umsetzen notwendige korrekturen vornehmen und weiter den fokus auf die bildungspolitik richten dann k nnen wir uns auch k nftig ber positive ergebnisse f r niedersachsen bei bildungsstudien freuen
8875087 ich freue mich dass der bildungsmonitor 2008 unsere anstrengungen f r eine familiengerechte politik w rdigt wir werden diesen weg in berlin fortsetzen und die angebote gleichzeitig weiter verbessern
8875088 die kritik m ssen wir ernst nehmen allerdings muss man diesen punkt differenziert betrachten so steht die betriebliche ausbildung im fokus der untersuchung und nicht der schulische teil zugleich schl gt hier die strukturelle schw che des wirtschaftsstandortes berlin durch richtig ist dass wir einen schwerpunkt auf die berufliche bildung legen zum beispiel sollen leistungsschwache auszubildende k nftig besser gef rdert werden daf r habe ich veranlasst dass mit beginn des neuen schuljahres die teilnehmer an der einstiegsqualifizierung berufsschulpflichtig werden
8875089 wir nehmen die ergebnisse des bildungsmonitors mit interesse zur kenntnis werden sie einer gr ndlichen auswertung unterziehen und mit sicherheit auch wertvolle anregungen erhalten
8875090 die gr ten fortschritte h tten die bundesl nder bei der anzahl der sch ler mit fremdsprachenunterricht und bei der internationalen ausrichtung der hochschulen erzielt au erdem habe die gesamtdauer abgenommen in der schule und studium absolviert w rden zu den gr ten schw chen geh rten die weiter zur ckgegangene ausbildung von ingenieuren an deutschen hochschulen und die stagnation der ganztagsbetreuung in vielen bundesl ndern auf niedrigem niveau gerade in den technischen und naturwissenschaftlichen f chern fehlten lehrer die f r ein ingenieurstudium begeistern k nnten
8875091 sachsen und baden w rttemberg bieten aus konomischer sicht die beste bildung in deutschland

8875093 manchen fortschritt registrieren die forscher allerdings auch in nrw so gab es hier zu lande die zweitniedrigste schulabbrecher quote 6 6 prozent spitzenreiter baden w rttemberg 6 3 prozent und dass mehr als jeder zweite schulabg nger 52 prozent das abitur hat ist bundesweit spitze schlusslicht bleibt nrw dagegen bei der relation von professoren zu studenten
8875094 kinderg rten schulen und hochschulen in deutschland scheinen besser zu sein als ihr ruf
8875095 danach lernen mehr sch ler als bisher fremdsprachen die hochschulen sind internationaler geworden und die studenten kommen schneller zum abschluss als bisher
8875096 im schulischen bereich ist es dem bund gar gesetzlich untersagt den l ndern finanzielle hilfe zu leisten
8875097 sachsen hat einer aktuellen studie zufolge das beste bildungssystem in deutschland
8875098 an manchen tagen gibt es mehr vermeintliche gewinner als siegertreppchen gestern ist der
8875099 der freistaat sachsen ist mit seinem bildungssystem weiter f hrend in deutschland

8875101 nicht f r die sch ler sondern f r die landesregierung
8875102 so konnte sich nordrhein westfalen gegen ber der vorjahres untersuchung um 3 3 punkte auf 56 6 punkte verbessern schlusslicht ist das bundesland hingegen weiterhin bei den betreuungsbedingungen
8875103 ein d mpfer f r den musterknaben das institut der deutschen wirtschaft in k ln hat bayern bei der ingenieurs ausbildung ein schlechtes zeugnis ausgestellt hier zeigt sich also mal wieder der einst noch von stoiber selbst geschnitzte bildungspolitische bumerang man kann halt nicht einerseits spitzenkr fte einfordern damit man in wahlkampfzeiten stolz durch die blankpolierten hallen bayerischer hightech firmen schreiten kann und gleichzeitig am zukunfts rohstoff f r erfolgreiche unternehmen sparen den sch lern n mlich
8875104 bronze f r th ringen mit den h chsten bildungsausgaben f r grundsch ler der besten lehrer sch ler relation ab klasse f nf und der spitzenposition bei den berufst tigen ingenieuren konnte th ringen seinen dritten platz im f hrungstrio noch einmal ausbauen
8875105 trotz einiger fortschritte liegt nrw im vergleich der bildungssysteme der 16 bundesl ndern auf dem vorletzten platz
8875106 im bildungsmonitor 2008 stellen die autoren fest dass sich hessen in den meisten handlungsfeldern im mittelfeld befindet besonders schlecht schneidet das land aber bei der betreuung von grundsch lern ab statistisch gesehen st nde 22 4 sch lern nur ein lehrer gegen ber so wenig wie in einem anderen westdeutschen bundesland negativ bewertet die studie auch die zahl versp tet eingeschulten kinder mit 7 9 prozent ist dieser wert der zweith chste in deutschland
8875107 zu sp te einschulungen zu viele sitzenbleiber zu viele schulabbrecher die probleme sind bekannt sie m ssen nur gel st werden
8875108 die probleme l gen in der schule der anteil versp tet eingeschulter kinder sowie die wiederholungsquoten in grundschule und weiterf hrenden schulen lagen deutlich ber dem bundesdurchschnitt hei t es in der landesbewertung ein problem das bekannt ist und von der expertenkommission des landtages erst ende juni im bildungsbericht klar benannt wurde die experten empfahlen darin k nftig auf zur ckstellungen vom schulbesuch und klassenwiederholungen zu verzichten und f rderbed rftige sch ler zu integrieren

8875114 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact

8875116 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters

8875147 on the specific question of where packaged goods will go there are two factions but im clearly in the camp that doesnt think its going to go away before i retire so thats hopefully another 20 years or so the reason why im so convinced is that ive always been saying our softare developers eat up storage space so much quicker than telcos can build distribution you can always see technological quantum leaps in terms of digital distribution capacity its all true but if you see how those guys increase the size of games its just unbelievable

8875274 this is an issue that would play very very well with a demographic he needs to pick up
8875275 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta
8875276 democrats have to tread lightly because bill clinton was in the white house when nafta passed
8875277 the nafta stuff will in fact come back into the campaign dramatically
8875278 its a contrast that makes a great deal of difference in key states such as ohio pennsylvania and michigan

8875285 we are seeing significant competition among suppliers to provide the electricity we need to serve customers in 2010
8875286 we are confident that robust competition will continue in the years beyond 2010 and result in competitive prices for our customers
8875287 the proposal we have filed will enable us to meet our obligation to provide electricity supply at competitive prices for customers who dont choose their own alternative generation supplier
8875288 we also expect that our customers will have additional choices as we complete the transition to fully competitive electricity markets
8875289 in other parts of pennsylvania that have completed the move to fully competitive markets customers are choosing other suppliers and saving money compared with the default supply price charged by their local utility

8875313 our partnership with zipcar strengthens our commitment to provide the belmont university community with flexible environmentally friendly transportation options

8875315 the decline in the number of atlantic salmon returning to their native rivers in northern ireland and indeed in many other rivers throughout europe is a matter of concern here and elsewhere within the european union
8875316 the reasons for this decline have yet to be clearly established but what is evident is the need for us to take action to protect rivers in northern ireland which support populations that are of international importance
8875317 the protection of approximately 37 miles of the river faughan and its tributaries is an important addition to the 128 miles of river within the river foyle and river roe systems that are already protected in accordance with the habitats directive

8875344 we are alarmed by the rapid rise in prices of essentials like milk which is now costing at least 10 times more than the usual price of 10 12 rupees a litre bihar was already one of the poorest states in india before the flooding and these families who have been forced to leave their homes will be struggling to buy enough food to feed their children
8875345 children need extra attention in an emergency because their particular needs can often be overlooked young children need special food that is suitable for them to eat to make sure they stay healthy we need to make sure that vulnerable children who may have been separated from their parents are also able to get rations in relief camps

8875347 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

8875349 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8875351 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8875352 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8875353 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8875354 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8875355 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8875356 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8875363 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8875364 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8875365 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8875366 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8875369 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8875370 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8875371 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8875372 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8875373 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8875374 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8875375 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8875376 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
8875377 and they were talking just about money money money money money
8875378 i dont think that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation im sure that that poor guy is not sophisticated and clever and capable enough to carry out that job
8875379 the libyans have achieved what they want and western commerce has got what it wants too in this many of us feel like pawns

8875381 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8875382 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves

8875384 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8875385 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

8875387 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8875388 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8875389 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8875390 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8875391 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8875392 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8875393 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8875394 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8875395 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

8875397 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8875398 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8875399 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8875400 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8875401 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8875402 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8875403 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8875404 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8875405 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8875406 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

8875413 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8875414 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8875415 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8875416 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8875417 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8875418 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8875419 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8875420 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8875421 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8875422 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8875423 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8875424 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8875425 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8875426 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8875427 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8875428 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8875429 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8875430 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8875431 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8875432 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8875433 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8875434 they had a strong quarter which was widely expected but the outlook was light
8875435 the results for our second quarter were better than we had anticipated
8875436 the shortfall in october period revenue is disappointing due to expectations for in storage at both western digital and seagate which didnt come through in the outlook
8875437 yet even with a tepid view of the economy we are forecasting 14 to 16 percent revenue growth year over year which is way ahead of forecasts for the

8875489 the data landmines of today could be greatly reduced by the cloud as thin client technology becomes prevalent
8875490 there was a launch a few days ago of something and it is not quite clear what it was
8875491 advanced technology to launch its first remote sensing telecommunication satellite into space
8875492 they want to be able to build their own satellites they want to be able to launch their own satellites
8875493 no the satellite that was launched has a camera but it is not a camera that can bring you pictures good enough for any other purpose not a resolution that would allow you any military significance
8875494 i think one of the issues people are looking at is is the technology iran is developing now purely indigenous or are they getting outside assistance
8875495 the most likely source of outside assistance would be possibly north korea but more likely pakistan the recent ballistic missile that the iranians launched the so called ashoura missile may be a derivative of a pakistani design
8875496 where everyone is concerned because that technology is dual use and could also be used directly in military applications with warheads
8875497 what they showed on television in february was definitely a shahab 3 however at least one of the sources i read said that what was actually launched or tested in february was not a shahab and that the footage that they released did not belong to the vehicle actually tested
8875498 it looks like the iranians are moving away from liquid fuel missiles to solid fuel missiles and that is a big technological leap
8875499 if you are looking to have a military program solid fuel rockets are the way to go because you dont have to have all the fuelling trucks you dont have to have all the associated infrastructure you can fire them on much shorter notice
8875500 so if it is the case that iran is indeed moving towards solid propellant ballistic missiles that would have important military implications
8875501 it is not so much the satellite capability per se but if iran were to eventually develop the capability to launch satellites into medium and high earth orbit to have that capability means that you are also going to have the capability to manufacture ballistic missiles that can deliver a military payload to quite some distance well in excess of 2 000km
8875502 most countries in the middle east have their own communication satellite which they bought egypt has one turkey has several saudi arabia has too the uae has the most advanced communication satellite in the world
8875503 the iranians have been trying to do the same for the past 30 years and the project is not getting off the ground
8875504 it has a camera but i dont think it has any military significance it is a research satellite with the goal of training engineers to be able to build satellites to be able to conduct experiments in space
8875505 they are building with the help of some western companies their own research satellite but this is very very rudimentary
8875506 israel is much much more advanced than any other countries in the middle east with the ofeq and eros military imaging satellites
8875507 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8875508 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8875509 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8875510 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8875511 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8875512 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8875513 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8875514 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone

8875520 im out of here im withdrawing my combat forces form the area but peacekeepers are staying
8875521 there can be no return to the status quo ante
8875522 the caucasus is a russian region it has always been that way we are not going to let adventurers like georgian president mikheil saakashvili or us secretary of state condoleezza rice change that we are going to be an independent state within russia its logical
8875523 there are several possible outcomes considering these territories the first is that the europeans have been dropping hints about the possible internationalization of the conflict this would involve the stationing of observers and maybe peacekeepers in ossetia and abkhazia and their futures being brought under intense discussion
8875524 the eu and the us remain committed to georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity the most likely outcome i can imagine will be the north cyprus situation the world will recognize georgias territorial integrity while russia and maybe a few of its satellite states will acknowledge south ossetia and abkhazia as independent
8875525 the south ossetians already can see what an example of russian rule in the caucasus is like if they look to north ossetia how many schools there teach in ossetian the answer is none in a few years the concern of cultural autonomy will mount and they will begin to realize the trap they are in
8875526 the president turned this country from a sort of post soviet ruin into a modern country
8875527 however saakashvilis definitely in until september then i cant say there will be serious questions asked about what has happened and those questions will have consequences
8875528 under shevernadze we practiced a political balancing act between russia and the west just look at where we are on a map when the balance got upset we angered a neighbor and it destroyed so much of the good development that was going on we could have avoided this and just got rich
8875529 though my political and cultural values are completely western i am starting to think that georgia put all of its eggs in one basket
8875530 russia is a born again 19th century power that acts in the post 20th century world where arguments of force and capacity cannot any longer be the only way to define the status or conduct of great powers the absence of soft power is particularly dangerous for a would be revisionist state for if a state wants today to remake the world order it must be able both to rely on the existing and emerging constellation of powers and be able to capture the international publics imagination

8875571 this is an issue that would play very very well with a demographic he needs to pick up
8875572 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta
8875573 democrats have to tread lightly because bill clinton was in the white house when nafta passed
8875574 the nafta stuff will in fact come back into the campaign dramatically
8875575 its a contrast that makes a great deal of difference in key states such as ohio pennsylvania and michigan

8875994 we dont know enough about this yet to propose a great solution so whats the very next little thing the simplest thing that we could do that might just move us forward or might just give us enough information to work out how to move forward again lets do it if it doesnt give us any more information or leads us down a blind alley well what have we lost not much an hour at most
8875995 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8875998 in any case asif has already been suspended from all forms of cricket because of his positive dope test in the indian premier league
8875999 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8876000 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8876001 ik ben zeer tevreden met dit resultaat zeker als je weet dat ik al zolang niet meer met een rallywagen op onverhard terrein heb gereden
8876002 vanmorgen voelde de wagen niet zo goed aan tijdens de assistentie veranderde ik de afstelling waardoor ik wat meer overstuur kreeg ik groeide in de wedstrijd kreeg meer zelfvertrouwen in de laatste twee klassementsritten van de dag gebruikte ik teveel moeten remmen waardoor ik op een bepaald ogenblik geen voorste remmen meer had los van dat had ik geen technische problemen
8876003 fran ois heeft het uitstekend gedaan geleidelijk aan kwam hij in het ritme hij staat nu ideaal geklasseerd om punten te pakken voor ford
8876004 de luier heeft duidelijk de impact van de val verminderd
8876005 het is een wonder want ook die haak had fataal kunnen zijn voor het kind
8876006 the important thing was i had to come back in the third set and im happy with the victory
8876007 now im in the third round im happy for me its a very important tournament here
8876008 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still number one and the best youre going to be there again and stuff
8876009 so i feel like ive got unbelievable support from the fans watching me and seeing people in the streets and stuff its really nice

8876016 to sit and worry about inflation expectations rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8876017 people have to start to respond to the fact that we are in a recession and the danger is well be in a very serious and long lasting recession unless we do something this is a call to action
8876018 certainly has a great deal of wishful thinking attached to it
8876019 i feel that things i have been fearful about have come to pass and i have actually been pretty accurate in whats coming and i have failed to convince the others of what is appropriate
8876020 people need to understand that sometimes you will have to focus on the timing of issues i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on
8876021 i thought 30 per cent was the potential fall we could see
8876022 i think that might even now be optimistic i think 30 per cent does look a fairly optimistic number and markets are now coming around to that view
8876023 side effects may include drowsiness irritability and sudden loss of distinctive word balloons
8876024 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8876025 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8876026 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8876027 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8876028 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8876029 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8876030 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8876031 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8876032 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8876033 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country

8876051 wexford have shown themselves to be a very resilient team they will feel they can raise their game further and obviously we have to be ready for the challenge
8876052 from the minute the whistle went in our game against the dubs our thoughts have been on wexford we are certainly looking no further than this sunday it would foolish to so otherwise
8876053 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad
8876054 i dont think the outside world realises just how dangerous the situation is not just for israel but for the whole region
8876055 there is a very real danger that this could lead to over salination the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
8876056 our cousins i say that because the bible says we are cousins have been drilling in areas they should not and this is diverting the water this is the politics of the middle east
8876057 they should be setting up manydesalination plants to get water from other sources theyre using israeli expertise in these matters all over the world but this is the one country which isnt using it enough i dont think it would be possible to deprive the farmers of their water so what is needed is alternative sources its that simple
8876058 quite big cracks are now appearing on the walls of our home that is due to the heat caused by the drought this is the hottest i can remember we desperately need some rain pretty soon maybe this is global warming
8876059 but the pumping out of the water doesnt help my husband was a fisherman and he has seen how the water has gone over the years and with it the fishes
8876060 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low many fishermen fear for their livelihood and so do i but it seems no one really cares about us
8876061 of course many of the disciples of jesus were fishermen at galilee if you recall he said he would make them fishers of men well that wouldnt be possible now there are hardly any fish left around here
8876062 this country has found itself through circumstances as the keeper of some of the most precious things in the world both made by man and by nature it has a responsibility to the rest of mankind to look after these things they are failing to do this here at the sea of galilee

8876079 this is not the time to play politics on the issue i know this is the year of elections therefore people are out to make comments for political reasons
8876080 i felt great came off that turn i felt like i didnt spend much energy on the way out and felt good on that second lap
8876081 i knew youd have to be on your game this morning and no holding back at all
8876082 it gave me confidence i know i can swim my own race under pressure having that world record go before me i didnt want to get drawn into it i came out on top
8876083 what sullivan did was a great answer to my record but the main thing here is qualifying
8876084 its a new generation a new way of swimming im happy to make the final for the fourth time in a row
8876085 the work could be felt as a provocation on the part of the population of alto adige 99 per cent of whom are catholic
8876086 injured the feelings of many people who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god and of our salvation which deserves recognition and religious devotion
8876087 the work not only wounds the religious feelings of many who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god but also offends the good sense and feelings of those who do not identify with the symbol
8876088 the controversy has been exploited by politicians including mr pahl for electoral reasons its true the pressure was heavy but we are an autonomous museum and we have taken our decision the work aroused a lot of argument among visitors many liked it and many disliked it but the public row was merely political and it has gone on long enough

8876093 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8876094 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8876095 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8876096 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8876097 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8876098 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
8876099 this study provides further evidence for darwins theory of natural selection by showing that environmental conditions can directly impact genes controlling physical traits that affect the survival of species

8876121 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number 4 passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8876122 this step is biased and is aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8876123 i am sorry its not my fault its the new system we have put in
8876124 the past six months have continued to demonstrate pinewood sheppertons ability to diversify and deliver consistent revenue streams even in times of wider economic uncertainty
8876125 the level of visibility on prospective revenues reinforces the boards confidence in the outlook for the year as a whole
8876126 sum of the parts analysis suggests a decent share price upside although we accept that neither property nor media are particularly in vogue currently
8876127 the uk is one of the most competitive mobile markets in europe and we need our regulation to adapt to make sure we maintain that momentum
8876128 not everything will need more regulation in some cases it may well mean less
8876129 we want to get ahead of the game and ask sharp questions about whether there is a superior alternative not just presume that what we have done so far is right way
8876130 it may be that there isnt a better option and the alternatives are worse
8876131 the premise of the uso is largely gone not because people are not using the telephone but because they have a mobile
8876132 although times are challenging they want brands they can trust so strong brands will prevail the performance of our brands is very healthy
8876133 some things such as barley and corn are up dramatically but some things have hardly moved
8876134 with guinness we have outperformed the uk and irish beer market and we have shown strong growth in africa
8876135 we let ourselves down with the ball at lisburn they were difficult conditions and 180 was above par
8876136 im not making excuses because we can win without ryan and peter but we were without our best batsman and best bowler
8876137 that will not be easy either but when we are at full strength we are still a formidable outfit
8876138 retail conditions have been extremely tough this summer and the wet august has been a further blow sadly no let up is expected as we head into early autumn the business outlook is particularly weak and retailers are having to scale back their employment and investment plans in an attempt to ride out the storm
8876139 it is not going to get any better for 18 months
8876140 there has been a bit of a spike in fashion sales in the last two to three weeks but that has been driven by very aggressive discounting so very little has flowed through to margins
8876141 this improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence such as cheaper petrol offers summer holidays happening or just a general feeling of
8876142 this is not a surprise but its a worry a number of companies are considering similar moves and there will be a steady flow of these announcements unless the government tackles the issue
8876143 it is the legislative framework which we need to provide us with a regime in which we have greater ability and freedom to develop our business more profitably over the long term
8876144 this is a valid question for boards to ask are we domiciled in the best place tax is a really important part of financial management
8876145 this is not good news for the uk it puts pressure on the treasury to come up with a robust package to convince businesses that having their headquarters here is a benefit
8876146 the uk continues to offer one of the most competitive business tax regimes of any major economy including the lowest headline rate of corporation tax in the g7
8876147 we have been making things hard for ourselves lets be honest about that
8876148 we have not been as creative as we can be and we have been missing chances
8876149 meath are always hard to beat no matter at what level you meet them
8876150 we might have played well in passages of our matches but we need to maintain our form at this level it will be very demanding
8876151 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidates for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8876152 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8876153 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8876154 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8876155 bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8876156 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8876157 i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8876158 dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8876159 voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time
8876160 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8876161 in the hopes and dreams the competence and courage the rightness and readiness of barack obama
8876162 weve come a long way but we still have a distance to go
8876163 but we must march again we must march like we have never marched before to elect the next president of the united states barack obama
8876164 we would not be denying the climate crisis we would be solving the climate crisis
8876165 i didnt want the interval to come he mark had time to regroup and it showed in the second session
8876166 mark fought his way back into the match rather than me making mistakes he showed what hes capable of in those three frames he won
8876167 he plays far too openly so hell have to change but im sure he will do hell learn that he has to adapt
8876168 for the crowd and for the fans back at home its nice to see someone wind up and have a go
8876169 you dont mind taking shots on when its 50 50 but he was taking shots on which were 20 80 in his favour
8876170 i felt as if i was hitting the ball well but i missed a couple of balls i couldnt really believe
8876171 im happy though the conditions out there were first class ive criticised them in the past but i hold my hands up because theyve been superb it was good to get over the line
8876172 we want to move on and embrace every race in south africa
8876173 our figures show that 85 per cent of those wanting to join are black theyre fed up of corruption and the lack of support from the anc and want to join us in a non racial party which represents everyone not the few
8876174 were not going to be the party of p w botha we are going to be the party of f w de klerk who is still massively respected in south africa
8876175 the national party handed over a modern state to the anc in 1994 despite sanctions but now look at the country we need to tackle poverty from the ground up not with black empowerment deals which benefit the few
8876176 the majority black population will always associate them with apartheid and a sizeable proportion of the white population feel betrayed by them for negotiating with the anc to end apartheid i do not see them making waves
8876177 we want to be the underdog and are not bothered by the criticism we know what the feelings are on the ground
8876178 and he insists strongly that they should be accorded the respect they deserve if any team brings this determination and this will to succeed with them then they have a chance of progressing if you do have that kind of desire theres a chance that it will happen
8876179 you dont arrive in the last four of the all ireland series by mistake or some freak
8876180 you have to be there on merit so everybody in the last four is there on merit and each of them deserve the same respect thats the way it is
8876181 they have shown themselves to be a very hard working composed team with a lot of skill and experience
8876182 they will have taken a great deal from their wins over down and armagh and will certainly relish the challenge of facing us
8876183 for a county like wexford who people would say have no chance of winning an all ireland final the feeling is that it is even harder for us to bounce back following the leinster final defeat which we suffered
8876184 there are so many traditional counties out of the competition and we are still there all we have done is stick to our jobs and see what comes out
8876185 tyrone were certainly very good against dublin they were very efficient but the team in 2005 was a very young team so it doesnt surprise me to see a lot of those players still performing so well
8876186 stands for the right to strike by the working class as a fundamental right
8876187 in the context of certain remarks made by bhattacharjee in a meeting of assocham in kolkata
8876188 it has consistently supported all india general strikes of the trade unions against the neo liberal policies of the central government and other urgent issues of the working class and toiling people
8876189 i cannot afford to return the 400 acres if that land has to be returned then tata motors project has to be dropped i cannot allow this to happen

8876191 connecticut sen joe lieberman the democratic vice presidential pick in 2000 who is now an independent

8876193 they shouldnt be too pretty too smart or too competent for fear of scaring the boys away
8876194 we are very happy to be returning to omaha for another two years
8876195 we have a long history and a great tradition there and feel that it is a great home for us we appreciate the relationship with the ownership and feel that they are a first class operation

8876200 you just never know until actors get together but when i saw adam and josh in the rehearsal room i practically went on my knees to give thanks
8876201 im pretty sure adam feels the same way were playing brothers so its important we have that
8876202 at least thats what i feel if adam doesnt feel it hes a great enough actor to fake it
8876203 i havent worked with josh before but fortunately we have discovered we work in the same way we discovered that very quickly
8876204 im not really here to sell myself i understand that people are often very interested about private lives but im not a star im not a celebrity and i just think im not that interesting
8876205 i grew up near watford a sort of suburban commuter belt land my family had lots of relatives in north london and golders green my parents now retired were heavily involved in charity and the jewish community
8876206 semi secular but lets just say that i had enough of a feeling of a typical north london jewish community where two thousand years was set to be able to draw on it
8876207 then i made the mistake of having lunch with howard davies
8876208 the first preview of paul stepping out on to that stage was the most fear i have experienced walking out under rehearsed and under prepared thats the clich d actors nightmare you dont know who youre playing there are thousands of people sitting waiting for you to do something and you havent a clue
8876209 i would think wow this time last night i was in that world and now tonight but of course they were curiously linked in a strange not so tenuous way they were both jewish
8876210 waves that batter you when youre in a storm in your life
8876211 ive certainly had those thats probably as far as i would go
8876212 i just try really hard to be led by really good work
8876213 this is the book i wish i had four years ago thats when i faced the equally unpleasant tasks of fixing old broken gui tests and coaxing a rickety third party toolkit into running new tests i started looking for a how to guide on gui testing to help me down this road unfortunately there were none plenty of people had written beautifully about testing in general but not about user interfaces specifically what few gui books did exist were long dry restricted to technologies i couldnt use or built on test frameworks that looked like someones homework assignment
8876214 a third of all cases of cerebral palsy are associated with preterm birth
8876215 this study shows a significant reduction in cerebral palsy among preterm infants whose mothers were given magnesium sulfate
8876216 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to date that looked at using this inexpensive and commonly used treatment to reduce the occurrence of cerebral palsy after preterm birth
8876217 cerebral palsy cant always be prevented but the data from our study and its predecessors will help obstetricians make informed treatment decisions for the women under their care
8876218 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulfate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8876219 its certainly been a difficult year but buying out a partner is never an easy thing

8876257 one of the first patrols we went on was to go assess this pool
8876258 our contractor didnt want to drain the pool completely when kids are still using it so he was able to set it up so the kids could swim while construction was going on they were working 24 hours a day on the project
8876259 the perfect end state would be that the project becomes self sufficient it doesnt require any american influence to be able to continue
8876260 we want the community to have the ability to experience a part of childhood that every kid should have

8876275 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
8876276 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
8876277 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
8876278 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower

8876283 i dont even want to sulley this press conference by talking about him
8876284 i dont think i will ever get over how i think he treated me and my family i wasnt upset by the way it ended just by what was going on i have got absolutely no problem with west brom as a football club the supporters the players the staff just one person and a few people who work for him
8876285 there are a lot of memories but i wont be emotional from that point of view a lot of water has passed under the bridge since then
8876286 it is a fantastic football club and i had great times when i was there i got on fantastically with the supporters they were fantastic to me
8876287 but from my point of view it is about getting back on track and getting a good result
8876288 we were second bottom of the championship and just stayed up then 92 games later we were in the premier league for the first time in about 20 odd years
8876289 the football club didnt have a choice in the first season we went up because there was no finance there but when we went down and came straight back up again we did have choices it has been done step by step at west brom and at some point they are going to have to push on im sure they can do it is a huge football club
8876290 it is an entirely different job than when i was there
8876291 he has got finances but it doesnt make it any easier because there is a bit of expectation there now whereas there wasnt for me it was just a case of trying to keep a club up that had been treading water for 20 years and move them forward

8876302 even so i thought you had to have kekkei genkai to begin with
8876303 you already have a kekkei genkai and one of the strongest bloodlines around but with no one to teach you how to activate it or use it it just lay dormant now im going to teach you to activate and use it but first im going to make it even more powerful if you thought that the byakugan or the sharingan where strong yours will make them seem no better than normal eyesight in comparison
8876304 we went off at the end it was a big moment
8876305 thats why the last split time is really bad we didnt lose so much time but we were very lucky not to roll because the car went off the road and hit some big stones
8876306 i just hit the starter button and it didnt work
8876307 we tried everything in the end we rolled the car back pushed it and finally got it going it had nothing to do with tactics
8876308 i dont know what was wrong but seb really did seem to have a problem
8876309 so tomorrow it looks like ill be first car on the road okay it wont be easy but weve found a good rhythm today so well see what we can do

8876322 la coppa uefa ha unattrazione particolare ha detto a uefa com spesso si vede un calcio pi aperto e spettacolare e di solito ci sono squadre molto diverse provenienti dalle nazioni pi disparate per i tifosi delle squadre che vi partecipano una grande competizione europea basta guardare ai numeri per la mia nazione la scozia ci sono stati 150 000 tifosi dei rangers che hanno invaso manchester per la finale di maggio nessuno dovrebbe dire che si tratta di una competizione di secondo livello
8876323 penso che del lavoro sulla competizione fosse necessario molto importante e credo che presto inizieremo a raccogliere i primi frutti ma i veri benefici arriveranno con il cambiamento del format aboliremo la coppa intertoto uefa che ha completato la sua ultima edizione il nuovo format avr una fase a gironi simile a quella della champions league

8876346 ich glaube dass der superpokal mittlerweile als f nf sterne veranstaltung in monaco gesehen wird
8876347 monaco bekommt dadurch einen wirtschaftlichen schub genauso wie die angrenzenden gemeinden alle profitieren davon
8876348 f rst rainier iii wollte dieses spiel austragen denn dadurch wird monaco auf der ganzen welt bekannt die f rstenfamilie liebt den fu ball und besonders wie die menschen ber monaco als ziel f r die welt des fu balls sprechen
8876349 die organisation f r den n chsten superpokal beginnt mit dem schlusspfiff des vorangegangenen spiels
8876350 wir treffen uns schritt f r schritt mit den verschiedenen beh rden ehe die arbeit ab mai noch einmal zunimmt
8876351 monaco ist eine stadt in der die sicherheit sehr wichtig ist die menschen kommen voller freude ins stadion denn hier muss sich ein mann mit seinen kindern nicht vor ausschreitungen auf den trib nen f rchten in der heutigen zeit ist das sehr wichtig die leute wollen ins stadion kommen und ein fu ballspiel sehen und keine kampfszenen auf den r ngen
8876352 der grand prix hat uns f r die belange des fu balls enorm geholfen
8876353 der superpokal ist wie die organisation des grand prix nur in einem kleineren rahmen in sachen unterbringung der leute und bei den sicherheitsaspekten wir wissen dass diese auf dem h chsten niveau sind
8876354 wir organisieren im august an zwei fronten die spiele der franz sischen meisterschaft und den superpokal
8876355 beim superpokal habe ich die gelegenheit dinge zu sehen die ich in der meisterschaft nicht zu sehen bekomme
8876356 i wanted to be totally isolated to live by myself to form my own opinions and to make time i think people dont make time in their lives anymore
8876357 most people go to cities because the money is much better i wanted to go the opposite way to show them something different my goal is not to judge but just to experience something and share it with others
8876358 the big freedom for humans is being naked i think most of the time i will be naked or wearing a sarong i will have no limits there
8876359 everything you learn from the age of five is to enable you to live in this system when i go to tofua island most of the things i have learnt will not help me i have to switch off and learn new things and i think that will be very interesting
8876360 people say tongans are the happiest people in the world
8876361 most of them dont work if they need food they fish they have a totally different way of life to what we have here they all smile but when i go to geneva or bern at 8am i dont see many people smiling
8876362 if you are at peace with yourself i think you can live in many different situations for me i know there are going to be some very hard moments because i am leaving my girlfriend my sister my parents behind but i know that this experience has a beginning and an end
8876363 i dont think ill go crazy because im like a kid i like to discover all the time in ten months i have just enough time to see all of the island
8876364 we all have limits 99 9 per cent of people dont know what these limits are because they work at a desk get a big belly and the limits are going up 50 stairs without stopping
8876365 you find your limits and if you work at it you can slowly push them i have been snowboarding for 20 years now but an islands a totally different experience i will have to discover everything
8876366 its really important for me to show that i can live for 300 days without causing pollution but mainly i am doing it because i think it is nice to realise our dreams and this is one of mine
8876367 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush

8876370 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8876371 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8876372 until we gain access to the house and complete our search and examination we are not in a position to make any further comment on such issues
8876373 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved the afp said in a statement
8876374 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8876375 delighted at the news but wanted an apology from the government and as yet unspecified damages
8876376 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation mr hodgson said
8876377 a matter for further down the track after a federal government inquiry into the case
8876378 he still loves australia but no decision has been made about whether hell come back to australia and if so when
8876379 it is hard to know with the afp they dont deal with things with a straight bat he told the abc
8876380 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
8876381 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused he said
8876382 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position mr hodgson said
8876383 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated
8876384 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done greens leader bob brown said
8876385 but you couldnt blame him if he didnt want to risk it a second time
8876386 the last government owes both him and his country an apology it should come from john howard senator brown said
8876387 we made 2 or 3 key mistakes which really hurt us being shown the penalty flag 5 times didnt really help either but we felt we sailed well and are confident that we can bounce back tomorrow
8876388 we had a reasonable day i thought we sailed well as a team but felt we had a few decisions go against us the race we won was the one we really wanted against peter wibroe so i think we can go into tomorrow feeling positive

8876410 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8876411 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8876412 this suggestion should be seriously considered not just for dietary supplements but also for conventional foods
8876413 the area of trace elements in dietary supplements is one the association has dedicated time and attention to and through the work of our committees we will continue to assist ahpa companies in reaching their quality standards
8876414 products made by members of the american herbal product association capsules liquids pastes are less likely to contain toxic metals
8876415 products that have obtained seals of quality approval from consumer lab com and the united states pharmacopeia usp can be assumed to be free of significant levels of toxic metals
8876416 the commission has opened an own initiative investigation under eu antitrust rules into the intended co operation agreement between ba iberia and aa announced on 14th august
8876417 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future
8876418 the strategy i am launching today outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities

8876424 ik ben zeer tevreden met dit resultaat zeker als je weet dat ik al zolang niet meer met een rallywagen op onverhard terrein heb gereden
8876425 vanmorgen voelde de wagen niet zo goed aan tijdens de assistentie veranderde ik de afstelling waardoor ik wat meer overstuur kreeg ik groeide in de wedstrijd kreeg meer zelfvertrouwen in de laatste twee klassementsritten van de dag gebruikte ik teveel moeten remmen waardoor ik op een bepaald ogenblik geen voorste remmen meer had los van dat had ik geen technische problemen

8876428 het is een wonder want ook die haak had fataal kunnen zijn voor het kind
8876429 the approach to matches remains the same from within this season it is purely one game at a time and that is all we focus on the aim is to finish in a good position in league two this season we proved what we can do last time around and there is no reason why we cannot do it again
8876430 im getting frustrated with the whole situation now and the lads were told in no uncertain terms im getting a little bit tired now of individual errors because we do our homework on clubs we face and we put a team out to win that specific game
8876431 its not all about training and listening to me gab on and taking the information in its about actually taking it on board and doing what is asked but until we do that im obviously going to get the flak and they are not going to move on as a group
8876432 there is a distinct lack of confidence and we are not playing the football we know we can play but there is a glimmer of hope
8876433 there is a definite desire and passion to win games we have played some good teams but there is nothing in this league at all and once we find that first win we will move forward
8876434 the league is our bread and butter and what matters is our game against shrewsbury this weekend
8876435 wigan are a very good team and if you live in the real world then youre not going to come up here and beat them but im very proud of the boys and im hopeful that with the right backing we can build a real infrastructure to move forward and progress
8876436 we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire

8876446 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8876447 its nokia microsoft maps on satellite navigation tools its diluting the quality of the graphic image that we call a map
8876448 the sco energy club offers immense possibilities and solutions and india as a developing economy would be willing to engage with sco countries
8876449 i am confronted with a difficult energy scenario closely associated with global trends which impinges on our developmental targets the sco could take a lead in evolving a constructive partnership among the energy producing and energy consuming nations
8876450 this has given us greater capacity to engage and strengthen our commitment for working together with the countries of the sco
8876451 creo que la supercopa se considera ahora como un evento de cinco estrellas en m naco es un impulso econ mico para la ciudad y para todos los municipios cercanos y as todos ganan
8876452 el pr ncipe rainiero iii quer a organizar este partido porque hace que m naco sea conocido en todo el mundo la familia real ama el f tbol y especialmente c mo la gente habla de m naco ya que se convierte en un destino para el mundo del f tbol
8876453 la organizaci n de la pr xima supercopa comienza en el momento en que el anterior partido termina poco a poco las reuniones se llevan a cabo con los distintos servicios p blicos y el trabajo se acelera a partir de mayo
8876454 el p blico est entusiasmado con el f tbol aqu m naco es una ciudad donde la seguridad es muy importante y la gente viene al estadio con gusto porque el espectador puede sentarse con sus hijos a sabiendas de que no habr problemas en las gradas esto es crucial en el momento actual para ir a un estadio a ver un partido de f tbol y no ver combates en las gradas
8876455 el gran premio nos ha ayudado enormemente en lo que respecta al f tbol la supercopa es la organizaci n del gran premio a escala reducida en t rminos de dar la bienvenida y acogida de las personas y en los aspectos de seguridad y sabemos que estos tienen que ser al m s alto nivel
8876456 organizamos en dos niveles en agosto con el campeonato franc s y la supercopa los partidos de la supercopa me permiten ver cosas que no puedo ver en un encuentro de liga
8876457 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus

8876461 many low tech industries squeezed by shrinking margins and severe credit constraints are closing down
8876462 were seeing a situation where in the steel industry for instance transport costs can make a difference between made in china and made in the u s american companies are doing the math and shifting some businesses from china and if energy prices remain high as we believe they will youll see more and more industries leaving china
8876463 china no longer wants to be the manufacturing capital of the world
8876464 it wants to be the added value production capital of the world
8876465 its not just that china has superior infrastructure and a huge supply base increasingly firms are manufacturing not just for export but for the china market
8876466 high oil prices will reverse globalization and alter the geography of manufacturing
8876467 soaring transport costs suggest trade should be both dampened and diverted as markets seek shorter and hence less costly supply lines instead of finding cheap labor halfway across the world the key will be to find the cheapest labor force within reasonable shipping distance to your market
8876468 we believe that oil prices will remain elevated and in fact go higher again
8876469 its not a question of tomorrow its a long term story we believe theres a major disagreement between supply and demand therefore energy prices will remain elevated and go higher which in turn means transport prices will become more and important for companies
8876470 our existing clients in china all of whom are foreign invested companies are asking us to go to india not necessarily to shut down their manufacturing operations in china but to take advantage of the fact that theres a large market in india
8876471 you come to china to do one or two things one manufacture here for export and thats starting to get a bit expensive which is why low end guys are shifting to vietnam
8876472 or you come here to manufacture and sell onto the domestic market and thats where the future money is the same is true of india
8876473 a lot of people talk about the bureaucracy in india and its impact on business development
8876474 but although politics and bureaucracy does hold up certain processes you can go to india and establish a business in a relatively short time scale in fact the processes to set up a representative office in india are actually two steps less than it takes in china
8876475 where else but in china can you source the huge quantity of goods that wal mart needs for instance
8876476 countries like vietnam and bangladesh may be able to take some market share from china in some industries but theyre not going to be able to replicate the huge scale of manufacturing that china has built up over the past 30 years
8876477 in low end manufacturing which is labor intensive and materials intensive china is not going to be as competitive as it once was
8876478 china is clearly shifting its priorities from quantity to quality and it can be selective over which industries to welcome and which ones to restrict
8876479 the region is taking certain low end manufacturing away from china
8876480 thats partly beijings policies partly economic reality vietnam is cheaper to manufacture certain goods than shenzhen or dongguan is but if you go to vietnam then there are people there telling you its cheaper still in laos and cambodia
8876481 theres also a regional shift for the global manufacturers looking for new markets
8876482 penetration in china to sell to china will continue however theres the huge india market to consider also the smaller countries of southeast asia will progressively absorb low cost manufacturing while india is becoming a domestic market that cannot be ignored
8876483 where you want to manufacture and export and where you want to manufacture and sell onto has changed there are an increasing number of options regionally which is why we are running around assessing them
8876484 the question of when human life begins is beyond my pay grade
8876485 we want to reduce the number of abortions all of us want to reduce the number of abortions

8876500 let me start at the end there is no more fineman and skinny indeed they managed to get past the joint services
8876501 in any event these were hard men hard fighters in the end the joint services won we won out and it is not over as the commissioner said because there are other criminal elements at large the joint services continue to conduct its operation and work towards keeping the country safe i dont see a let up of this operation for the joint services

8876504 there was a mistake in a recipe for apple cake instead of calling for two pinches of nutmeg it said 20 nutmeg nuts were needed
8876505 we know that four adults ate one cake made from this recipe and they didnt feel well
8876506 at first we thought this would be enough because we didnt really think anyone would bake or eat this cake since so much nutmeg would give it a horrible bitter taste and because it is simply not that easy to get hold of that much nutmeg
8876507 after i used it for three days all of my acne dried up and went away
8876508 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
8876509 after that my friends who work at garment factories in phnom penh advised me to apply the lubricant from number one plus condoms on my face every night
8876510 and just within three to four nights the acne on my face gradually and then totally disappeared
8876511 performance across the board has been disappointing this year and the difference between nav and share price performance gives you an idea of how premiums have evaporated and discounts widened
8876512 they have held up pretty well in nav terms but investors are exposed to the share price and it makes a big difference to returns
8876513 the price is driven by supply and demand and in the first quarter particularly a lot of investors were de risking their portfolios and the premium people have been willing to pay has been less and less
8876514 kids with odd have frequent temper tantrums and argue constantly with adults
8876515 performance across the board has been disappointing this year and the difference between nav and share price performance gives you an idea of how premiums have evaporated and discounts widened

8876521 anyone who had taken the time to look could have seen in his eyes there was something wrong
8876522 ballina is a great little town but where is the community spirit
8876523 when the size of a group increases you get a diffusion of responsibility
8876524 people feel self onscious or think there might be someone else who can cope with the situation better than themselves from the research on this subject you cant make any generalisations about the type of person who will take action in this sort of situation it is not apathy or callousness that prevents people from acting often they are taking passive cues from others or it is the ambiguity of the situation that inhibits people
8876525 i dont know how long he was in this position before i got there but i do know there were at least three male adults and one female adult that walked straight by and did not offer assistance
8876526 shame on you you know who you are and you should be absolutely disgusted in yourself lets hope you never find yourself in a vulnerable position and require help
8876527 i must say i felt apprehensive going to help i didnt know if he was drink or drug affected or whether he would come up swinging but the point is he was a human being and he needed help i would hope if i ever needed this kind of help someone would stop for me
8876528 there are five main areas that we assess at each workplace from energy consumption through to recycling but the whole process is voluntary so its up to each business if they want to take on our suggestions
8876529 its all well and good to have these grand ideas but we need to know what we can do
8876530 i want him to pack into the first scrum so we can get it out of the way early
8876531 i know from when we were sparring together that ive got his measure
8876532 ive got one reply to that i saw him after their ballina game when he looked like the elephant man he leads with his nose
8876533 gibbo is the best sledger in the game and hes got a big arse
8876534 they knocked us out last year so it would be good to get some revenge

8876536 im not going to lie i stole some gum i stole a lot of gum actually i was a rookie at valeting cars
8876537 i was studying broadcast journalism but i just could not find my niche so i took a semester off and to earn some money i was valeting cars in the meantime i certainly earned that gum
8876538 the iemma government has redeveloped the mental health unit and is working on the new integrated cancer centre the next stage of the lismore master plan now at risk would deliver a new clinical services block which would expand the emergency department expand surgery and intensive care units and add additional ambulance services
8876539 its the lowest order of blackmail that ive ever experienced when health service and people are threatened and put at risk like this
8876540 it just shows their arrogance theyve treated country and regional people who have the most to lose out of the privatisation of power with contempt
8876541 we were advised well before there was even any debate about electricity that it wasnt on any plan anyway
8876542 now they are saying there is a black whole in the budget it wasnt even in the budget
8876543 when we were fighting to maintain the rehabilitation centre at lismore it was made clear that stage three would happen
8876544 now heres reba meagher trying to hold the people of the northern rivers and their health services to ransom because the opposition didnt support their privatisation of power
8876545 every other bill that has come before the house since ive been elected has gone through on party lines so how can she blame the opposition
8876546 i am not a gym person at all and the most exercise i get when im not working is when i get up to turn on the radio to listen to the football and im yelling for west ham united
8876547 i think that gym work is so boring and repetitive and the thought of a diet makes me want to go and stuff myself with chips and cream
8876548 byron bay is a very strong local community which takes pride in the area
8876549 we believe the support that is inherent in byron will allow us to turn the byron bay cup into one of the premium races on the northern rivers racing calendar
8876550 we are going to consult with all stakeholders after the sunday meeting to see if everybody is happy to continue with the program or go back to june again
8876551 we see considerable advantages in keeping it to the end of august you have longer days and can put more events on
8876552 also for the racing community were trying to build it up to running in conjunction as a carnival with ballina
8876553 we found it surprising that previously approved funding for a facility that would have such a positive impact on disadvantaged young people and local families has been withdrawn
8876554 i met with gary gray in canberra to ask him to intervene but he says he cant as he has to stay at arms length from the decision and has accepted the departments advice

8876671 i think its normal that a player says that he wants to leave and in the case of robinho i accept that as being totally normal it seems to me that its a mistake but its his problem
8876672 i think that his representatives are advising him very badly and i have a lot of faith in the lad i believe he has a lot of quality and could be successful here but i say it again that i have to defend the interests of this club in the best manner possible

8876812 ik sprak laatst met ricky hoogendorp en die is over een maandje weer terug dus met die voorhoede zit het wel goed het middenveld is niet sterk genoeg je kan allemaal wel naar voren rennen maar het is zo kloten dat je ook weer naar achteren moet daardoor valt dat hele middenveld van ado altijd open voor de tegenstander
8876813 uiteindelijk is hij wel de juiste man voor deze taak al was zijn opdracht eerst anders de gedachte was dat hij ado terug moest brengen naar de eredivisie nu zijn we door een paar frommelgoals gepromoveerd en moet hij meteen met de billen bloot de vraag is of hij ook in staat is om het elftal omhoog te stuwen maar met een beetje haagse bluf moet het lukken als je rolt moet je ook doorrollen
8876814 zeventiende en dus nacompetitie om eerlijk te zijn ik heb de ploeg deze voorbereiding niet zien spelen maar wel twee keer naar het verslag van radio west geluisterd het was kommer en kwel wat willem van zuilen te vertellen had afgelopen zondag tegen real sociead bovendien ik ben ook niet zo ondersteboven van de aankopen die ado den haag heeft gedaan ik hoop trouwens wel dat ik het mis heb want ik gun de club het allerbeste
8876815 kan ik moeilijk beoordelen maar ik vind wel dat je hem een kans moet geven je moet in dit geval ook kijken naar de kwaliteit van zijn selectie en de financi le power van de club als je kunt kopen wat je wilt kun je daar later op worden afgerekend als marco van basten of huub stevens na dit seizoen vierde of vijfde wordt met ajax en psv kun je zeggen dat ze zwaar gefaald hebben met wetzel ligt dat anders vind ik
8876816 allereerst hoop ik dat ze de nacompetitie ontlopen maar ik verwacht niet dat dat lukt sla de lijstjes er maar op na clubs die promoveren spelen bijna altijd nacompetitie of degraderen meteen behalve nac in 2001 maar ik speelde dan ook in dat elftal haha maar ik blijf positief ado moet volendam de graafschap en heracles onder zich kunnen houden dan worden ze vijftiende
8876817 elke linie kan wel versterking gebruiken maar centraal achterin is ado het zwakst als chris kum fit is heeft ado geen probleem maar rankovic is geen centrale verdediger en voor die horv th had ado echt niet naar slowakije gehoeven
8876818 het is een goede zaak dat er nu iemand uit de regio voor het team staat het publiek kan dat wel waarderen maar zelfs johan cruijff zal het als ado trainer niet beter doen dan wetzel je bent toch afhankelijk van je materiaal
8876819 vijftiende al zal dat nog lastig genoeg worden ado heeft tijd nodig om iets op te bouwen en juist die tijd heb je niet in de eredivisie
8876820 nergens loopt ado echt over van kwaliteit dat is wel duidelijk die caracciolo heeft het goed gedaan bij eindhoven maar schiet ze er eerst maar eens in in de eredivisie ammi ook nooit een vaste waarde geweest bij nac
8876821 forsvaret skal naturligvis have mulighed for hurtigt at etablere realistiske tr ningsfaciliteter og situationer p milit re velsesterr ner uden b vl og bureaukratiske forhindringer alt andet er absurd

8876835 they can no longer hold themselves back from being who they are

8876840 an economic and political system in which a countrys trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit rather than by the state
8876841 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8876842 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it
8876843 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8876844 why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension
8876845 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it
8876846 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is
8876847 he is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8876848 in retrospect we could definitely have bettered it ill say that straight up

8876872 as part of the project we intend to advance the technology to get it ready for the market soon
8876873 wherever telematics infrastructures are built additional services emerge sooner or later building on this infrastructure and presenting an enormous added value at a fraction of the initial cost one example is the internet and the value added services we are now used to such as e mail portals and webshops the risk that user profiles can be generated without the user wanting them to be generated does pose a latent problem the convenient use of various pseudo identities is an interesting approach to solving the problem of widespread undesired profile generation i think the turbine project promises to bring important impulses in this regard
8876874 wir werden im rahmen des projektes die technologie soweit vorantreiben dass sie schnell marktreife erlangt
8876875 berall dort wo telematische infrastrukturen aufgebaut werden entstehen fr her oder sp ter zus tzliche dienste die auf diese infrastruktur aufsetzen und zu einem bruchteil der initialen kosten einen enormen mehrwert darstellen ein beispiel daf r sind das internet und die heute g ngigen mehrwertdienste wie e mail portale und webshops die gefahr der vom nutzer ungewollten profilbildung stellt dabei allerdings ein latentes problem dar die komfortable verwendung von unterschiedlichen pseudo identit ten bietet einen interessanten ansatz zur l sung des problems der bergreifenden und ungewollten profilbildung ich verspreche mir von dem turbine projekt diesbez gliche wichtige impulse

8876887 we spent just three months working on very limited resources to conduct an enquiry the implementation should be fast so that the interests of the people are safeguarded
8876888 almost all suspects are government employees and i wonder why its taking so long for them to be brought to justice because the laws are there
8876889 we have seen good intention on the part of the government we now want to see implementation of the recommendations expedited he added that the decision by those adversely named in the probe report to resign from their posts was not enough and that further action needed to be taken this is a matter which shook the government to its core it is not an issue to be swept under the carpet just like that it must be accorded the importance it deserves
8876890 the problem here is that the government is taking too long to act it should act decisively against all those involved in the scandal
8876891 silence on the part of the government and its failure to make their defences public creates the impression that something is being hidden from the public it possible that some of them might have been forced to by the superiors to give the dead the green light
8876892 that the government has started working on the probe report shows that government is now taking the matter seriously
8876893 it is a good starting point we feel that this move has a lot to do with strengthening the rule of law and accountability in our country
8876894 the government seems to have a good intention and has started working on the teams recommendations im very optimistic that the final verdict will be just
8876895 we performed our job with great care and integrity and were guided by one principle the quest to unearth the truth
8876896 time has come for the tanzanian private sector to target the regional market instead of concentrating efforts on the far away markets of europe and america that are more difficult to penetrate

8876898 if one of my daughters boyfriends turns out to be vegetarian i swear to god id never forgive them
8876899 my biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said dad im a vegetarian then i would sit them on the fence and electrocute them
8876900 i think its a case of live and let live i will talk to people about the advantages of vegetarianism and it will upset me if weve had a good conversation and they turn around and say something stupid
8876901 i just read a quote from gordon ramsay if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her but even that i would forgive because its not my affair its not up to me if he talks stupid or not
8876902 id be happier if everyone was vegetarian the planet would be better off for it

8876917 shes happy all the time and everyone looks to her
8876918 she definitely brings a feeling of teamsmanship to the team
8876919 it would have to be an extraordinary situation for england manager martin johnson to come to us recommending a league player and for us to sign him
8876920 weve made it very clear that our policy is not to recruit league players
8876921 thats because of the structure in terms of how were funding the clubs and the top end of the game
8876922 it would have to be an extraordinary situation for england manager martin johnson to come to us recommending a league player and for us to sign him
8876923 but if there was a player like that then its very likely that he would not already have been signed by a gloucester or bath
8876924 thats because these players are being shifted around the marketplace the whole time
8876925 we do get players who make mistakes in terms of where they move and when they move we have to deal with agents in the game now
8876926 if he wenger said to us i want this guy and hes 30 million can i buy him the answer is yes absolutely yes
8876927 there were great expectations and hopes that we would buy heavily this summer
8876928 its not our decision who he wenger spends money on nor will it ever be our decision
8876929 if he said to us i want this guy and hes 30 million can i buy him the answer is yes absolutely yes
8876930 we totally back him its his decision if arsene found the right player he would buy that player but at the moment he hasnt

8876932 i think as mothers with the music and the media out there we really have to sit our boys down and tell them that is not okay
8876933 to teach my sons a different thought process when it comes to how they view women
8876934 its funny because i remember telling my kids mommy isnt going to be doing any more movies this year you know what they said but how are we going to pay the bills it was cute but more important they see a household where both parents contribute
8876935 the dvd is tucked away we met the governor we had the jackets the parade the dinner etc etc all of that was important but its yesterdays news
8876936 im worried about september our early schedule is very tough
8876937 finishing in the top eight would be great were looking for a home playoff game but until we play together you dont know
8876938 our opener against campbell will be a good test for us
8876939 if we hold our own against campbell it should be a good season for us
8876940 we have two boys in the palumbos that are playing at a higher level than most of the kids in the united states
8876941 steve is in the top 25 in the national pool and robbie is in the top 100 or 200
8876942 when you have two kids on the field like that the level of play comes up and everyone tries to emulate them you have to be careful to not get caught watching them but helping them
8876943 the higher level players have to be patient and let the other kids skills come up
8876944 all these kids are excellent athletes so we have to wait for them to gain touch and decision making ability in order to be a cohesive unit
8876945 the same sort of thing happened last year where we just tried to make it cohesive team unit where you have a diversity of players from kids nationally ranked to those who are seasonal players
8876946 another strength we have is the leadership of our captain josh diburro
8876947 he makes sure the work rate is up gives pep talks and adds to our continuity we have the quiet elite leadership of steve and rob palumbo and the vocal active leadership of josh diburro
8876948 we were just a bounce or two away from the semifinals
8876949 my hope is we will play to our potential and grow as each game is played with controlled possession with great patience and skill
8876950 i know this team is capable because they get better each day and with each practice
8876951 this team plays very well together and trusts each other on and off the field if you have team chemistry like this anything is possible during the season and when the playoffs begin
8876952 a phone is only as good as the network its on
8876953 i see maturity from last year to this year theyre setting the tone for the group and theyve done a nice job so far

8877008 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8877009 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8877010 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8877011 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8877012 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

8877015 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8877016 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8877017 todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso
8877018 en chile no hay presos pol ticos las personas que est n privadas de libertad todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso
8877019 se alaba que las c rceles concesionadas visit santiago 1 y rancagua est n en la primera l nea de lo que l ha visto en el continente no solamente en sudam rica
8877020 no hay en ning n caso en chile pr ctica de torturas ni en ning n caso permisividad o complacencia o hacer la vista a un lado en caso de malos tratos si es necesario son investigados y sancionados si corresponde
8877021 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8877022 m s que una carta pastoral es un libro con toda la fundamentaci n de datos y lo importante es que es la intervenci n de una figura de iglesia con preocupaci n por la tica
8877023 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8877024 la escuela en un alto grado es una fuente de cultivo para el racismo la discriminaci n la negaci n de todo lo mapuche
8877025 los derechos educativos y ling sticos son parte importante de los derechos colectivos de nuestro pueblo naci n mapuche reconocidos por la legislaci n internacional en varios instrumentos convenio 169 oit convenci n de los derechos del ni o declaraci n de diversidad cultural unesco declaraci n de la onu derechos pueblos ind genas y que en el proyecto lge del gobierno no son expresados reflejando una vez mas la sistem tica pol tica de violaci n a nuestros derechos pol ticos como pueblo naci n mapuche por parte de la institucionalidad racista del estado chileno
8877026 disminuye la cantidad de hablantes y se interrumpe el aprendizaje por las nuevas ge ne ra ciones
8877027 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
8877028 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8877029 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8877030 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8877031 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
8877032 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
8877033 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8877034 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8877035 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8877036 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8877037 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8877038 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
8877039 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8877040 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
8877041 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
8877042 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
8877043 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8877044 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8877045 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8877046 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8877047 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8877048 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8877049 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8877050 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8877063 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8877064 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8877065 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8877066 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8877067 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8877068 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8877069 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8877070 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas

8877072 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8877077 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8877078 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche

8877093 we know that president obama will end the war in iraq responsibly bring our tr former virginia governor mark warner gave the
8877094 this race is all about the future thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president because the race for the future the race for the future will be partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemate and when hope replaces fear
8877095 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8877096 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8877097 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8877098 we know that president obama will end the war in iraq responsibly bring our troops home and begin to repair our alliances around the world

8877104 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best idea l and to elect barack obama president of the u s
8877105 what he can do is be open and honest and i guess id like to use the word sensitive to the feeling s of all of the people who supported hillary

8877115 had westerners become certain that the resolutions would bring us down to our knees they would have definitely intensified the sanctions
8877116 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8877117 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture
8877118 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter

8877120 once a view is taken on this level of ambition we develop a proposal on the distribution of the global effort amongst countries that has a reasonable chance of success
8877121 i dont think you can come into a state like ohio and have any success at all with a complete free trade policy and lack of concern about the downside of globalization
8877122 this is an issue that would play very very well with a demographic he needs to pick up
8877123 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta
8877124 democrats have to tread lightly because bill clinton was in the white house when nafta passed
8877125 the nafta stuff will in fact come back into the campaign dramatically
8877126 its a contrast that makes a great deal of difference in key states such as ohio pennsylvania and michigan
8877127 to be part of his 300th game on the weekend will be awesome
8877128 i just hope we can reward him with a win
8877129 it would have been ideal for me to finish with the club playing good football but i guess thats football isnt it
8877130 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that
8877131 as far as im concerned the liberal party leadership is a team of dr nelson and julie bishop and im supporting them
8877132 i intend to keep on serving the people of higgins
8877133 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8877134 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8877135 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament
8877136 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
8877137 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them
8877138 we felt that people in the australian market were also doing this but there were inconsistencies in the way it was being done
8877139 there is a certain amount of inconsistency in the way forward information is being reported but the difficulty is that you are looking for people to subscribe to a set of non binding principles
8877140 the accounting conventions youve used to arrive at the reported profit many people would have philosophical arguments about different approaches
8877141 earnings are just one input to a valuation decision an analyst would also look at the sustainability of net operating cashflow competitive dynamics management teams legal and regulatory changes things like that
8877142 to aspire for a legally binding calculation would not be in keeping with the principles based approach to reporting information to shareholders and other stakeholders
8877143 if you go down the prescriptive securities and exchange commission type of approach then ultimately your ability to keep up with innovation is hampered
8877144 principle based regulation has trumped prescription every time highly prescriptive mechanisms are always going to be in catch up mode
8877145 if we can resolve the debate about what constitutes an appropriate adjustment and achieve greater consistency the opportunity for confusion will decrease
8877146 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8877147 we have come here to get them to acknowledge the court order
8877148 if there is no reaction the police will have to do something
8877149 we will not let anyone control our fate we will write our fate on our own
8877150 five thousand protesters virtually blocked access to the phuket international airport so passengers cannot get in or out
8877151 he is not in the intensive care unit he is in a reserved room
8877152 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8877153 the main driver for the more modest gdp outcome for the quarter is likely to be weak household consumption
8877154 we are looking for quite a flat picture for consumption
8877155 we have higher interest rates and the credit crunch biting
8877156 export volumes have been surprisingly strong given the australian dollar and we have seen the volumes of imports soften in response to softening domestic demand
8877157 the equipment side of things that feeds the gdp number
8877158 thats makes some discussion of a negative outcome for the gdp number no longer relevant
8877159 finchys a big loss to them i dont think anyone can steer away from that fact
8877160 there hasnt too many times that i can remember brett hasnt been a part of their team and he is the spearhead of their attack
8877161 hes very vocal and one of their main motivators but as a desperate team im sure therell be a lot of them willing to step up
8877162 i wouldnt imagine parramattas going to go out and try and do a lot of things drastically different its hard to change things at this stage of the year
8877163 in these times other good players are born and its our job to make sure that young kris best game is not this week the same with feleti mateo hopefully we can do some things to nullify them a little bit and then next week they can come good
8877164 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8877165 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8877166 bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8877167 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8877168 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8877169 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8877170 people of every creed and colour from every walk of life
8877171 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8877172 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8877173 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8877174 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8877175 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8877176 the republicans are going to have their turn and theyll have a whole lot of fun with us and they will change some minds and persuade and then the race is on
8877177 were going to have to work as hard as we can
8877178 theres a board meeting on september 12 and im pretty confident it will get through
8877179 from my point of view theyd be crazy not to give him what he wants
8877180 hes got a winning formula and a very good team around him
8877181 we are a bit short of bodies with stuey musialik suspended
8877182 it might be worth a change to put johnny there why not
8877183 johnny was keen when he was on crutches so thats important and its good that he is keen
8877184 ive been training well and im feeling good but its up to kossie when he wants me to play
8877185 im just looking forward to making my debut whether its this one or the following one against newcastle
8877186 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8877187 we have come here to get them to acknowledge the court order
8877188 if there is no reaction the police will have to do something
8877189 we will not let anyone control our fate we will write our fate on our own
8877190 five thousand protesters virtually blocked access to the phuket international airport so passengers cannot get in or out
8877191 quando lho conosciuto ero ossessionata da un altro e non gli ho dato molto peso poi il nostro rapporto cresciuto e io mi sono innamorata di lui ma ho dovuto mettere una fine alla nostra storia perch lui doveva trasferirsi per lavoro ora per non riesco a cancellarlo dalla mia mente perch nessuno riusce a farmi sentire come faceva lui
8877192 more than 100 000 people fall victim to identity fraud each year and as technology advances so too are techniques identity fraudsters are incredibly inventive and are constantly finding new ways to rip you off so it is well worth doing all you can to protect your personal details
8877193 it is a sad fact that we have to be so protective over our details but thats just the way it is if you fail to do these things you are putting yourself at risk to those who make a living through fraud
8877194 all you can do is be as careful as possible and keep a constant eye on your finances that way if anything does happen you can get it put right as soon as possible rather than being slack and risking losing thousands stumbleupon
8877195 the political imperatives are understood but if there is to be action against the commissioner it has got to be lawful that means following due process by mpa under the regulations
8877196 if the nuclear button is pressed expect it to be crawled over for legal flaws
8877197 the commissioner has stated that he would co operate fully with the inquiry and we are extremely disappointed and concerned that the leaking of selected material to the media is capable of undermining due process
8877198 these projects cannot succeed and be sustainable unless the community mobilises and contributes considerably so that they feel like owners of the project

8877206 i dont think you can come into a state like ohio and have any success at all with a complete free trade policy and lack of concern about the downside of globalization
8877207 this is an issue that would play very very well with a demographic he needs to pick up
8877208 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta
8877209 democrats have to tread lightly because bill clinton was in the white house when nafta passed
8877210 the nafta stuff will in fact come back into the campaign dramatically
8877211 its a contrast that makes a great deal of difference in key states such as ohio pennsylvania and michigan
8877212 long road ahead but i think its definitely a good start
8877213 we pray that for all of us this is a point from which we can move forward and truly begin to heal
8877214 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8877215 we have come here to get them to acknowledge the court order
8877216 if there is no reaction the police will have to do something
8877217 we will not let anyone control our fate we will write our fate on our own
8877218 five thousand protesters virtually blocked access to the phuket international airport so passengers cannot get in or out
8877219 you will still be able to upgrade to later ie8 builds as they become available but you wont be able to uninstall them
8877220 while you can have a philosophical argument about putting an application in the os there are still a lot of low level hooks between the two
8877221 they increased that with ie 7 because ie 6 was notoriously insecure so this is one of those things where they are trying to do whats right and you got some lock in
8877222 late on thursday manchester city told rcd espanyol that it was ready to pay the buy out clause for argentine pablo zabaleta
8877223 up to the last minute espanyol tried to convince zabaleta to remain in barcelona but the defender was determined to continue his career in the premier league
8877224 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term
8877225 we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats
8877226 an increase of 131 1 million in total expenditure was only partly offset by an increase of 56 5 million in recurrent revenue

8877230 america we are better than the last eight years we are a better country than this
8877231 a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8877232 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8877233 obama also delivered plenty of red meat going on the attack against republican presidential candidate sen john mccain even as he delivered details regarding his own agenda on issues ranging from the economy to taxes
8877234 likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8877235 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8877236 listen now i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8877237 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8877238 democrats and republicans and independents have fought together and bled together and some have died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8877239 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8877240 you only have so many and he has to bring that hit record again the new version
8877241 you look at all those who came before us and died for the right to vote
8877242 racism is alive and well in america but we also have to recognize that were moving forward
8877243 here im feeling a sense of optimism when you see that obama won in iowa in states where they said hed never win then you have to admit the country is changing and we have to recognize the gains that weve made
8877244 a prominent philadelphia attorney and hillary clinton supporter filed suit this afternoon in the u s district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against illinois sen barack obama the democratic national committee and the federal election commission the action seeks an injunction preventing the senator from continuing his candidacy and a court order enjoining the dnc from nominating him next week all on grounds that sen obama is constitutionally ineligible to run for and hold the office of president of the united states
8877245 philip berg the filing attorney is a former gubernatorial and senatorial candidate former chair of the democratic party in montgomery pa county former member of the democratic state committee and former deputy attorney general of pennsylvania according to berg he filed the suit just days before the dnc is to hold its nominating convention in denver for the health of the democratic party i filed this action at this time berg stated to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
8877246 berg cited a number of unanswered questions regarding the illinois senators background and in todays lawsuit maintained that sen obama is not a natural born u s citizen or that if he ever was he lost his citizenship when he was adopted in indonesia berg also cites what he calls dual loyalties due to his citizenship and ties with kenya and indonesia even if sen obama can prove his u s citizenship berg stated citing the senators use of a birth certificate from the state of hawaii verified as a forgery by three independent document forensic experts the issue of multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries remains on the table
8877247 it is expected to take several days to carry out the search because of the scale of the buildings and the extent of the devastation
8877248 there must have been at least three seats to this fire given the vast area it covered and the distances between the destroyed buildings
8877249 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8877250 scenes of crime officers have already carried out examinations at the various outhouses
8877251 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8877252 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers
8877253 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8877255 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8877256 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8877260 from my point of view theyd be crazy not to give him what he wants
8877261 hes got a winning formula and a very good team around him
8877262 we are a bit short of bodies with stuey musialik suspended
8877263 it might be worth a change to put johnny there why not
8877264 johnny was keen when he was on crutches so thats important and its good that he is keen
8877265 ive been training well and im feeling good but its up to kossie when he wants me to play
8877266 im just looking forward to making my debut whether its this one or the following one against newcastle
8877267 once a view is taken on this level of ambition we develop a proposal on the distribution of the global effort amongst countries that has a reasonable chance of success
8877268 he is not in the intensive care unit he is in a reserved room
8877269 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8877270 the main driver for the more modest gdp outcome for the quarter is likely to be weak household consumption
8877271 we are looking for quite a flat picture for consumption
8877272 we have higher interest rates and the credit crunch biting
8877273 export volumes have been surprisingly strong given the australian dollar and we have seen the volumes of imports soften in response to softening domestic demand
8877274 the equipment side of things that feeds the gdp number
8877275 thats makes some discussion of a negative outcome for the gdp number no longer relevant
8877276 we felt that people in the australian market were also doing this but there were inconsistencies in the way it was being done
8877277 there is a certain amount of inconsistency in the way forward information is being reported but the difficulty is that you are looking for people to subscribe to a set of non binding principles
8877278 the accounting conventions youve used to arrive at the reported profit many people would have philosophical arguments about different approaches
8877279 earnings are just one input to a valuation decision an analyst would also look at the sustainability of net operating cashflow competitive dynamics management teams legal and regulatory changes things like that
8877280 to aspire for a legally binding calculation would not be in keeping with the principles based approach to reporting information to shareholders and other stakeholders
8877281 if you go down the prescriptive securities and exchange commission type of approach then ultimately your ability to keep up with innovation is hampered
8877282 principle based regulation has trumped prescription every time highly prescriptive mechanisms are always going to be in catch up mode
8877283 if we can resolve the debate about what constitutes an appropriate adjustment and achieve greater consistency the opportunity for confusion will decrease
8877284 the reconstruction of the group is progressing however the business remains in a fragile position and the continued market weakness is making the task difficult
8877285 were relying on them to look through our brand wed hope theyd put money in but its too early to say
8877286 when the credit crisis hit we were in transition from a balance sheet investor to a funds manager
8877287 the ubiquitous use of debt is a thing of the past
8877288 finchys a big loss to them i dont think anyone can steer away from that fact
8877289 there hasnt too many times that i can remember brett hasnt been a part of their team and he is the spearhead of their attack
8877290 hes very vocal and one of their main motivators but as a desperate team im sure therell be a lot of them willing to step up
8877291 i wouldnt imagine parramattas going to go out and try and do a lot of things drastically different its hard to change things at this stage of the year
8877292 in these times other good players are born and its our job to make sure that young kris best game is not this week the same with feleti mateo hopefully we can do some things to nullify them a little bit and then next week they can come good
8877293 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8877294 we have come here to get them to acknowledge the court order
8877295 if there is no reaction the police will have to do something

8877297 five thousand protesters virtually blocked access to the phuket international airport so passengers cannot get in or out
8877298 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8877299 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8877300 bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8877301 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8877302 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8877303 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8877304 people of every creed and colour from every walk of life
8877305 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8877306 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8877307 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8877308 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8877309 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8877310 the republicans are going to have their turn and theyll have a whole lot of fun with us and they will change some minds and persuade and then the race is on
8877311 were going to have to work as hard as we can
8877312 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8877313 we have come here to get them to acknowledge the court order
8877314 if there is no reaction the police will have to do something
8877315 we will not let anyone control our fate we will write our fate on our own
8877316 five thousand protesters virtually blocked access to the phuket international airport so passengers cannot get in or out
8877317 at first it was like what are we doing walking in the middle of the street
8877318 laurie chaves 20 a student at george brown college said after strolling across with lunchtime crowds that flooded the intersection with up to 100 people at a time some filming the event with cellphone cameras
8877319 youre looking for an elmer the safety elephant to be scolding you from the side its organized chaos
8877320 it is plausible that when police are no longer here that people will cross when the red hand is flashing but that is a concern at every intersection across the city
8877321 at nighttime if theres no police here its a different corner man homeless people drunks i hate to say it but somebodys going to get hurt i hope it works but i think this is a publicity stunt for the city
8877322 its great fun its been done many other places in the world and it works there so there is no reason it shouldnt work here
8877323 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that
8877324 as far as im concerned the liberal party leadership is a team of dr nelson and julie bishop and im supporting them
8877325 i intend to keep on serving the people of higgins
8877326 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8877327 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8877328 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament
8877329 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
8877330 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them
8877331 its very nice of tony to say nice things about me and i appreciate it very much hes an old friend of mine and i thank him
8877332 to be part of his 300th game on the weekend will be awesome
8877333 i just hope we can reward him with a win
8877334 it would have been ideal for me to finish with the club playing good football but i guess thats football isnt it
8877335 both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007
8877336 eu estou segura de que ele vai chegar at o fim
8877337 eu estou segura de que ele vai chegar at o fim agora que hillary clinton se posicionou de maneira firme e declarou apoio candidatura dele

8877349 once again we continue to realize our goals in providing every platform equal and quality gis processing and viewing tools
8877350 the mac platform is a much valued platform for our solutions and were proud to have full functionality available across platforms were very pleased the orbit gis can be offered with an integrated mac osx look and feel orbit gis 4 x users can upgrade at no cost orbit gis 4 3 is flexible and not intimidating to use now gis work is no longer rocket science
8877351 we believe that a high resolution online imagery service like nationwide prime which is updated quarterly with the latest commercial and publicly available data will give arcgis users an invaluable base for a wide variety of gis projects and applications
8877352 by helping to provide arcgis users with consistently updated high quality commercial imagery of the united states i cubed has been an important partner in delivering premier imagery for projects requiring such basemaps
8877353 our customers face common challenges when dealing with managing assets sharing information between departments and making information available outside their organizations among other things
8877354 this informative and collaborative seminar will show how arcgis 9 3 addresses these challenges throughout the product suite the event is also a great opportunity for our users to interact with esri staff and to share their experiences with others in the arcgis community
8877355 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week
8877356 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8877357 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8877358 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8877359 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8877360 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
8877361 that first game that right there ill never forget that
8877362 even though we didnt make it to the super bowl that year that was my super bowl i never seen anything like that and i was just happy to see people out in the streets just happy to see the saints play that day thats probably one thing ill always remember about new orleans is that day
8877363 long road ahead but i think its definitely a good start
8877364 we pray that for all of us this is a point from which we can move forward and truly begin to heal
8877365 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8877366 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8877367 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8877368 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
8877369 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
8877370 we need to recognise there are racist feelings among some members of our community and they are unacceptable the good news is that the whole political establishment says no to extreme racist thoughts in this town

8877391 why me why was i saved i should have been the 271st victim and i still feel terrible for all the other people who died
8877392 i keep thinking why did god have mercy on me i hadnt even been very religious up until that point in my life god gave me a second chance
8877393 that day i was given the gift of life all over again it was as if a voice in my head said now do something good with your life it is my duty to repay that gift by helping others in any way i can and this is what i try to do
8877394 they asked me if i wanted it back but what would i do with that i have my life and my family what more do i need
8877395 jai dit tr s clairement au s nateur mccain que j tais tr s honor quon me demande de parler la convention et que je serais honor de faire tout mon possible pour laider gagner la pr sidence mais que l tat de californie et le budget taient les choses les plus importantes

8877403 you have to cross the bridge behind the register and just help yourself
8877404 theyre kind of hidden theyre next to the wall beside the refrigerator just help yourself
8877405 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8877406 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8877407 until we gain access to the house and complete our search and examination we are not in a position to make any further comment on such issues
8877408 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8877409 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8877410 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8877411 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
8877412 and they were talking just about money money money money money
8877413 i dont think that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation im sure that that poor guy is not sophisticated and clever and capable enough to carry out that job

8877586 the way to fix negative images of israel is to present israel in a positive light elsewhere
8877587 never has there been this scale of combination of business and philanthropy for israel
8877588 has placed more than 5 000 stories with positive images of israel and israelis in mainstream american media
8877589 tens of millions of eyes see israel21c reported stories yet most of them dont know that israel21c is the source
8877590 all the recent research on israels image or brand in america indicates that the one demographic group that has the least positive knowledge of israel in america is men under 30 to them israel is a place of armed military conflict and little else

8877601 ulster bank is disappointed by the decision of the equality authority and would like to confirm that there was no upper age limit in 2005 in relation to applications for a personal loan this remains the case
8877602 theres no difference between a 20 year old and a 60 year old its all based on their capacity to pay
8877603 i feel now that ive struck a blow for older people
8877604 i told her brightly and not a bit ashamed that i was 70
8877605 i rang up to cancel the car i was too embarrassed to call round
8877606 i dont want to sound like a female victor meldrew but older women are being dismissed all the time
8877607 i knew i could well afford to pay it but they were very overbearing i just didnt lose my cool
8877608 it draws attention to the ageism experienced by older people in our society and in particular to the manner in which age limits are used to exclude older people
8877609 older people with good credit records and evidence of their ability to repay a loan are frequently refused by financial institutions the inability to access credit can have a major impact on a persons ability to live a fulfiling life
8877610 todays ruling means another obstacle has been removed for older people we hope that all financial institutions will review their policies towards older people as a result
8877611 arbitrary refusals of loans because someone has reached 65 are unacceptable

8877624 that being the case he is our player for the next two seasons so you can draw your own conclusions from that
8877625 in a healthy environment and in a team with a winning spirit there is no problem that cannot be sorted
8877626 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8877627 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8877628 he will have to get used to it because it is different to spain but he showed he is a world class player both at madrid and for brazil and world class players adapt
8877629 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished
8877630 like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term

8877640 in spite of the economic decline many consumers continue to be driven by factors beyond price which has created a barbelling trend
8877641 this means consumers are gravitating toward one extreme or the other whether its a healthy lifestyle convenience price or something else
8877642 these costs will eventually have to be passed on to retailers and this may continue to drive food inflation into 2009 and beyond even if commodity prices have stabilized
8877643 some traditional strategies may not be as effective as they once were while others are likely to gather momentum in light of inflation and the soft economy

8877645 the area where this distressing incident took place is as everybody knows under the control of the resistance hezbollah
8877646 hezbollah must explain and not justify what happened because the death of a brilliant officer cannot be justified whatever the circumstances of the incident

8877657 ifrs represents a new chapter in u s public reporting requirements and with that a fundamental shift in how we view accounting and financial reporting financial executives of companies across all industry sectors will need to fully understand the impact ifrs will have on their organization including the potential costs and benefits
8877658 the impact ifrs will have on companies in each industry sector will vary depending on the issues unique to the sector some companies have significant regulatory and capital market considerations while others may have complex organizational structures that include multiple subsidiaries and joint venture relationships this series is intended to help financial executives understand the key issues affecting their industry so they can make informed decisions on when and how to embark on conversion to ifrs in a more measured way
8877659 no question about it a successful ifrs conversion project will involve not only understanding the technical accounting and financial reporting issues but also issues around internal processes and controls regulatory statutory and management reporting technology infrastructure and organizational issues such as tax treasury and cash management legal and human resources

8877689 you will recall that in your letter dated august 18 2008 with reference rmc fef 64 1 48 you requested our clients to refund the sums of n200 072 505 00 two hundred million seventy two thousand five hundred and five naira and 100 025 388 00 one hundred million twenty five thousand three hundred and eighty eight naira respectively which you said were paid as pension allowances
8877690 contrary to your assertion that the monies are for pension allowances they are indeed for other benefits monetised as provided by the laws of gombe state you will also recall that letter was given wide publicity in print media such as thisday daily trust and punch newspapers
8877691 we have pursued all relevant laws of gombe state and the relevant provisions of the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria 1999 it is our considered legal opinion that our clients acted within the confines of the law
8877692 therefore our clients take serious exception to your letter requesting for the refund of the said monies and your dissemination of the said letter to all the state governors and speakers of the state houses of assembly
8877693 we firmly believe you are aware that many states of the federation have enacted similar laws and serving governors and their deputies have benefited therefrom

8877739 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta

8877763 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in inter ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over

8877765 we have serious grounds to think that there were us citizens right in the combat zone
8877766 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8877767 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of us president
8877768 and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8877769 it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8877802 i am pleased that we have outgrown that way of thinking about delivery of health services

8877833 of the 150 subjects only 75 will take the yoga sessions this will help determine the benefits
8877834 we were medically examined before the sessions started and we will be examined at regular intervals
8877835 i am innocent i have full faith in the judiciary i am here to give my statement
8877836 im thrilled to report record growth in the gaming in indonesia sector
8877837 this signifies that anyone who invested their money more than three years ago saw a 25 return on their money which is fabulous
8877838 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the gaming in indonesia market works and with patience you can walk with big money
8877839 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
8877840 its better to look through the mid range gaming in indonesia companies for ones with strong growth potential
8877841 its a shame that our industry isnt seen as more main stream
8877842 if more main stream investors got involved through good brokerages wed see a higher division of risk across the board this is especially important in our business model because if we rely on one or two large investment firms they can end up constantly twisting our elbows
8877843 weve seen more people getting into investing and more company executives doing more aggressive marketing and sales with the knowledge that they are backed by a diverse number of share holders
8877844 with the internet and vast array of research information available starting up is much easier and significantly less costly this allows us to push profits right away and to establish a solid presence in the gaming in indonesia field quickly
8877845 i always tell my gaming in indonesia clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
8877846 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
8877847 starting up a gaming in indonesia business takes time and significant investment so plan your strategies carefully

8877897 the idea behind the mix was to combine tracks i normally dont play out with a few classics and some new tunes as the mnmlssgs mixes offer a chance to do something different i wanted to have the mix evolve not only from start to finish but also along the way so it is not your usual calm beginning and pounding end but more like a constant oscillation between dancefloor friendly tunes and less known tracks such as dynamo the baby ford one and a made up sound and then theres a snippet from one of my all time favourite experimental electronic albums document 2 released by the australian dorobo label to top it off i included two of my latest tracks it is the first time i send these in to the world no beats only textures

8877903 with the number of homophobic attacks rising in the dutch metropolis amsterdam officials are commissioning a study to determine why moroccan men are targeting the citys gays
8877904 half of the crimes were committed by men of moroccan origin and researchers believe they felt stigmatized by society and responded by attacking people they felt were lower on the social ladder another working theory is that the attackers may be struggling with their own sexual identity

8877949 based on the returnees and newcomers our goal is to be on top of the conference at the end of the season
8877950 we want to be playing well and win the conference championship
8877951 she has an incredible knowledge of the game and is a very smart player she is a leader by her actions on the court
8877952 she sets the tone with her attitude and is very disciplined she challenges the new players to be as good as they can be chrissy has worked really hard in the off season she has developed her hands and made them stronger chrissy was a good setter last season now she is a smart setter she runs the position better and our offense is more effective
8877953 she brings a lot of mobility and is very strong defensively as the libero she will get a lot of time on the court jess is the most improved since last season she had never played volleyball before she joined the team jess is a strong blocker and a reliable passer she is a clutch hitter that will come through with a point samantha is coming back from an injury and rehab she was nervous at first but now is very aggressive samantha has an extra strong swing
8877954 she is in good shape from basketball chelsea has strong mechanics and will make an instant impact she will dominate at the net karen has stepped right back in she is a strong passer and a powerful hitter her return was a good surprise addition to the team she has experience out on the court and will provide some leadership
8877955 rachel was one of 11 seniors that graduated from the first volleyball class at cherokee
8877956 she is an extremely strong passer and is very good on defense in the backcourt rachel will split time with casey at libero in addition she is a strong hitter and will see some time on the front row heather is fundamentally sound and has played all three positions she has the experience of a veteran as a freshman
8877957 sarah is an extremely strong athlete that covers the court well
8877958 she is very accurate with passes and is a quick learner sarah will be the backup setter krista is a strong blocker and server she moves very well for her size
8877959 the competition on saturdays will give us the opportunity to play several players and they will get experience a lot of the teams we face are teams that the schools in north jersey do not play the pennsylvania and maryland schools are stronger teams that will prepare us for the njac tournament

8877967 i dont think you can come into a state like ohio and have any success at all with a complete free trade policy and lack of concern about the downside of globalization
8877968 this is an issue that would play very very well with a demographic he needs to pick up
8877969 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta
8877970 democrats have to tread lightly because bill clinton was in the white house when nafta passed
8877971 the nafta stuff will in fact come back into the campaign dramatically

8877992 if there is a moment in my career where i regret a decision it was clearly the day after the fa cup final when my agent told me club x want you tomorrow and i told him no i love it here and i dont want to go i want to stay
8877993 thats the moment i regret after that day after that final i should have left chelsea and i would have the chance in wembley to say goodbye to the fans and to say goodbye to english football so thats a moment i regret because the next season lasted only a couple of months
8877994 i love that club im in the history of that club and i left the club in the right moment to feel like that and to say that honestly
8877995 there were great expectations and hopes that we would buy heavily this summer
8877996 its not our decision who he wenger spends money on nor will it ever be our decision
8877997 if he said to us i want this guy and hes 30million can i buy him the answer is yes absolutely yes
8877998 we totally back him its his decision if arsene found the right player he would buy that player but at the moment his hasnt
8877999 it was my player and i did not do well enough i made a mistake and i know i have to be close to my player next time
8878000 it is sometimes good to play every three days because you get the chance to put the last game behind you
8878001 we all know how difficult a premier league game is any premier league game so we have to fight for it
8878002 if we think we can just turn up to games and things will be the same as last season then we are very wrong
8878003 to have the same results as we had last season we have to fight in every game
8878004 we know we can do better and we will have to get better if we want to do the same or more than we did last season
8878005 first of all we have to progress from the group stage and to do that you need 10 points to qualify
8878006 the tournament really kicks off in february that is when it gets exciting the one off knock out stages
8878007 i think we have a squad to challenge the best but you cannot think of yourselves as favourites when you see teams like ac milan barcelona and juventus all great names
8878008 we will make sure we apply ourselves in the right way then we will have a chance
8878009 standard liege were a surprise to me because belgian football has not been that great for some years now but it was an excellent performance against
8878010 i am delighted for our fans we have once again drawn the champions of europe last season it was ac milan the year before it was barcelona
8878011 if we are going to play in europe and we are very proud to be scotlands representatives we may as well start with the big ones
8878012 mascherano is training well lucas likewise so both of them will come into contention for the
8878013 we have plenty of options now in the middle but i have no problem considering mascherano for the match after his trip to beijing
8878014 maybe having won a second gold medal he will be inspired to perform well for us
8878015 he has kept in contact with me during the olympics and has been keen to know everything that has been going on at the club now he is back he is a welcomed addition to our playing strength
8878016 you must give credit to dirk kuyt sometimes he makes a mistake and people react but he never lets it worry him
8878017 he goes again he gives everything and he did just that for 120 minutes to make sure we qualified for the group stages
8878018 the key is that he never hides he played on the right on the left and then as a second striker with fernando torres
8878019 what he gives to the team is really important you must judge over a full season sometimes in one game it may not always be perfect
8878020 we are seeing benefits on the same scale as those obtained by hospital programmes with good patient compliance

8878023 the whole thing has been ridiculous and has made me think twice about ever using endsleigh again
8878024 the bike was a 21st birthday present and as such was priceless to me i locked it up properly using a substantial lock but after i filed my claim i was told that because i hadnt removed the saddle and front wheel the company wouldnt pay out even though the whole bike was taken they told me that this was stipulated in the policy which was complete news to me only when i looked at the small print did this point emerge
8878025 endsleigh market themselves to students and the idea that everyone would be forced to take their front wheels and saddles into their lectures is completely unworkable
8878026 endsleigh has updated its policies this year so that customers do not now need to remove the front wheel saddle or any other part of the bicycle in order to be covered from theft we recognised that this was often impractical for policyholders and so have updated our cover in order to make things easier for our customers although ms khanams older policy clearly stated that they should be removed in order for it to be covered we have decided to retrospectively pay her claim in light of the updated policies and as a goodwill gesture to a valued customer

8878028 i think cornell gives us more pace and attacking options at outside centre
8878029 it was a tough call to make between derick chiliboy and bandise but derick is our first choice hooker and since he has recovered from his hamstring injury he is back in the starting xv with bandise on the bench
8878030 chiliboy will definitely stay in our system and he will be involved in our next match but he has identified a few aspects of his game that he would like to work on we all know that he is not yet at his absolute best after his long lay off but he is prepared to put in the hard yards in order to maximize his full potential
8878031 pedrie has played at lock in the past and provides adequate back up for us we know that we are a bit thin at lock but it will be a great test for our depth
8878032 no doubt the bulls will test us in the scrums
8878033 tighthead is a crucial position in the scrums but this is a great opportunity for jc kritzinger to show his ability the bulls do have a very experienced pack and we are expecting a very physical encounter

8878044 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment

8878048 when barack smiles theres just a certain ann look he lights up in a particular way that she did
8878049 i think that there was a certain combination of being very grounded in who she was what she believed in but also a certain recklessness i think she was always searching for something she wasnt comfortable seeing her life confined to a certain box
8878050 if she saw animals being treated cruelly or children in the news or a sad movie or if she felt like she wasnt being understood in a conversation
8878051 she was very capable she went out on the back of a motorcycle and did rigorous fieldwork her research was responsible and penetrating she saw the heart of a problem and she knew whom to hold accountable
8878052 weve created stability for our kids in a way that my mom didnt do for us
8878053 my choosing to put down roots in chicago and marry a woman who is very rooted in one place probably indicates a desire for stability that maybe i was missing
8878054 she was a very intelligent quiet girl interested in her friendships and current events
8878055 she wasnt particularly interested in children or in getting married
8878056 that the depiction of childlike blacks i was now seeing on the screen was what my mother had carried with her to hawaii all those years before a reflection of the simple fantasies that had been forbidden to a white middle class girl from kansas the promise of another life warm sensual exotic different
8878057 everything was oratory from him even the most commonplace observation
8878058 everyone had an opinion about everything and everyone was of the opinion that everyone wanted to hear their opinion no one more so than barack
8878059 she was scarcely out of high school she was mostly kind of an observer
8878060 my mother was that girl with the movie of beautiful black people playing in her head
8878061 i never probed my mother about the details did they decide to get married because she was already pregnant or did he propose to her in the traditional formal way
8878062 i suppose had she not passed away i would have asked more
8878063 he was a man of his time from a very patriarchal society
8878064 walking off the plane the tarmac rippling with heat the sun bright as a furnace
8878065 that got the kids laughing and then they all played together
8878066 my mother whose parents were nonpracticing baptists and methodists was one of the most spiritual souls i ever knew
8878067 but she had a healthy skepticism of religion as an institution and as a consequence so did i
8878068 she was very much of the early dr martin luther king era
8878069 she believed that people were all basically the same under their skin that bigotry of any sort was wrong and that the goal was then to treat everybody as unique individuals
8878070 a pretty black girl with braids an inuit sacagawea a little dutch boy with clogs
8878071 but when i think about the fact that i was separated from her i suspect it had more of an impact than i know
8878072 colonial powers were collapsing countries needed help and development work was beginning to interest anthropologists
8878073 she was no pollyanna there have certainly been moments when she complained to us
8878074 but she was not someone who would take the detritus of those divorces and make judgments about men in general or love or allow herself to grow pessimistic
8878075 she kept a certain part of herself aloof or removed
8878076 i think maybe in some way this was how she managed to cross so many boundaries
8878077 she was influenced by hanging out in the javanese marketplace
8878078 where she would see women with heavy baskets on their backs who got up at 3 in the morning to walk to the market and sell their produce
8878079 she had compared with other foundation colleagues a much more eclectic circle
8878080 she spoke mostly in positive terms what we are trying to do and what we can do
8878081 i inherited that i think from her she was suspicious of cant
8878082 her memory loomed over me is this something that she would trust
8878083 i dont think she was entirely comfortable with the more aggressive or militant approaches to african american politics
8878084 for someone like ann who had a big personality and was a big presence
8878085 indonesia was very accepting it gave her a sense of fitting in
8878086 but she didnt make a big deal out of it
8878087 i would say her work had a lot to do with the success of the program
8878088 all of us knew where barack was going to school all of us knew how brilliant he was
8878089 probably need a camel caravan and an elephant or two to load all our bags on the plane and im sure you dont want to see all those airline agents weeping and rending their garments
8878090 trunks full of batiks that we dont really know what to do with
8878091 and to barack and maya who seldom complained when their mother was in the field
8878092 she just said it was something he had to work out
8878093 theres just a certain ann look he lights up in a particular way that she did
8878094 i havent realized that ive beaten the number one player in the world
8878095 im just really enjoying this moment now i dont know how im going to sleep tonight
8878096 ive seen amelie play before because shes from my region
8878097 shes kind of an idol in france everybody loves her shes the one whose footsteps we want follow in a little bit
8878098 its really hard to compete at this the challenger level
8878099 you have to do everything yourself and sometimes you compete in places which arent very nice the level is tough too because everyone has to go through these tournaments before going on the wta tour
8878100 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8878101 am i going to be able to get into the top 100 one day because its not worth it unless youre able to do that i was thinking about maybe stopping at the end of this year
8878102 ich bin der festen berzeugung dass jeder erwachsene mensch das recht haben sollte seine eigenen entscheidungen zu treffen ob sie nun richtig sind oder falsch
8878103 wir sch tzen es dass hall of fame uns hilft joey f r 2009 bereit zu machen sie kamen im august vor dem michigan rennen mit dieser idee auf uns zu und wir denken dass dies f r alle eine win win situation ist
8878104 ich bin sicher dass es eine menge gibt was ich noch lernen muss rennsport besteht aus vielen kleinen bausteinen die man alle kennen muss jedes mal wenn ich auf der rennstrecke unterwegs bin lerne ich neue sachen solange ich immer etwas mitnehmen kann wenn ich auf der rennstrecke bin ist es gro artig
8878105 das ist nicht nur f r lippo village aufregend sondern f r ganz indonesien
8878106 lippo wollte eine internationale topveranstaltung wie die a1gp serie nach indonesien bringen und wir arbeiten eng mit dem motorsportverband dem jugend und sportministerium und dem rechteinhaber carbon worldwide zusammen damit diese veranstaltung in den n chsten jahren das highlight des a1gp kalenders wird
8878107 wir kommen in dieser saison zum dritten mal in ein land in dem viele leidenschaftliche fans ihr nationalteam unterst tzen dieses rennen wird f r die internationale motorsportgemeinschaft von gro em interesse sein da indoniesen zur kleinen auswahl der nationen geh rt die einen stadtkurs anbieten k nnen lippo village wird nun aufgenommen in den kreis derer wie surfers paradise monaco melbourne long beach und auch singapur
8878108 die streckendesigner haben die stadt bereits besichtigt und schlie en gerade den finalen entwurf ab
8878109 spa ist eine phantastische rennstrecke mit einzigartigen kurven und einem ganz besonderen charakter
8878110 die kombination eau rouge in der senke wird zwar heutzutage mit den v8 motoren problemlos mit vollgas gefahren aber sie bleibt trotzdem etwas besonderes die kompression ist k rperlich absolut kein problem aber eben ein spezielles gef hl
8878111 es ist sehr beeindruckend wie die autos dort bergab angerauscht kommen und dann wieder bergauf beschleunigen
8878112 auch f r zuschauer kann ich diesen streckenabschnitt nur empfehlen es ist sehr beeindruckend wie die autos dort bergab angerauscht kommen und dann wieder bergauf beschleunigen spa ist im aktuellen kalender die n chstgelegene grand prix strecke zu meiner heimat m nchengladbach das ist f r mich ein weiterer grund mich auf den gro en preis von belgien zu freuen wo ich wieder ein besseres ergebnis erzielen will
8878113 f r mich ist der gro e preis von belgien einer der besten im kalender
8878114 die rennstrecke ist einzigartig mit sehr schnellen kurven die unterschiedliche linien zulassen die ber hmtesten kurven in spa francorchamps sind sicher eau rouge und die bus stop schikane die vor dem 2007er rennen umgebaut wurde
8878115 der kurs ist sehr lang und knifflig man muss die richtige balance und fahrzeug konfiguration finden um keine rundenzeit zu verlieren ein anderer entscheidender faktor in belgien ist das wetter es kann gleichzeitig auf einem streckenabschnitt regnen auf einem anderen aber trocken sein ich freue mich sehr auf dieses rennen
8878116 spa francorchamps geh rt zu den spezialit ten im formel 1 kalender
8878117 wir freuen uns auf den einzigen kurs im kalender den man noch als naturrennstrecke bezeichnen kann weil ihr verlauf der landschaft folgt betr chtliche steigungen geh ren in den ardennen ebenso dazu wie das schwer kalkulierbare wetter
8878118 spa ist zwar nicht die strecke auf der die h chsten geschwindigkeiten gefahren werden das ist monza aber in spa haben wir die l ngste volllastpassage seit der baulichen ver nderung der ber hmten kurve eau rouge und einf hrung der v8 motoren wird ab der kehre nach start und ziel durch diese senke hindurch und anschlie end bergauf mit vollgas gefahren beim vorjahresrennen haben wir gemessen dass unsere fahrer das gaspedal ber 1 865 meter bzw 24 sekunden lang durchgetreten haben hier sind motorleistung und standfestigkeit besonders gefordert
8878119 in nicks f1 08 wird turnusgem ein neuer bmw p86 8 motor mit einem neuen getriebe arbeiten robert wird mit demselben antrieb wie in valencia fahren in den ersten zwei saisondritteln hatten wir keinen einzigen ausfall wegen eines defektes zu beklagen das hohe niveau in der zuverl ssigkeit wollen wir halten sportlich wollen wir uns weiter steigern und in spa wieder mit beiden autos solide in die punkter nge fahren
8878120 die meisten piloten lieben diesen kurs und das nicht umsonst
8878121 spa ist eine der letzten im kalender verbliebenen naturrennstrecken und geh rt deshalb zu den klassikern die meisten piloten lieben diesen kurs und das nicht umsonst die eau rouge ist eine der spektakul rsten kurven in der formel 1 wenngleich sie nun mit den v8 motoren bei trockener piste mit vollgas gefahren werden kann
8878122 spa erfordert ein mittleres abtriebslevel vergleichbar mit montr al eine hohe aerodynamische effizienz ist sehr wichtig weil man in den schnellen kurven des mittelsektors viel abtrieb ben tigt gleichzeitig aber am ende der langen geraden viel top speed braucht um berholen zu k nnen
8878123 von entscheidender bedeutung wird es sein wie man das reifenpotenzial nutzen kann wir verwenden in spa die zwei h rtesten mischungen was vor allem dann zu einer herausforderung wird wenn die au entemperaturen niedrig sind das wetter ist in spa immer eine gro e unbekannte denn es kann in k rzester zeit umschlagen manchmal auch nur auf einzelnen streckenabschnitten
8878124 the real culprits of ozone depletion have been largely eliminated
8878125 but the remaining fluorocarbons do have a lot of global warming potential
8878126 so its an interesting challenge to find ways to break them
8878127 which contain positively charged ions that can rip negatively charged fluoride ions from c f bonds but the reaction is difficult to sustain for long periods as the acid tends to become exhausted by reacting with other compounds
8878128 i would say that this is a real step change in effectiveness over what was possible before
8878129 this is important chemistry both for the beauty of its chemical logic and for its efficiency
8878130 the selective and efficient removal of fluorine in this way is an unexpected and interesting development which is of immediate significance

8878133 i had been obsessed with him since he was 19 and already a fixture in leicester citys first team
8878134 what maybe we have not done in the past is given people what they want but rather assumed what they want not surprisingly they have dropped out of sport at 16 this scheme is about giving something for everybody
8878135 the right thing to do if you want to build a healthier nation and also a happier one
8878136 ten years ago we were looking at 26 of children doing that level of sport
8878137 the government can say quite justifiably that we have seen quite a transformation but we now have a chance to go further
8878138 between 1979 and 1997 10 000 school playing fields were sold
8878139 stuck in a time warp when it comes to their perceptions of school sport in this country
8878140 school playing fields arent being sold off left right and centre pe is not being abandoned from the timetable and competition is no longer a dirty word in fact there has been a dramatic and unparalleled transformation of school sport that emulates the transformation of elite sport in britain
8878141 todays announcement by sport england is further proof of that and builds on our olympic medal success
8878142 a very useful service for people like us who are away from home all the time
8878143 im going to be the new boy and i aint got a fucking clue how things work there

8878149 there is also a possibility that karadzic will plead not guilty to all 11 counts as well as say that he is proud of what he did
8878150 if he refuses to enter a plea again on this occasion the judge in this case iain bonomy would enter a plea of not guilty in his name

8878165 thanks but no thanks we dont need your pity party all real estate is local
8878166 to three real estate professionals in three unique markets skip smith dished up the salt lake city real estate news in part i of this post and shared that he feels the worst for his market is over part ii continues with a look at columbus ohio
8878167 ive been in the business for only two years and everyone tells me i got in at the wrong time i feel like its pretty decent now
8878168 we still have an overall high inventory of houses on the market but it is decreasing we had a great oversupply of houses at one point but we had a few builders pull out of the area they are waiting until they have a buyer and then they are building out the homes
8878169 the housing boom started in california then moved toward las vegas and into estate like a locust migration it died out after it got up into ogden and we were left sitting with a whole bunch of new construction in which investors handed the keys back over to the banks and walked away from the houses
8878170 so many agents got into the business and are now starving its a buyers market in salt lake city utah but some real estate sellers end up listing with whoever estimates the house value the highest even though in the end it sells for less than originally valued

8878172 people these days are touched by sport you can use this in your trade to build a society that is responsible and loving a society that accepts defeat a society that accepts its own failures because there is always defeat in sport which is a failure
8878173 amid the economic downturn circulation declines and general print media weakness the smart aspiring media mogul heads straight for the internet rather than try to recreate

8878177 they do have a social responsibility and i hope they live up to that
8878178 on behalf of the rcmp i apologize for the actions of supt chambers i hope the results of our investigation assist you in bringing closure to your complaint
8878179 i decided to work towards retirement and kept my head down until i couldnt endure it any more after i got out i decided to complain because of what i went through and because i didnt want others to go through it either
8878180 i had brought this to the attention of my supervisor when it was happening the city took no action
8878181 it ended up being a substantial increase in productivity in terms of us using the software as well as being much better for our officers in terms of not having to look at all those horrible images all the time
8878182 we use another software program and we are satisfied with it
8878183 were always taking a look at what other people have and that sort of thing but are satisfied with what we have right now
8878184 that has to be in place for residents to return
8878185 we have every confidence that the occupancy permit is going to be issued and people will still be able to move in saturday
8878186 the examination of the two transformers and all the debris in the hydro vault room is the crux of the investigation
8878187 people are going to be back saturday in a safe building as safe as any other building in this city
8878188 going to be a lot of kids going to school with high hopes but they are going to be disappointed
8878189 some may have moved on in their lives and it may take time to get new people its not as simple as picking up the phone and saying well see you tuesday
8878190 principals are busy getting their schools up and running and they have to get their staffing issues planned and their hall supervision has to be worked out theyve got a lot of organizing to do to get the school set up for tuesday
8878191 a lot of people come forward with feelings of guilt and shame but my experience generally is its not that common
8878192 it was not committed anywhere in public view and it was committed in an area with little or no public access i dont expect thered be any outside witnesses
8878193 then that stigma walks around with them when they try to access services and people think about them as criminals and dont treat them as well it snowballs
8878194 its a fascinating social commentary about how stigma can stop people from seeking help
8878195 we know that two thirds of the cases were probably not even seeing these are people who either have no symptoms or have mild symptoms and theyre out there spreading the virus and theres absolutely nothing we can do about that
8878196 it probably doesnt make sense to employ legal measures against people who have mumps who are finding it difficult to stay home as weve asked
8878197 you can exclude people from school i would be prepared to consider that for sure in an outbreak situation in which large numbers of people werent being immunized but if they all hang out in a mall its not much help
8878198 were not running low for normal supplies what were trying to figure out is if we need 200 000 extra doses could we get them and how long would it take
8878199 the winners circle will include new construction and price increases along the transit corridor
8878200 the key thing we found from this thing is that if market conditions are favourable and you have supportive land use planning and decisions made by council and planners then you see successful stations
8878201 if you dont have proper planning and market conditions then you see problems
8878202 i dont think anything can make up for the hell weve been through
8878203 i lost 700 000 in revenue my customer count has dropped by about 60 per cent i have mortgaged my house twice
8878204 i would have to work for the next 10 years to get back to where i was three years ago before this started
8878205 a lot of those low level rise buildings will be demolished property values have increased so much that they are not sustained by a low level retail business with a retail shop in it
8878206 the people who are going to benefit are investors in real estate along cambie street and the real estate arm of translink and their private partners
8878207 as long as you cant hear or see that train then youre fine
8878208 i was really big on trying to tweak the performance of my computer so i started sysopt com as a way to reach out to other people to get their help tweaking my computer that was in 1994
8878209 i went out on my balcony and screamed because i was just 20 years old
8878210 we will give you a 350 000 cash bonus if you sign our offer today but if you walk out of the office that is it
8878211 it was an amazing experience for a 20 year old with no business training my hobby paid well
8878212 i look at some of these sites that have received 10 million in funding and i wonder what they are doing with all of that money i dont need it i do it slower for me being an entrepreneur is so much trial and error that i would rather make the mistakes in the lower dollar range than at the super bowl advertising level

8878249 the success of bindra has encouraged us to broadbase our olympic ratna programme to include more players and more disciplines next year
8878250 currently hes the super hero at par with big cricketers like dhoni and sachin if he is able to renew the popularity of the sport over the next few months he will be alive in the consciousness for a long time
8878251 bindras unprecedented achievement fits in with the visibility and advertising required by top marketers he has become an icon and a symbol of achievement youth and leadership for peripheral to mainstream brands another factor which may work in his favour is the cricket fatigue factor which happens from from time to time

8878256 however if you have error checking and correcting ecc ram windows memory diagnostic may not report any errors because the ecc mechanism automatically detects and corrects the error it might still be useful to run windows memory diagnostic if you have ecc ram because it may detect errors that the ecc ram is unable to correct which indicates problems with the ram windows memory diagnostic is limited to testing only the first 4 gigabytes gb of ram if you have more than 4 gb of ram the remaining ram after the first 4 gb will not be tested by windows memory diagnostic

8878263 what a great article the points you made were dead on i too dated tall men all my life it wasnt a strict rule i had it just worked out that way and then i met my husband handsome charming funny kind and short hes 54
8878264 your article in yesterdays newspaper was very entertaining john and i had a chuckle when reading the comments by the women who were not interested in men less than six feet tall especially the one who specified she wanted a tall man to father her children ha ha my husband john is 5ft 8
8878265 id immediately say stand up and would stand in front of them and say im 52
8878266 theyd be shocked shocked i tell you and say well ok thats fine wed usually end up with something like 51
8878267 talkin bout my generation getting new hampshires multi generational work force to work for you
8878268 upon our first meeting with the abbitt family we quickly realized that they wanted an exquisite wedding but with a very intimate atmosphere jessica and jasons vision was to have their wedding in her parents backyard and because it is located directly off the james river a romantic ambiance would be easy to achieve with such a beautiful natural surrounding we focused on lush linens to complete the look every detail was carefully thought out from the fan programs which came in handy on a hot june day the fifteen foot market umbrellas to provide shade to the bamboo chairs that went perfectly with our outdoor setting there were so many special moments throughout the day that it is hard to narrow down just one however i have to say it was a lasting memory for me to see the guests faces when they saw the backyard transformed after the ceremony since both the ceremony and reception were held at the same location it was important to us that we made the best use of the space during the ceremony all of the decor for the reception was hidden behind muslin curtains that we designed and custom made for the deck after the ceremony guests enjoyed cocktails under a tent in the front yard when it was time for the reception to begin all of the curtains were pulled back to show the beautiful tablescapes and special lighting everyone raved about the transformation
8878269 this is not the time to play politics on the issue i know this is the year of elections therefore people are out to make comments for political reasons
8878270 we recommend dialogue between india and pakistan to promote the peace process in the region but because of the kashmir issue these dialogues have been put on ice for the peace process to take place at the peoples level both countries must allow the citizens of the other country to visit freely for which we recommend that visa requirements be lifted if not then the visa process must be easy so that people are encouraged to visit each other
8878271 the pipfpd has planned the same convention in lahore in november 2007 but it was postponed as former president pervez musharraf imposed an emergency in the country and again in may 2008 in peshawar but the current pakistani government informed us that the inter services intelligence isi had not issued clearances so these visas were not issued to the indian delegates we have now set it for november and demand that the pakistan government to issue visas to the indian delegates
8878272 the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure
8878273 the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8878274 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8878275 new chemicals forcing channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader
8878276 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumour treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8878277 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumours
8878278 it gives us the ability to identify treatment failure early and more time to alter a patients treatment plan before the disease progresses
8878279 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
8878280 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
8878281 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
8878282 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
8878283 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8878284 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8878285 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8878286 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8878287 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8878288 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
8878289 this study provides further evidence for darwins theory of natural selection by showing that environmental conditions can directly impact genes controlling physical traits that affect the survival of species
8878290 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8878291 the poor economic and educational status of these women and their overall immaturity caused by a lack of learning opportunities may have resulted in difficulties in preventing illness in their children
8878292 our rapid pace of growth is putting immense work pressure on current institutional structures current ways of functioning and current ways of managing information and current regulatory practices this coupled with heightened expectations of the stakeholders on account of the success of mca21 has created an urgent need to evolve further to meet the pressure and expectations
8878293 the work could be felt as a provocation on the part of the population of alto adige 99 per cent of whom are catholic
8878294 injured the feelings of many people who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god and of our salvation which deserves recognition and religious devotion
8878295 the work not only wounds the religious feelings of many who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god but also offends the good sense and feelings of those who do not identify with the symbol
8878296 the controversy has been exploited by politicians including mr pahl for electoral reasons its true the pressure was heavy but we are an autonomous museum and we have taken our decision the work aroused a lot of argument among visitors many liked it and many disliked it but the public row was merely political and it has gone on long enough

8878298 with his speech tonight obama succeeded in wrapping all those goals up in a neat and effective package

8878301 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market

8878306 we know the name of the mother of the baby john edwards did or did not sire but we are in the dark as to who may have authored the scheme that cost thousands of people their jobs and their savings and that gave the financial markets a major kick down the mountain a fall that will continue to take millions of us with them
8878307 all you have to do is take out a few six months same as cash loans and then pay them off it worked for us

8878309 obama stunned the audience with a buss to jill biden

8878312 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved the afp said in a statement
8878313 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8878314 delighted at the news but wanted an apology from the government and as yet unspecified damages
8878315 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation mr hodgson said
8878316 a matter for further down the track after a federal government inquiry into the case
8878317 he still loves australia but no decision has been made about whether hell come back to australia and if so when
8878318 it is hard to know with the afp they dont deal with things with a straight bat he told the abc
8878319 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
8878320 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused he said
8878321 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position mr hodgson said
8878322 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated
8878323 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done greens leader bob brown said
8878324 but you couldnt blame him if he didnt want to risk it a second time
8878325 the last government owes both him and his country an apology it should come from john howard senator brown said
8878326 is no longer a person of interest amp squo amp squo

8878329 weekend tv preview which is an invaluable resource for alerting you to j league stuff that you will never get round to seeing but might do if there was absolutely nothing else going on or nobody else around
8878330 i knew coming back that this was going to be my biggest season yet
8878331 people cant keep relying on me being young any more
8878332 im 21 now and its time for me to step up to the plate and start being a man by taking hold of games and driving the team on hopefully i can get more games under my belt and keep progressing
8878333 that was a great start and it seems like yesterday its all happened very quickly but its been enjoyable and i think ive matured more as a person players like alan mahon ade akinbiyi and david unsworth have been very helpful in bringing me on and im thankful to them and many others
8878334 now its all about setting new goals and pushing on id really like to add more goals to my game last season i got five and had chances to score a hell of a lot more each time i just want to beat last seasons total and its important for us to chip in because we cant keep relying on martin paterson and the strikers

8878344 weve got our first tv production coming out on the travel channel in november which were pretty excited about and were looking to develop a lot more television programming
8878345 we did a package of stories two time two years in a row called unsolved mysteries which was just exploring mysterious things that had happened in the wild the pilot is actually hosted by a former intern here who wrote the package tim sohn he and a producer flew to new guinea to investigate the disappearance in 1961 of michael rockefeller the son of nelson rockefeller governor of new york they just came back and rockefeller disappeared while swimming from his boat which capsized to the island that was the last he was seen so one of the first things tim had to do was recreate the swim which had him swimming in shark infested waters it was pretty hilarious he says the scariest thing for him was getting in front of the camera for the first time not the sharks
8878346 hes just so talented hes been at this so long its about time he hit the big time
8878347 its awesome having a song at no 1 for two weeks after working at this for all these years now
8878348 i had a feeling that i might have a hit but i had no idea that it would resonate like it has
8878349 i would like to make a name on my own
8878350 im getting there im living a dream right now i have a charmed life im just thrilled that people are interested in my songs
8878351 i dont think there is a lot of songs written that way outside of country
8878352 ill write about grandpa and the way life is thats what i learned about this style of music when i was growing up im keeping that style alive
8878353 if it werent for those guys i dont think i would be into country
8878354 i remember hearing gospel country in north dakota and that didnt appeal to me but when i heard hank for the first time well it was appealing to a 12 year old kid

8878359 phil hill raced and won many competitions both with prototype cars like the 24 hours of le mans and the 12 hours of sebring won three times each as well as with f1 single seaters
8878360 with our car phil won the formula 1 championship title in 1961 as the first american born to reach this result

8878458 hopefully getting past these barriers mentally and numbers wise we can put that in the past and become the organization were envisioned on becoming
8878459 i think you have to give those guys some credit over there
8878460 theyve got a pretty good pitching staff that will shut you down
8878461 we are devastated this just doesnt happen to your own family its like something you see on tv
8878462 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are now in the process of removing vehicles from the site we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire
8878463 the horses found dead at the scene have been examined and post mortems on them were completed yesterday we are still awaiting the results of those examinations the bodies of three dogs were also found close to the horses
8878464 kirstie is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well
8878465 once it has been deemed safe specialist search teams and forensic experts will go in it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through
8878466 gold leafing vehicles isnt a new luxury the egyptians mastered the technique more than 3000 years ago and tutankhamuns chariot was decorated with gold leaves we are simply continuing this ancient and opulent tradition

8878470 ich verurteile entschieden jeden angriff auf das menschliche leben dessen heiligkeit den respekt aller verlangt und ich dr cke meine spirituelle n he und solidarit t mit den glaubensbr dern und schwestern aus die auf eine so harte probe gestellt werden ich appelliere an die religionsf hrer und die zivilen autorit ten zusammenzuarbeiten im bem hen ein friedliches und harmonisches zusammenleben wiederherzustellen das schon immer ein besonderes kennzeichen der indischen gesellschaft war
8878471 ruft alle dazu auf jeder art von bergriffen ein ende zu setzen
8878472 bei einigen steht auch eine ideologie im hintergrund die nazistisch und totalit r ist das ziel dieser gruppierungen ist es einen fundamentalistischen staat zu erzwingen in einigen staaten indiens haben sie daf r einen fruchtbaren boden gefunden in anderen wieder gelingt es ihnen nicht die bev lkerung f r sich zu gewinnen
8878473 die religion wird missbraucht als ein mittel zur manipulation in diesem fall wird das christentum als eine fremdreligion dargestellt gegen die man k mpfen m sse sie verdrehen die tatsachen indem sie behaupten christen w rden zwangsbekehrungen durchf hren was jedoch gesetzlich verboten ist es gibt viele absurde anschuldigungen
8878474 das irritiert die fundamentalisten oft sie denken dass wir viel st rker sind als es in wirklichkeit der fall ist
8878475 die polizei konnte einige priester und ordensfrauen sch tzen in anderen f llen sagten sie dass ihre kr fte nicht ausreichten sie seien wehrlos
8878476 wir sind davon berzeugt dass wie schon nach den bergriffen nach weihnachten die vertreter anderer religionen die ersten sein werden die uns die hand reichen werden au erdem m chte ich unterstreichen dass die kirche in indien wie die bisch fe sagen trotz dieser furchtbaren gewalttaten daran festh lt zum wohl der menschen zu arbeiten vor allem f r das der rmsten wenn diese gruppen glauben uns durch angst von unserer mission abbringen zu wollen dann haben sie sich get uscht die kirche wird ihre mission der liebe weiterf hren und die liebe gottes allen zeigen besonders den schwachen

8878480 if we will follow the moa by the way it is worded we are practically giving the milf the moon and the stars
8878481 if this will not be implemented the milf and the international state may feel deceived because there is no assurance that congress will go along with what the executive wants
8878482 petitioners believed that there is a potential injury if this document will be signed there is a potential injury here
8878483 thus the word potential what do you understand by the word potential on that account mootness cannot be invoked
8878484 do you believe that this court cannot issue advisory positions
8878485 to rule upon acts of the government despite its political in nature if there is grave abuse of discretion
8878486 applied to this case it may be that we want to avoid repetition of violation of the constitution
8878487 does this mean that the moa will be set aside
8878488 because it will not be signed means it will be set aside
8878489 so youre saying that there is nothing formal that will indicate that the government will not sign the document
8878490 are you aware that under international law declaration of consensus points is already binding
8878491 under international law it does not matter if an agreement violates our internal rules we must comply with our international obligations
8878492 a case can be brought by malaysia to the icj they can compel us to amend our constitution
8878493 you can see the danger that could have happened if that document moa ad was signed
8878494 they have to inquire as to the nature of the document we never acceded to make this an international document
8878495 a domestic document subject to internal laws of the state
8878496 if the intention of this document is to make this a political agreement then this is not subject to the jurisdiction of the icj
8878497 we are delighted to have holbert join the senior management team at visionchina media

8878499 it is with deep regret that we have accepted dennis mumbles resignation dennis is a bright intelligent football administrator with whom i have personally worked since 1990 he submitted his letter of resignation citing personal reasons and we will respect his wishes
8878500 he has made a tremendous contribution to the organising committee and we continue to have the highest regard for his ability
8878501 we wish him well in his future endeavors and hope that he may still be an asset to the 2010 fifa world cup organising committee in future
8878502 we have committed ourselves to increasing the number of trained chws by 1 000 every year and have delivered on this commitment
8878503 as the department of health one of our tasks is to accelerate improvement of quality of primary health care services at community level through training and skills development of the communities
8878504 i am pleased that we have outgrown that way of thinking about delivery of health services
8878505 communities are active participants in the struggle to improve their health status therefore government took a conscious decision to bring on board those unemployed members of the community who had never received formal clinical training
8878506 home based care promotes healthy lifestyle we know our responsibility when visiting patients at their homes
8878507 its not only bathing and giving patients treatment but looking at the broad picture of the patient and family who lives with them

8878512 regardless of which party is responsible for the current situation no one country must endanger the security of another country
8878513 the market is being driven more by external factors the drop in oil prices and the us economic numbers that were released overnight
8878514 when you come in from the airport and drive around the philippines you see basketball courts everywhere with people competing every time i am here and turn on the tv there is basketball on the television people love nba in the philippines and we are delivering a fantastic nba product
8878515 and the fastest area of growth will be in asia including key markets like the philippines
8878516 the merlins at the doj department of justice in collusion with the hoodlums in uniform tried vainly to legitimize classic illegal acts by charging us with a nonbailable rebellion charge
8878517 given the successive legal defeats of the governments legal merlins in political cases such as rebellion it is not far fetched that the arroyo regime will ultimately revive anti subversion law or an internal security act in order to crackdown on legitimate dissent and criticisms
8878518 we dont have to file a case because the chr commission on human rights ruled there were human rights violations in this case the records are already available its up to them to hold their personnel responsible

8878524 when i first heard about the passing on of mr masilela i refused to believe it
8878525 he was a man who would always express his views even the unpopular ones
8878526 in the struggle we were a member of one family
8878527 he always gave inspiration and encouragement to those working with him
8878528 he gave his experience gained while in exile to the department
8878529 we have lost a great soldier and a leader he said
8878530 im going to be the new boy and i aint got a fucking clue how things work there
8878531 i just spoke to el guaje and he said he might be coming too

8878542 seems the press have taken a sound bite of mine out of context

8878558 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved the afp said in a statement
8878559 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8878560 delighted at the news but wanted an apology from the government and as yet unspecified damages
8878561 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation mr hodgson said
8878562 a matter for further down the track after a federal government inquiry into the case
8878563 he still loves australia but no decision has been made about whether hell come back to australia and if so when
8878564 it is hard to know with the afp they dont deal with things with a straight bat he told the abc
8878565 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
8878566 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused he said
8878567 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position mr hodgson said
8878568 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated
8878569 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done greens leader bob brown said
8878570 but you couldnt blame him if he didnt want to risk it a second time
8878571 the last government owes both him and his country an apology it should come from john howard senator brown said
8878572 is no longer a person of interest amp squo amp squo
8878573 the area where this distressing incident took place is as everybody knows under the control of the resistance hezbollah
8878574 hezbollah must explain and not justify what happened because the death of a brilliant officer cannot be justified whatever the circumstances of the incident

8878577 mannen met status en macht hebben een sterker gen en dat is goed voor het nageslacht zegt wentink maar er zit wel een leuke passage in het programma waarin uitgelegd wordt waarom vrouwen bijvoorbeeld ook voor een kunstenaar vallen
8878578 een wetenschapper vergelijkt in de uitzending een kunstenaar met een pauw de pauwenstaart is niet levensnoodzakelijk en een heel onhandig ding maar het is wel een lokmiddel om de vrouwtjes te laten zien hoe sterk hun genenpakket is het kunstenaarschap werkt kennelijk ook als het tentoonspreiden van je genenpakket en dat triggert dezelfde hersendelen als een grote penis een brede kaaklijn en testosteron blijkt uit onderzoek
8878579 absoluut geen slechte betrekkingen met de regering in moskou wil

8878582 in order to be a good actor you have to find a place where you are free but its very unusual to be absolutely free in the way that he was in this movie
8878583 michelle kissed spike with a closed mouth on the corner of his lips there was definitely a bit of caressing going on she was clutching his arm the body language was very romantic

8878586 heath loved the experience of creating this character and working on the film we are so proud of our boy
8878587 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million on them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
8878588 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process
8878589 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8878590 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8878591 our goal is to extend survival and improve the quality of life for cancer patients
8878592 as recently reported data from a phase ii trial for end stage colorectal cancer patients showed davanat extended median survival to 7 months with significantly reduced levels of side effects additionally the data showed no apparent change from the baseline measurements in clinical blood test parameters including platelets and white blood cell counts reduced toxicity data indicates improved quality of life
8878593 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8878594 lifes most urgent question is what are you doing for others
8878595 when you get to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on
8878596 a pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties
8878597 he is one of the best strikers around but the way he doesnt pull his weight for the team is not good for the team
8878598 he is a big sulker he goes in silent sulks he is quite a loner in that way
8878599 it is not easy to communicate with him and that is a shame because he is a very good player
8878600 so wherever he goes the manager will have a tough job with him
8878601 mobile working can liberate people by giving them more flexibility over their time and more control over their jobs both are important in helping to make modern life less stressful as with any technology people can experience problems with mobile devices if they dont take note of simple practical steps such as those developed by bt business before they begin to use their equipment
8878602 mobile and flexible working has transformed both business and personal lives by observing a few general principles workers can ensure they see all the benefits of mobile working without any downside businesses need to be aware of their legal responsibility for the health and safety of employees wherever they are working
8878603 there has been a lack of advice for employees about best practice mobile working despite the explosion in mobile and remote working in the uk this is why we have teamed up with leading ergonomist margaret hanson to produce the advice within
8878604 the number of clinical training positions available for medical students and junior doctors can be increased if governments commit to working with medical education stakeholders to address the shortage
8878605 increasing clinical training capacity will require a significant financial investment which should be tied to the performance benchmarks in the upcoming australian healthcare agreements
8878606 more investment is needed to expand teaching infrastructure develop novel teaching programs such as the prevocational general practice placement program pgppp and adequately remunerate senior doctors who teach their junior colleagues
8878607 in addition we need to expand medical student and junior doctor training opportunities in underutilised settings such as private hospitals general practices and rural areas
8878608 if we can guarantee high quality clinical training positions for medical students and junior doctors then the surge in medical student numbers will pay dividends for underserved australian communities
8878609 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8878610 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8878611 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8878612 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8878613 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families
8878614 we are seeing benefits on the same scale as those obtained by hospital programmes with good patient compliance
8878615 the journal of vascular and interventional radiologys consistent impact factor confirms that it is very well respected by physicians and researchers and is the place for authors to submit important interventional radiology clinical translational and clinical research findings
8878616 jvir delivers significant scholarly peer reviewed scientific and clinical research
8878617 this conference aims to encourage the nhs to recognise the power of music as a crucial form of treatment and health promotion we are delighted to welcome a wealth of experts from across the globe who will provide groundbreaking insights into the enormous value of music and singing on health and well being
8878618 the evidence shows that the contribution of arts and health is grossly underestimated by many healthcare professionals the royal society for public health encourages all organisations involved in healthcare to invest in these evidence based interventions this conference will hopefully raise awareness about the health outcomes possible and in particular the contribution singing makes to health improvement
8878619 the work of the sidney de haan centre could provide some important pointers as to how we can use the arts to improve the quality of life right across our community i am very pleased that my family trust is continuing to support the research that is taking place and i hope that this conference will help to generate much greater awareness of the potential benefits of involvement with the arts
8878620 an active engagement with music can be good for an older persons overall physical and mental health i will particularly focus on the positive effects of singing on the mind and the immune system and how music and art can have positive influences on the course of illness with aging
8878621 i believe singing for health brings huge benefits to certain people last spring the pct held a health and well being event in folkestone a singing workshop engaged participants for a fun filled half hour that made everyone feel great afterwards i have never seen such a gathering of smiling faces the pct is committed to supporting this sidney de haan research programme and i wish the conference every success
8878622 i knew as i closed the final page that this was the film i had been looking to direct
8878623 the story spoke to me on so many levels both personal and artistic
8878624 the women in johns early life truly shaped who he became and the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships are central to this film
8878625 im truly excited at the prospect of sam taylor wood bringing her singular artistic vision to the story
8878626 combined with the genius of john lennon i think thats a very arresting and dynamic combination
8878627 cubase 4 5 is an important update that expands cubase to add even more value for our customers

8878629 software and hardware are melded together with a firewire i o a tactile controller and steinbergs cubase music production system forming an exciting new system that pushes back the boundaries of whats possible in digital audio

8878633 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change
8878634 the strategy i am launching today outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
8878635 whenever people agree with me i feel that i must be wrong
8878636 nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the american public
8878637 if you check your brain at the door youll enjoy it
8878638 the message is clear if you hack into computers you have to realise that the legal consequences could be severe others should take note of mckinnons predicament and ask themselves do i want to end up in his situation id imagine the answer across the board would be a resounding no
8878639 there is also a possibility that karadzic will plead not guilty to all 11 counts as well as say that he is proud of what he did
8878640 if he refuses to enter a plea again on this occasion the judge in this case iain bonomy would enter a plea of not guilty in his name
8878641 we have not yet had a decision as to whether amendments will be made

8878646 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8878647 it is important that people understand both the dangers of obesity and the benefits to their health of losing weight
8878648 even a modest reduction of five to 10 per cent of body weight leads to reduced blood pressure a reduction in the risk of developing diabetes a fall in obesity related cancer deaths and a reduction in total mortality
8878649 we strongly urge anyone who might be at risk to see their gp who can advise them on weight loss options that are tailored to their needs
8878650 we at the pct are very aware of the issue of obesity and it is in our top ten of priorities in the health of the people of county durham
8878651 but it is not just for the nhs it is a multi agency issue about making physical exercise more available and making sure people are able to buy healthy food

8878658 were always concerned for all of our pitchers when theyre less than 100 percent but were pretty optimistic this things getting better
8878659 it just makes sense josh has a great relationship with andrews hes an accomplished doctor get another opinion here hope he comes back and can take the ball pretty soon

8878879 piuttosto che gettare fango sui docenti del mezzogiorno continuando in una incomprensibile azione di demagogia il ministro dellistruzione gelmini pensi ad affrontare i nodi veri e irrisolti del sistema scolastico che nella nostra provincia assumono contorni drammatici con la perdita di numerosi posti di lavoro
8878880 non intendo soffermarmi su quanto gi stato ampiamente ricordato al ministro da voci autorevoli sul livello di preparazione dei nostri docenti argomenta iodice ma il pd casertano non vuole far passare sotto silenzio il dramma di tanti nostri conterranei che si consuma in questi giorni mi riferisco al taglio delle cattedre e alla conseguente diminuzione dei posti disponibili per gli insegnanti precari e per quelli di sostegno il ministro e lattuale governo rileva il segretario provinciale del pd preferiscono evidentemente alimentare pericolose polemiche estive che rispecchiano la loro visione di federalismo teso solo ad allargare il divario nord sud e non avanzare proposte ed individuare percorsi per venire incontro alle legittime aspettative di centinaia di professionisti che a causa di tagli indiscriminati operati nel mondo della scuola sono destinati a rimanere senza lavoro le cifre parlano di 150mila classi tagliate in tutto il paese di numeri che modificheranno di molto la qualit dellofferta formativa
8878881 quanto accade in questi giorni allufficio scolastico provinciale con i nostri insegnanti in fila ad elemosinare quel sacrosanto diritto al lavoro guadagnato negli anni dello studio e dellimpegno dietro le cattedre riprende iodice un segnale che allarma e che rischia di incentivare una nuova fuga di cervelli che impoverirebbe ulteriormente il mezzogiorno se questa lidea di federalismo che il governo di roma intende perseguire il pd di caserta pronto a mobilitare il dissenso dellintero territorio sin dai primi di settembre per gridare un deciso no a misure e provvedimenti che dietro il falso nuovismo intendono far arretrare la scuola pubblica di cinquantanni

8878908 the truth is that max offered her a way out of it all she was offered stability and a move away from the negative press she was receiving in the uk
8878909 she wasnt too sure about new york at first but her father persuaded her and so she signed up at the university and was offered a job

8878919 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8878920 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8878921 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8878922 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8878923 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8878924 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8878925 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8878926 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8878927 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on nov 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8878928 speaking in generally broad terms mr obama offered a contrast between republican and democratic views of the role of government

8878975 pokes fun at the catholic population and offends religion and the pope
8878976 with humor and a tragicomic sense which belongs to art since the times of greek tragedy kippenberger faces his condition of suffering which he expresses in many works also for example in a video in which he crucifies himself
8878977 there is the idea of remembering and never forgetting that this destruction began the day after tisha bav when we mourn the destruction of our holy temples
8878978 its important that they visit here so that they can see and remember what they fed us with as if this thing might bring some sort of salvation or redemption but eventually it slapped back in their faces none of the promises were kept
8878979 every effort must be made to make sure these paintings stay in scotland
8878980 they are very important to the country and the culture
8878981 its a lot of money and fundraising is particularly challenging at the moment you are dealing with the economic circumstances of uncertainty so that many people that might want to support such a thing may simply feel their own wealth is less certain than it might be
8878982 im very concerned for the galleries 50 million is a huge sum of money and in such a short period of time it is quite a terrifying prospect
8878983 the governments should see the wisdom that there is in investing as cultural tourism is an enormous earner
8878984 normally the galleries could rely on big corporate funding but i just cant see it because of the recession it makes fundraising much more difficult
8878985 the big three scottish banks dont have the money for this kind of thing at the moment
8878986 the dunard fund an arts supporting charity would only be able to put forward 1 million or 2 million at best
8878987 the national galleries have been given a significant funding pledge from scottish ministers around which a fundraising campaign can be built
8878988 scottish ministers are aware of the national importance of the bridgewater collection to scotland
8878989 the international position and prestige of our national galleries play a major role in attracting tourists contributing to our economy and promoting scotlands identity abroad
8878990 despite the fundraising there will undoubtedly be a shortfall in the amount of money required
8878991 at that point we will see how much money can be found and no doubt the scottish government will do the same
8878992 that has not happened yet and will not happen for a number of weeks but we accept the tremendous importance of the piece and the dukes generosity in offering it considerably below the market value
8878993 has offended the religious feelings of many people who consider the cross a symbol of gods love and of our redemption pahl quoted the pope as writing in the letter
8878994 pokes fun at the catholic population and offends religion and the pope
8878995 with humour and a tragicomic sense which belongs to art since the times of greek tragedy kippenberger
8878996 i want it to become a museum if that is what the public wants
8878997 but i will only donate the property on the condition that the government agrees to allow me to add a new complex to house a cinema a library and a retail area to show belongings materials and movies about bruce lee
8878998 if it is just an old house it will not attract visitors it needs additional facilities as i plan to show the full story of bruce lee
8878999 if the government chooses not to support the plan i dont think it will be worth donating the property it will be better to redevelop the property into a luxury house to be sold for charitable purposes
8879000 im totally amazed by it the greens im getting are from bowdoinham theyre so fresh theyre so pungent
8879001 we just take simple things and try to perfect it theres always something you can make better
8879002 probably right now its an old book anthony bourdains les halles cookbook its pretty amazing hes pretty straightforward
8879003 thats my favorite place no matter what you get its going to taste the same its consistent
8879004 at the time i got the invitation to enter i happened to have something suitable which i had recently finished otherwise i find its easy to get off track with creating pieces that meet certain specifications
8879005 i really got into the mind of his character and it is so much easier to create when you are someone else you are more free

8879007 the sunshine coast art prize is a goodie because they have all sorts of different kinds of works and they are very open minded
8879008 it shows contemporary art in australia is in really good shape it is very vibrant active and what is so fantastic is that audiences are really interested and people are taking seriously now our artists film makers writers and support comes out in all the art forms
8879009 its like doing a jigsaw to create a dieng information system
8879010 so far dieng has remained a site of mystery with very little scientific data available amid numerous myths circulating in society
8879011 this highland can be a special place for honeymooners dieng only lacks promotion so it is less familiar to people from other regions
8879012 we are now regularly replanting the forest to restore the natural harmony of dieng
8879013 without any alternative it is difficult to halt the expansion of potato plantations because the crop has become a source of living for part of the community
8879014 good teacher what should i do to inherit eternal life
8879015 only god is truly good but to answer your question you know the commandments you must not commit adultery you must not murder you must not steal you must not testify falsely honour your father and mother
8879016 there is still one thing you havent done sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me

8879018 she doesnt know where durham n c is shes never been to those places so the best college she knows anything about is centre and thats where she applies

8879021 go out and get some poor people some poor smart people bring them here
8879022 how do you prove to people that being here will be such an enriching experience that it doesnt matter that theyre in this white rural area
8879023 think about applying for a job at a place youve never heard of
8879024 and then you visit here you fall in love with it and you take the job how unusual is that
8879025 its a serious long term challenge and these high achieving organisations are going to play a central role in securing indigenous peoples participation
8879026 we cannot give any name to russian troops other than occupation
8879027 russia is being ruled by former soviet security service agents who consider the end of the cold war as their defeat
8879028 its outrageous actions it would lead to the disintegration of russia itself
8879029 i think western pressure already put on russia has had its effect
8879030 it works and it will work because russia depends on the west its not the soviet union that was self sufficient
8879031 and so far only the terroristic organization hamas has supported russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia not a single state not even venezuela cuba so far they have not said anything in this regard

8879040 it was apparent at this meeting that the governor did not presume kilpatricks innocence
8879041 to the contrary at this meeting the governor and her staff had prepared a blackboard scenario in which his presumption of innocence was ignored and significantly undercut
8879042 the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad
8879043 jobs in michigan and diversifying our economy and getting barack obama elected as president
8879044 as a result of the governors decision to bow to political pressures and move forward with her hearing we have no choice

8879065 if the pullout indeed happens the losers will be west bengal and its people
8879066 already the state is lagging well behind others in attracting investment the timing of a pull out will be disastrous
8879067 theres a definite urge dont you have it to say the muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order what sort of suffering not letting them travel deportation further down the road curtailing of freedoms strip searching people who look like theyre from the middle east or from pakistan discriminatory stuff until it hurts the whole community and they start getting tough with their children
8879068 it was the advent of the second plane sharking in low over statue of liberty that was the defining moment until then america thought she was witnessing nothing more serious than then the worst aviation disaster in history now she had a sense of the fantastic vehemence ranged against her that second plane looked eagerly alive and galvanized with malice and wholly alien for those thousands in the south tower the second plane meant the end of everything for us its glint was the worldflash of a coming future the message of september 11 ran as follows america it is time you learned how implacably you are hated united airlines 175 was an intercontinental ballistic missile launched in afghanistan and aimed at her innocence that innocence as it was here being claimed was a luxurious and anachronistic delusion
8879069 today in the west there are no good reasons for religious belief unless we think that ignorance reaction and sentimentality are good reasons the time has come for a measure of impatience in our dealings with those who would take an innocent personal pronoun which as just minding its own business and exalt it with a capital letter opposition to religion already occupies the high ground intellectually and morally people of independent mind should now start to claim the spiritual high ground too
8879070 the rejection of reason the rejection of the sequitur of cause and effect of two plus two strikingly in their written works and their table talk hitler and stalin and lenin seldom let the abstract noun reason go by without assigning a scornful adjective to it worthless reason craven reason cowardly reason when those sanguinary yokels the taliban chant their slogan throw reason to the dogs they are making the same kind of faustian gamble crush reason kill reason and anything and everything seems possible the restored caliphate for instance presiding over a planetary empire cleansed of all infidels to transcend reason is of course to transcend the confines of moral law it is to enter the illimitable world of insanity and death
8879071 all religions surprisingly have their terrorists christian jewish hindu even buddhist but we are not hearing from those religions we are hearing from islam
8879072 until recently it was being said that what we are confronted with here is a civil war within islam thats what all this was supposed to be not a clash of civilization or anything like that but a civil war within islam well the civil war appears to be over and islamism won it the loser moderate islam is always deceptively well represented on the level of the op ed page and the public debate elsewhere it is supine and inaudible we are not hearing from moderate islam whereas islamism as a mover and shaper of world events is pretty well all there is
8879073 september 11 was a day of de enlightenment politics stood revealed as a veritable walpurgis night of the irrational and such old old stuff the conflicts we now face or fear involve oppressed geographical arenas but also opposed centuries or even millennia it is landscape of ferocious anachronisms nuclear jihad on the indian subcontinent the medieval agonism of islam the bronze age blunderings of the middle east
8879074 like fundamentalist judaism and medieval christianity islam is totalist that is to say it makes a total claim on the individual indeed there is no individual there is only the

8879077 russia acted calmly wisely and beautifully this was a calm response peace has been established in the region and it will last
8879078 i told them about the real events in south ossetia not the ones told by the western media which indicated a different culprit for the fierce battle
8879079 sco has broadened the possibilities of observer states such as iran from now on they can take part in the organizations activities and we may invite certain countries to the solution of certain important problems
8879080 openness and integration in the region is far better than the cold war in the past imposed by some power when laos was a part of a security belt it resulted in thirty years of war
8879081 laos has been suffering because it is landlocked and isolated connectivity in the region can only bring good things to laos
8879082 in other words imagine that in addition to this year another four years will be under your management work with this in mind act and plan accordingly
8879083 even if ayatollah khamenei would want deep down in his heart ahmadinejad to be the winner of irans future presidential elections he wouldnt express his wish so clearly and publicly
8879084 government officials officials in charge of irans official news agency were probably so happy about khameneis comments that they didnt realize the way they published his comments was not in the interests of the islamic republic
8879085 the remarks by irans supreme leader are a sign of his unconditional support for ahmadinejads government a government that came to power with his special backing
8879086 the problem ahmadinejads government is facing and to a certain degree khamenei is that gradually significant numbers of hard liners have turned into ahmadinejads critics because of his economic policies and his performance on the international scene which has put iran under the shadow of sanctions isolation and even military attack
8879087 the problems that exist in iran cannot be ignored by those living there
8879088 if we interpret ayatollah khameneis comments as a done deal meaning that ahmadinejad will be irans next president whether we like it or not then this is tantamount to the end of the republic system of the establishment
8879089 but i dont think this is the case even if the leader supports such view in the end i think its up to the citizens to decide whether they want ahmadinejad to be president for a second time or not
8879090 its nothing unusual not just one term or two terms ahmadinejad can remain in power for as many terms as khamenei would want him anyhow i hope the people of iran will have a say
8879091 the boards most important responsibility is to protect software freedom and to decide the fsfs goals and tactics that means that they are ultimately responsible for the gnu general public license the lgpl agpl and gnu free documentation license for fsf copyright assigned software and manuals and for much of the infrastructure of running the gnu project as a result board members must first and foremost be committed to the cause of software freedom
8879092 new campaigns new staff and new directions for the organization are ultimately discussed and approved by the board
8879093 richard can be very hands on in relation to a specific target that he needs to be speaking about
8879094 we have a growing membership and we have a view of what we want the membership to be our membership program provides the bulk of our funding but we also want a deeper engagement with out members in the sense that we want them to be activists and we want to be able to provide them with the resources necessary for them to be more effective in this role
8879095 not just out reach out to our members and tell them what were doing but because we get a lot of good ideas from them
8879096 i tend to have close relationships with the campaigns team the licensing expert and the new membership coordinator and have at least weekly conversations with those staff members on particular issues and projects
8879097 we have to work carefully with support from the community and from a very small financial base
8879098 we also have to make sure that we remain coherent with what were doing weve got some chief things wed like to accomplish in the next couple of years but were taking small steps toward them
8879099 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive

8879107 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8879108 we hope to make torchwood a gripping and surprising tv event with storylines that push our team into greater danger and sacrifice joining our main cast are some fantastic guest artists who will only add to making this unmissable tv
8879109 only a physician and surgeon licensed in california is allowed to override treatment decisions
8879110 the next agenda must be forged through starting with the pressures and the struggles that people face in their own lives
8879111 at its most basic this means a clearer story about two things the limits of the market and the new frontiers of the welfare state old labour was hostile to the market new labour has arguably been too deferential to it
8879112 the truth is that the tories change in language has touched a nerve reflecting a big gap in our own political narrative
8879113 yet beneath camerons rhetoric lies the basic philosophy that failed britain in the past
8879114 the tories demand responsibility without offering support they appeal for fraternity without any real belief in equality they have finally noticed society but remain implacably hostile to the state

8879116 in a letter to the bishops of the anglican communion dr williams said that the conference allowed every bishops voice to be heard and helped to rebuild trust
8879117 i believe the conference succeeded in doing this to a very remarkable degree more than most people expected at the end of our time together many people especially some of the newer bishops said that they had been surprised by the amount of convergence they had seen
8879118 and there can be no doubt that practically all who were present sincerely wanted the communion to stay together
8879119 bob strong has decided that it is time for him to leave town 102 we thank him for his outstanding contribution to the radio station since launch in 2006 and we wish him every success in the future
8879120 as a group we are pleased that town 102 has finally released a statement
8879121 we all wish bob all the best on his future and hope that he will continue to work on radio if he is not going to then this will be a very sad day for radio listeners
8879122 people have listened to bobs show across the world via the town 102 website but i hope we can all tune into him again in the near future wherever that may be
8879123 we wish to inform everyone that the protest will not be taking place this sunday although the bob strong fan club will remain on facebook
8879124 ach jenny du magst das ja eh nicht soll ich dir pommes mitbringen

8879126 jenny wei immer wo es pommes gibt und wie teuer die sind ist doch klar
8879127 seit unz hligen monaten beugt eine familie mit tatkr ftiger mithilfe der ngo industrie und unter duldung von sp vp und gr nen das sterreichische gesetz
8879128 es ist sch ndlich dass sp und gr ne dieses m dchen zum spielball ihrer parteipolitischen interessen machen anstatt an das wohl der familie im kosovo zu denken auch die juristen von sp und gr nen haben von anfang an gewusst dass der verfassungsgerichthof die beschwerde der familie zogaj ablehnen wird und ihr von anfang an keinen reinen wein eingeschenkt
8879129 versuche der sp jetzt wieder familienangeh rige nach sterreich zu holen anstatt die familienzusammenf hrung im kosovo zu veranlassen zeigt was sterreich bei einer faymann sp zu erwarten hat
8879130 faymann steht f r die wiener ausl nderghettos f r die ffnung der gemeindebauten f r ausl nder und f r ein generelles bleiberecht das bz fordert einen zuwanderungsstopp und ein noch h rteres asylrecht
8879131 wien ist das einzige bundesland das sozialhilfebezieherinnen ganzj hrig mit 42 euro monatlicher heizbeihilfe unterst tzt zus tzlich gibt es jedes jahr den heizkostenzuschuss
8879132 zw lf mal 42 euro heizbeihilfe plus 100 euro heizkostenzuschuss im letzten winter das ergibt 604 euro in wien vorarlberg dagegen wird von der vp schon f r magere 250 euro im jahr gelobt
8879133 laut vorarlberger landespressestelle ots 017 vom 10 m rz 2008 haben im vergangenen winter insgesamt 5 472 personen bzw haushalte in vorarlberg einen heizkostenzuschuss erhalten
8879134 offensichtlich ist da der vp kollegin ein schwerer rechenfehler unterlaufen denn in wien haben in der vergangenen beantragungsperiode alle 49 000 wienerinnen die unterst tzung beim heizen brauchen den wiener heizkostenzuschuss erhalten der berwiegende teil davon ber 33 000 haushalte hat den heizkostenzuschuss von 100 euro unb rokratisch und automatisch zus tzlich zur heizbeihilfe von 42 euro monatlich erhalten
8879135 und im gegensatz zu den vp regierten bundesl ndern werden die wiener b rgerinnen auch nicht zu

8879137 theres no way in hell that hume or anyone else is going to get the best of me
8879138 die neue regierung soll wissen dass es eine mehrheit in sterreich gibt die hier eine menschenrechtskonforme l sung will
8879139 im gegensatz zu den meisten wahlkampfversprechen steht diesmal ja sogar zu bef rchten dass die von den regierungsparteien propagierten ma nahmen tats chlich umgesetzt werden
8879140 die geforderten ma nahmen sind sauteuer aber sie wirken kaum so hohe kosten bei so wenig nutzen sind einfach nicht vertretbar
8879141 dieses geld kann ja nicht von irgendwoher genommen werden sondern diese mittel werden dann bei der steuerreform 2010 fehlen wenn man statt des ohnehin bescheidenen volumens von 2 7 milliarden dann nur mehr rund 1 5 milliarden zusammenbringt dann sollte man lieber von steuerkosmetik statt von steuerreform reden
8879142 es war bis jetzt konsens von politik wirtschaftsforschern und den interessensvertretungen dass die n chste steuerreform drei ziele erf llen muss soziale treffsicherheit entlastung des mittelstands und st rkung des wirtschaftsstandorts nichts davon w rde mit den jetzt geforderten ma nahmen erreicht
8879143 gerade angesichts der sich abschw chenden konjunktur w re eine aufstockung des volumens der steuerreform auf die vom wifo geforderten f nf milliarden euro dringend geboten an den zielen der sozialen treffsicherheit entlastung des mittelstands und st rkung des wirtschaftsstandorts ausgerichtete ma nahmen w rden sich ganz im gegensatz zu wahlkampfzuckerln bezahlt machen und starke wachstums und besch ftigungsimpulse geben
8879144 ich habe den dringenden verdacht dass die sterreicher genau wissen welchem zweck die aktuelle lizitationspolitik dient und warum jetzt diverse steuerschnellsch sse abgefeuert werden und ich bin berzeugt dass vern nftige wirtschaftspolitik letztlich mehr w hlerstimmen bringen w rde als teure wahlgeschenke f r die ohnehin der steuerzahler aufkommen muss
8879145 die teuerung muss ganz schnell bei jenen abgefangen werden die sozial abzurutschen drohen
8879146 pflegegeld familienbeihilfe arbeitslosengeld und notstandshilfe sind seit jahren nicht erh ht worden und erf llen daher ihren zweck auch nicht mehr sie m ssen sofort erh ht und in zukunft auch j hrlich valorisiert werden
8879147 faymann will den einzelhandel mit fast einer milliarde sponsern die vp erz hlt m rchen von der entlastung der pendlerinnen und der erh hung der familienbeihilfe um von ihrer blockadepolitik der letzten zwei jahre abzulenken
8879148 wenn dieser wahlkampf mit seinen scheindebatten so weiterl uft dann werden die menschen am ende die politik noch mehr satt haben keine hilfe oder entlastung daf r tag f r tag scheindebatten um nichts was wir erleben ist ein sp vp programm zur f rderung antidemokratischer grundstimmung
8879149 angesicht der heute publizierten 26 millionen euro die die stadt wien vom bund f r infrastrukturma nahmen zus tzlich erhalten soll ist es wohl eine berechtigte forderung dass zumindest ein teil dieses geldes f r einen rasche sanierung der u bahn station landstra e eingesetzt wird
8879150 hier zeigt sich deutlich dass ein von der vp wien schon lange gefordertes unabh ngiges qualit tsmanagement bei den wiener linien ein gebot der stunde ist dieses kontrollfreie agieren der wiener linien im konkreten fall zu lasten der schw chsten kann nicht weiter hingenommen werden

8879158 the appearance of nato battleships here in the black sea basin and the decision to deliver humanitarian aid to georgia using nato battleships is something that can hardly be explained

8879166 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8879167 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8879168 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8879169 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8879170 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8879171 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
8879172 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
8879173 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8879174 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8879175 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8879176 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia

8879184 a surdez deve ser reconhecida como apenas mais um aspecto das infinitas possibilidades da diversidade humana pois ser surdo n o melhor ou pior do que ser ouvinte apenas diferente

8879201 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8879202 delighted at the news but wanted an apology from the government and as yet unspecified damages

8879207 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
8879208 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused he said
8879209 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position mr hodgson said
8879210 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated

8879235 the cabinet has given approval for introduction of the plantations labour amendment bill 2008 in parliament for making amendments in the indian plantation labour act 1951
8879236 so we have decided to set up a mechanism to provide for their safety and their health and their wealth of plantation labour
8879237 they the bjp are trying to take the amarnath issue to other parts of the country to create communal disharmony but it is clear that their efforts have failed miserably
8879238 today the agitation is purely political and is being conducted with a vested interest despite the fact that there is no real underlying issue
8879239 the statements and activities of bjp also give an opportunity to antinational elements in the valley to mobilise counter protests giving rise to calls of azadi
8879240 this is the highest ever number of pilgrims in over 20 years during the national democratic alliance nda regime the number of yatris was around 1 53 314 in 2003
8879241 i have told naveen patnaik that bjp should be kept out of the government communal riots will continue as long as bjp remains in power
8879242 my geography teacher meenakshi asked me to participate in the essay competition after becoming the indian climate champion along with dhruv i went to new delhi twice and visited the energy and resources institute teri
8879243 we will set sail from iceland to the tip of greenland before seeing the icebergs melt at iqaluit
8879244 i am interested in exchanging ideas with participants like me from other countries especially those who are doing a lot to mitigate climate change
8879245 among other issues i want to discuss with the scientists and other participants are ways of using the media in creating awareness on climate change
8879246 i met representatives from 16 schools in the city and discussed with them various climate change issues including the need to switch off and minimise use of lights as part of the initiative
8879247 sometimes taxpayers are forced to pick up the tab by funding government spending on pollution control or they may pay indirectly for instance by funding treatment for asthmatic patients through their health insurance premiums
8879248 examples of environmental taxes include carbon taxes where industry is taxed for every unit of carbon dioxide emitted which incentivises firms to find energy efficient and low carbon alternatives congestion charges where motorists pay a fee for entering the congestion zone which encourages them to make fewer journeys in these areas and fuel duties where petrol is taxed to encourage motorists to buy more fuel efficient cars or use their cars less frequently
8879249 in australia the taxpayer is assured that no adjustment to their transfer pricing method will be made if an apa is complied with
8879250 statistical analysis shows that one extra disputed year raises legal compliance cost by 7 per cent the time taken to close an assessment varies from two years to twenty years if the tax dispute goes to the supreme court
8879251 a drug could be tested in india at a rate which is 50 to 60 per cent cheaper than in the us
8879252 the compulsory licensing regime absence of data exclusivity and the accessibility to an effective and organised distribution network are some such issues
8879253 the sequence of events of the case would show that the appellant association coai and its members have been enjoying the benefit of the tdsats observation that it expects parties not to proceed further after the matter has come before it
8879254 therefore the authority has not taken any further steps in furtherance of the showcause notices issued to the service providers in response to the said showcause notices
8879255 because of the fact that even the latest congestion report has now become a part of the pending appeal proceedings the authority has been left with no option but to await the final decision of the tdsat as the pending case has effectively tied the hands of the authority from taking any steps for ensuring quality of service
8879256 he is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8879257 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8879258 finally it seemed there was a topical liquid that produced many of the effects of injections without the pain and huge expense

8879260 ive been working with jimmy page and john paul jones and trying to do some new material and some writing i dont know what it will be but it will be something
8879261 at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material when i get there i never ask any questions if i get a phone call to go and play i enjoy every moment of it whatever it ends up as to get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me
8879262 lots of politics would need to get ironed out if an album was to be recorded but the possibility of doing something is in the cards i really felt it was on the cards from the moment we walked offstage at the o2
8879263 vanuit de bibliotheek regelen we alleen de zaken achter de schermen de rest doen deze kanjers
8879264 de oude bibliotheek elders in de stad moest twee jaar geleden vanwege bezuinigingen dicht na de bouw van prismare bleek dat daar ruimte was voor een nieuwe bieb maar wel kleiner en met minder middelen onze oude locatie was gevestigd naast dagbestedingsaanbieder aveleijn sdt met hen hadden we goede contacten en zo ontstond het idee om cli nten van aveleijn sdt in te zetten in onze jeugdbibliotheek
8879265 we vinden het belangrijk dat onze cli nten een werkplek krijgen dichter bij de maatschappij vroeger was er alleen dagopvang maar dankzij dit soort ge ntegreerde projecten kunnen ze toch volwaardig meedraaien
8879266 ze hebben allemaal scholing gekregen in het sorteren en repareren van boeken het werken met ons computersysteem en ze hebben een cursus sociale vaardigheden gevolgd ze moeten hier toch elke dag met de bezoekers omgaan
8879267 het gaat erg goed we mogen boeken repareren of dingen opzoeken op de computer en we laten de kinderen zien hoe ze de boeken moeten scannen dat kunnen ze namelijk zelf doen op de zelfscanbalie
8879268 de kinderen moeten de boeken op de balie leggen en dan worden ze automatisch gescand wij moeten controleren of ze het goed doen
8879269 ik vind vooral de opas en omas die met kleine kindertjes komen erg leuk
8879270 de kinderen kunnen hier elke dag gewoon naar binnen lopen ze reageren erg positief op onze mensen
8879271 i feel it would be in the interests of pakistan democracy and the pakistan peoples party that this office of president remains above controversy and i would humbly request mr zardari that he should withdraw his candidature in the supreme national interest and in interest of democratic stability
8879272 i do not want to comment on a persons mental health
8879273 but since he zardari is a public figure contesting a public office the office of supreme commander of the armed forces who has his hand on the nuclear trigger who is also chairman of the nuclear command authority it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response
8879274 his masterful handling of pakistani politics since the assassination of his wife and party chairperson benazir bhutto
8879275 distorting the private health records of our nations leader is a remnant of a darker era of our national history
8879276 the people of pakistan would like to know what is the source of this wealth because this wealth has not been declared in mr zardaris tax returns
8879277 deze cijfers zijn vertekend omdat niet alle deelgemeenten gegevens aanleveren bovendien is het in grote steden veel moeilijker dan in kleinere gemeenten om collectanten te vinden en alle adressen langs te gaan ik weet het uit eigen ervaring dat met name het collecteren op hoge flats met lange galerijen een ramp is de mensen daar doen niet snel de deur open
8879278 als kamerlid loopt je mailbox vol met klachten van burgers over het gedrag van herfkens deze kwestie heeft de politiek als geheel veel schade berokkend verhagen maakt er zich nu te gemakkelijk van af
8879279 herfkens doet nu alsof ze een genereus gebaar maakt maar dat is quatsch zij heeft 280 000 euro te veel ontvangen en levert een salaris van 120 000 euro in dan resteert er dus nog een flink bedrag
8879280 herfkens is oud bewindsvrouw van de wereldbank die instantie heeft een heel strikt anticorruptiebeleid het wil er daarom bij mij nog niet in dat zij totaal niet beseft heeft dat zij tegen de regels in handelde
8879281 in veel publicaties wordt gesproken over geweld tussen hindoes en christenen dat is een verkeerde voorstelling van wat er gebeurt onschuldige christenen voornamelijk behorend tot de dalitkaste de voormalige onaanraakbaren worden voortdurend aangevallen door aanhangers van hindoe organisaties die de wet aan hun laars lappen het lijkt erop dat de lokale overheid in het orissadistrict de toestand niet meer onder controle heeft
8879282 in grote delen van orissa hebben hindoe organisaties de wet in eigen hand genomen het gaat daarbij niet alleen om de gewetensvrijheid van de christelijke minderheidsgroepering maar ook om het seculiere karakter van onze democratie die er garant voor staat dat er ruimte is voor alle geloofsovertuigingen de verwoesting van onze grondwettelijke vrijheden moet worden gestopt
8879283 het volgende feest wordt zijn inauguratie in januari volgend jaar fantastisch ik had niet gedacht ooit in mn leven nog een zwarte president te zullen zien
8879284 mccain krijgt zon menigte niet bijeen en dat zegt wel iets over het enthousiasme dat obamas campagne cre ert
8879285 obama wil verandering en hij heeft die belofte vanavond ingevuld met concrete voorstellen de republikeinen kunnen daar alleen maar acht jaar wanbeleid van president bush en vicepresident cheney tegenoverstellen
8879286 zon uitspraak is significant voor het enthousiasme dat obama opwekt en dat scherp afsteekt bij de twijfels over mccain in diens eigen partij dat is een belangrijke factor die bij de verkiezingen begin november de doorslag kan geven
8879287 kennedys toespraak in los angeles was historisch net als dominee martin luther kings
8879288 van mij mag obama dit iedere week doen want ik heb beter verkocht dan tijdens de beste sportweekeinden
8879289 colorado is traditioneel geen typisch democratische staat maar wij hopen dat denver en als het kan heel colorado in november voor obama kiest zulke overwegingen spelen natuurlijk mee als men voor een bepaalde locatie kiest hopelijk werkt het wij zullen er uiteraard alles aan doen om de democratische boodschap die hier de afgelopen dagen op nationaal niveau zo welluidend en overtuigend werd uitgedragen op regionaal en lokaal niveau verder door te geven
8879290 the owners have been interested in preserving a competitive balance
8879291 perhaps the more interesting question is whether indie bloggers and new media folks are now becoming a part of the mainstream at the same time the mainstream is reaching out and using the tactics of the independents
8879292 in terms of making the actual events more engaging theyre probably spending more time worrying about the timing of the balloon drop
8879293 perhaps the more interesting question is whether indie bloggers and new media folks are now becoming a part of the mainstream at the same time the mainstream is reaching out and using the tactics of the independents
8879294 in terms of making the actual events more engaging theyre probably spending more time worrying about the timing of the balloon drop
8879295 what maybe we have not done in the past is given people what they want but rather assumed what they want not surprisingly they have dropped out of sport at 16 this scheme is about giving something for everybody
8879296 the right thing to do if you want to build a healthier nation and also a happier one
8879297 ten years ago we were looking at 26 of children doing that level of sport
8879298 the government can say quite justifiably that we have seen quite a transformation but we now have a chance to go further
8879299 between 1979 and 1997 10 000 school playing fields were sold
8879300 stuck in a time warp when it comes to their perceptions of school sport in this country
8879301 school playing fields arent being sold off left right and centre pe is not being abandoned from the timetable and competition is no longer a dirty word in fact there has been a dramatic and unparalleled transformation of school sport that emulates the transformation of elite sport in britain
8879302 todays announcement by sport england is further proof of that and builds on our olympic medal success
8879303 ini bermakna bilangan penerima bantuan meningkat dua kali ganda daripada 54 000 isi rumah kepada 110 000
8879304 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
8879305 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
8879306 he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
8879307 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equaling spitzs record
8879308 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
8879309 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before
8879310 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that

8879312 vorige maand is er al wel een oproep rondgemaild aan de achterban en er staat er ook een op de website maar de offici le procedure begint morgen dan zal er ook worden geadverteerd
8879313 ik zou de tweede jeugdwerkadviseur worden naast piet versluis maar ik vond het niet zomaar een functie en vroeg me af wat is hierin de wil van de heere
8879314 wilde ik voordat ik ging solliciteren een duidelijk antwoord hebben op die vraag
8879315 heere wilt u de sollicitatieprocedure gebruiken om duidelijkheid te geven
8879316 die week raakte piet versluis vermist in de oostenrijkse bergen hij is nooit teruggevonden ik zou naast piet komen te staan hij zou me gaan inwerken gelukkig was ik in de maanden voordat ik in dienst kwam verschillende keren met hem mee geweest en zodoende had hij mij al een stukje ingewerkt
8879317 ineens stond ik er alleen voor ik was 23 wat moest ik tegen al die ervaren jeugdwerkleiders gaan zeggen maar het bestuur heeft toen veel werk verzet n de vele vrijwilligers niet te vergeten in 2001 is peter van den dool benoemd die nu bij friedensstimme werkt
8879318 maar het afgelopen jaar hebben we intern geconstateerd dat bij een organisatie van deze omvang een kantoor duidelijk voordelen heeft de mogelijkheden daarvoor worden het komende seizoen verder onderzocht en wellicht kan een kantoor worden betrokken waar dat zal zijn is nog niet bekend dat hangt nu uiteraard ook een beetje af van waar mijn opvolger vandaan komt
8879319 ik heb het acht jaar heel goed naar mijn zin gehad werken met jongeren met leidinggevenden in het jeugdwerk is mooi leerzaam ook
8879320 zelf had ik het meest met 16 jongeren te maken die spreek je dan ook het meest op conferenties of zo
8879321 vooropgesteld als lcj hebben we een plek gekregen binnen het behoudende deel van ons kerkverband
8879322 maar wel werk dat past bij mijn interesses en het ide le aspect spreekt me zeker ook aan
8879323 waarschijnlijk hoef ik ook niet meer zo vaak s avonds op pad want ik moet zeggen als ik soms voor de vierde avond in een week van huis was om bijvoorbeeld ergens in het land een lezing te houden over het belang van huisgodsdienst dan hoorde ik mezelf wel eens praten
8879324 we hebben de catechisanten ook gevraagd of zij over het algemeen begrijpen wat ze lezen in de bijbel wat ons erg opviel is dat bijna twee derde van de lager opgeleide jongeren vmbo en mbo aangeeft bijna nooit of nooit te begrijpen wat ze lezen ik vind dat heel verontrustend van de hboers of hoger geeft driekwart tot vier vijfde aan wel te begrijpen wat ze lezen het geeft wel aan dat juist de vmboers de pastorale aandacht van de jeugdwerkleider of catecheet behoeven
8879325 in de meeste gemeenten is het ouderenpastoraat gelukkig goed geregeld en er komt ook steeds meer aandacht voor jeugdpastoraat maar dat is een stuk lastiger toch zijn persoonlijke aandacht voor jongeren een luisterend oor en tijd voor hen heel belangrijk het is jammer wanneer veel jongeren alleen een persoonlijk gesprek met een ambtsdrager hebben als zij daar zelf om vragen
8879326 dit zijn vaak ook de jongeren die op een jeugdvereniging zitten
8879327 het is me wel eens gebeurd op een bijbelstudieconferentie dat je jongeren die het ene moment serieus meedoen met een bijbelstudie het volgende moment in een hoekje achter de laptop een filmpje ziet zitten te kijken film popmuziek gospelmuziek het heeft een ontzaglijk grote aantrekkingskracht op onze jongeren
8879328 ongeveer 35 procent is zeer positief en betrokken ongeveer 40 procent vormt een middengroep waarvan ongeveer 20 procent redelijk positief is en ontvankelijk voor godsdienstige zaken en 20 procent minder positief is en minder toegankelijk voor godsdienstige zaken deze middengroep staat niet onverschillig tegenover de kerk en alles wat daarmee samenhangt maar is ook niet met overtuiging daarbij betrokken ongeveer 25 procent is onverschillig en dreigt af te haken

8879332 as far as our son is concerned the loss is unbearable
8879333 its been a horrific two years dealing with losing our son and then having to push law enforcement to do something about it
8879334 we didnt even hear about the marijuana in nortons backpack until july of this year
8879335 we do a lot of comforting sometimes it takes two or three months until we get into a steady routine
8879336 a lot of the kids miss their parents theyre used to half day kindergarten
8879337 denying others the right to prosperity based on the use of their properties
8879338 who cares why cant he be americas next top model
8879339 i dont see a problem with it equal opportunity for all

8879346 we would rather talk to you now and make you cognizant before there are any problems
8879347 cant be in the business of replacing peoples septic systems
8879348 the tastefully simple opportunity is designed to be life friendly
8879349 consultants find a great deal of satisfaction through its fun nature flexibility unlimited earning potential and top notch products
8879350 there was no running that i saw thank you very much keep it up
8879351 i figured it would benefit a larger community rather than just a single town
8879352 it will be a great addition to the landscaping here
8879353 there are things we need to do concurrently we can still rely on our traditional resources but we need to develop new resources
8879354 its utilities that are killing small businesses they are double what they were a couple years ago
8879355 a lot of people dont understand it kills a lot of small businesses
8879356 i get so upset when i hear politicians on tv saying small businesses are the backbone of our country then why are they crippling us
8879357 we provide full meals monday and friday hot meals the rest is easy to heat people may have to choose
8879358 residents should make sure not to leave anything of value inside their vehicles
8879359 i think its fantastic to have dr richards on board she is very dedicated and has great ideas and experience and were thrilled to have her
8879360 i think its an absolutely wonderful gift for the youth in this town its a great organization as superintendent i believe its critical for me to be able to work with all the towns children in every way i can
8879361 positive values boundaries and expectations empowerment and constructive use of time
8879362 i believe that as educators there are more than 20 of these assets which we have direct influence on and as this district is dedicated to educating the whole child and this strong bond between rcfy and the schools here exists so productively we are all developing the assets of our youth which gives our children a tremendous advantage to succeed in life
8879363 its great it means we can get the town back to where it should be i am grateful for everyone who came out to vote tonight
8879364 this is a technical issue not a debate about how we spend money we are trying to remedy a situation that has put us in a precarious position
8879365 there is a wonderful vital spirit among the people here and an appreciation of one another
8879366 some people might not be too comfortable with public speaking so its a good way to show off for friends and family by reading your own writing
8879367 some people have made jokes about wearing berets and bringing bongos its interesting just to see what type of writing shows up
8879368 we are proud we are brave sitting here by these graves just for oil what price we pay how the wolf cries to this day
8879369 hopefully well not get into a water ban situation again
8879370 it helps us tremendously to keep things going this keeps all of our school programs running every little bit helps
8879371 in 2006 and 2007 i toured with a 17 piece band so i could reproduce the sounds of these days the new album id made
8879372 and it was a lot of fun this year im not out promoting a new album so i wanted to do something really different recently i saw james taylor on his tour it was a kind of one man band show with just him a piano player and all those great songs i really enjoyed watching it and i knew i would enjoy performing in that setting as well so im going to tour basically the same way pared down and informal
8879373 im totally amazed by it the greens im getting are from bowdoinham theyre so fresh theyre so pungent
8879374 we just take simple things and try to perfect it theres always something you can make better
8879375 probably right now its an old book anthony bourdains les halles cookbook its pretty amazing hes pretty straightforward
8879376 thats my favorite place no matter what you get its going to taste the same its consistent
8879377 im here to present an exciting project not only for the city as a whole but the fire department in particular
8879378 when we developed these options we looked hard at feasibility and what was practical
8879379 we also looked at what the community and staff had to say there was an overwhelming response that the town wanted the offices to stay in the downtown area
8879380 hon st ller samma fr ga om och om igen
8879381 this country needs someone with his intelligence honesty and values
8879382 i feel strongly that this country needs to change direction
8879383 im delighted that we will be offering this evening program again this year and especially happy to co sponsor this event with historic new england i think people will enjoy the tours and the candlelit wine and cheese reception at the tavern
8879384 im looking forward to everyone gathering at the gilman garrison and then walking down water street to the folsom tavern along the way well share some stories of early exeter and the gilman families roles in the town what a nice way to spend an early autumn evening
8879385 the gilman garrison is not open on a regular basis so this evening tour is extra special its rare for a group to gather in the evening and experience these historic spaces during the twilight hours the way many before us have done this collaboration with aim is a natural fit for us and im sure our visitors will enjoy learning about the history of exeter through the gilman garrison and the folsom tavern
8879386 it became apparent theres a disconnect with what is envisioned in the towns master plan and what zoning allows
8879387 i think if this had existed we would have had a different outcome
8879388 i dont think we are operating in fear for residential in downtown but operating in a market of realities
8879389 one of the challenges is the shear mass of the buildings
8879390 as a young person who feels like an endangered species on the seacoast i feel fortunate to live in a family friendly neighborhood
8879391 the mills are a resource newmarket can capitalize on i am watching with great interest
8879392 anyone should contact state police or hampton falls police who has had contact with mr currier through most likely internet services
8879393 i saw it when i was sitting down after i was hit
8879394 there were two girls and a guy i was talking to him i said you hit me call the police he said give me your watch i passed out i woke up by the time i got home it was 3 30 a m i called my mom the ambulance and state police showed up
8879395 the conservation commission could have properly availed itself of the provisions of rsa 91 a 3 right to know law and discussed the performance of the young man who was the subject of this portion of the meeting in non public session

8879404 we were really working hard to say to people dont think because we havent heard any pools are positive to become complacent and say we are ok this year
8879405 this takes a task force and an already existing commission and makes it one thats ongoing all the time so the department of health and human services gets together with the department of agriculture department of environmental services and they keep track and pay attention with whats going on with the vectors that carry eee and wnv
8879406 its something you have to be aware of unfortunately all the time and you cant just go outside and pick a few weeds you have to plan if you are going out into your garden or for a walk but its also helpful to know your municipality is doing what they can
8879407 im excited about everything and i want to play on the playground
8879408 im nervous but i have about five of my friends in my class
8879409 im excited a little and a little scared im scared about going to the principals office a lot and its a new teacher

8879411 im looking forward to having the kids here its a great school to come into and its a school that people feel connected to the staff is excited and its a hardworking group of people who are happy to be here
8879412 we get the same butterflies in our belly and dont sleep the night before
8879413 i had a sense of honest to goodness sadness before monday and tuesday then monday and tuesday were really hard days i think its the kids job on monday and tuesday to get parents ready to send them back to school kids are anxious to go back theyre nervous theyre at the end of their ropes and theyre bored
8879414 we were really working hard to say to people dont think because we havent heard any pools are positive to become complacent and say we are ok this year

8879420 it gives them a chance to access the full curriculum
8879421 we were really working hard to say to people dont think because we havent heard any pools are positive to become complacent and say we are ok this year
8879422 this takes a task force and an already existing commission and makes it one thats ongoing all the time so the department of health and human services gets together with the department of agriculture department of environmental services and they keep track and pay attention with whats going on with the vectors that carry eee and wnv
8879423 its something you have to be aware of unfortunately all the time and you cant just go outside and pick a few weeds you have to plan if you are going out into your garden or for a walk but its also helpful to know your municipality is doing what they can
8879424 we had a two day summit with the teachers last week
8879425 i can do a lot to advocate for kids with special needs
8879426 an administrator has to be outside the office to be effective
8879427 we need to close the gap between achievers and children who are not achieving at the level we hoped they would
8879428 learning is for all children we need to find out how to get all our students to be successful
8879429 students should come to school even if money is an issue we will work it out for every student who wants an education
8879430 one third of our school board is new this year
8879431 it takes a lot for people to understand all of the issues with our district
8879432 when we set up gbecs the idea was to give students other avenues for study
8879433 there wouldnt be a gbecs if we didnt provide the space and the teachers
8879434 if the school was shut down the kids would come back to exeter high school
8879435 i think thats the point where there is confusion and things need to be clarified
8879436 i think people are confused and i am one of them
8879437 what is in the budget this school year is that all of the teachers and space are being paid for by the cooperative district
8879438 i dont know what my favorite part is because i havent been here
8879439 im really looking forward to all the stuff were going to do this year
8879440 its ironic that we are preparing for another one to hit here
8879441 the amount of preparation meetings and such going on they have changed the whole way they prepare now we are shutting down all projects friday
8879442 it looked like it happened the day before the week before
8879443 go down to the ninth ward now its still flat there are boats down there in the middle of the road shrimp boats in the middle of the road you can drive for 35 miles and theres constant devastation that whole way six flags is still sitting there abandoned you can see all the rides in the distance nothings touched you can go by condominiums that are still abandoned to this day go over the bypasses see stores areas still no life two exits are abandoned in east new orleans
8879444 weve had a tremendous amount of wildlife in the last month
8879445 coyotes are in the process of attacking domesticated animals like ducks and geese weve had a number of reports of attacks
8879446 its an increasing problem people should be made aware of
8879447 what better time to attack than when the birds are out and fair game
8879448 this is a great day for the united states navy and for the men and women of electric boat
8879449 we had high hopes for the new hampshire and im happy to say its exceeded all expectations
8879450 thats a pretty remarkable accomplishment this is the most complete virginia class ship at delivery of any in the class
8879451 say the mission is to gather information about weapons of mass destruction
8879452 the special ops can go ashore gather information and come back totally undetected
8879453 i believe we need to focus our discussion on a price and i believe the community is best served with a school that costs 40 million or less with a hopeful reimbursement rate of 15 million from the state
8879454 the community needs a realistic expectation of what this building will mean to their tax bill
8879455 my concern is we need to be a little careful of how small it gets we dont want it to eat into programs
8879456 im not sure its a good idea to say weve got to cut into programs over the 50 year life of the school for the sake of four of five million dollars over the course of a 20 year bond
8879457 i think the school board is doing what theyre supposed to do
8879458 our job as a council is to bring it in at a price that will work for everybody were not done yet and theres more work to do
8879459 the save fort rock farm circle anticipated the motion to be removed due to standing in todays hearing we remain fully committed to preserving and protecting the environment the fragile ecosystems of the squamscott river the estuaries of great bay and the historic fort rock farm site
8879460 just because a case is so fully and hotly contested by both highly competent counsel and others just because all that occurred it doesnt mean the decision below is unlawful or unreasonable
8879461 it is in exactly these cases where there is full opportunity to be heard full review if they go through the process right and people participate thats what the process requires the process doesnt require any particular decision
8879462 we learned a lot about how to run a full day session last year
8879463 its a new challenge and i think these kids are more prepared than we were because theyre expected to be
8879464 its wonderful to meet new kids and new families and weve had a lot sign up
8879465 it would be a mutual benefit for the bank and for the town to earn rental income and the bank would improve the space somewhat cosmetic alterations and at the end of the term we would leave you hopefully with a better space than we entered into
8879466 since when did the town get into the business of leasing municipal facilities for retail space
8879467 i am wary of starting to lease town facilities for retail purposes when right now we say we need to expand our office space for the town offices
8879468 it calls for the development of nine 24 unit three story buildings and accessory community buildings and parking as homes for the elderly defined in this proposal as ages 55 and over to be located on one lot with units to be conveyed as condominium units
8879469 the proposed development owned by ciborowski realty trust is located on the westerly side of lafayette road in the single residential zoning district
8879470 they came again aug 12 to ask that the board consider rezoning the land for their project
8879471 theres some commercial areas and some residential it sounds like a great project but is it the best use for the land
8879472 at the august meeting two or three of the planning board members kept posing the question of why not a mixed use development
8879473 or why not affordable work force housing but they seemed not interested
8879474 rather than working with me with the 55 plus project planners are looking to rezone to something a developer would never do
8879475 they are suggesting an office building they talked to me about sewer my developer will bring sewer to route 1 other than the ciborowski land no one will do anything like that they are making it sound like theyre looking out for the best interest of the town but this project will bring three quarters of a million in tax dollars to the town without almost any impact
8879476 to do it though they need sewer and thats what we offered
8879477 i researched affordable housing and it cant happen without sewer the town doesnt want to float a bond and bring sewer to route 1
8879478 i wish theyd call exeter and see what they have to say
8879479 this concept has been tried and tested i wish rye was more receptive
8879480 new hampshire requirements spell it out better than our zoning and we are working to come up with a better definition
8879481 the first proposal was determined not to meet the definition their attorney malcom mcneill said to make progress would we consider rezoning we said why not look at the route 1 corridor on that side of the road
8879482 weve worked with the town for over two years to get to this point
8879483 your town administrator should be commended for his diligence in trying to put this deal forward
8879484 my opinion is that we go into an agreement with the cell tower company and let due process begin
8879485 his vote would have been to not approve the lease and to submit it at the next town meeting
8879486 ive spoken to people and their opinion is that we go forward and see where we end up
8879487 i am moving cross country in sept and am willing to negotiate on price to sell it asap
8879488 its not the same game when its your own kid
8879489 its fun to be here and see all my friends
8879490 we have challenged ourselves as a school to cut our trash production by at least half
8879491 we have also asked for our families to do the same and requested e mail addresses to communicate with the parents instead of paper notices
8879492 if we can instill this practice in our children now then it will be second nature by the time they reach adulthood
8879493 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8879494 published in january 2005 by dr bob blain emeritus professor of sociology at southern illinois university the paper updated an earlier study by dr blain published for the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco in the
8879495 the debts of governments federal state and local corporations farmers home mortgages and consumer commercial and financial debts
8879496 the consistency of the pattern suggests that some imperative is at work something that requires debt to increase
8879497 then i read g r taylors 1950 book hamilton and the national debt which described the debate over alexander hamiltons plan to fund the new economy with borrowed money
8879498 the most revealing account was a speech by the first congressman from georgia james jackson on february 9 1790 in which he predicted that adoption of hamiltons funding plan would lead to the explosive growth of debt
8879499 loans created only the principal interest had to be paid out of principal so payment of interest reduced the money supply and slowed economic activity recovery could come only when new loans were taken out at least equal to interest paid
8879500 as long as the money supply of a nation is created as debt costing interest debt must grow by compound interest
8879501 we are buying more and more in the same amount of time witness the efforts of people to get rid of their excess through yard sales storage units and big trash pickup days and the massive size of what are euphemistically called landfills while two billion people in the world lack basics such as clean water food and shelter americans throw away their microwave ovens televisions computers refrigerators furniture and cars meanwhile acceleration is applauded as increasing productivity its like arguing that cancer is good because it grows
8879502 stop using percentage rates to calculate charges for the use of money
8879503 congress must supply the economy with a money base that is debt free and interest free
8879504 this is a crucial time things are happening we have got some key media people talking and writing about our kind of reforms the inertia is starting to yield things are starting to roll the worsening conditions in 2009 will give us a once in a lifetime chance to be heard above the propaganda
8879505 bringing a student to the highest levels that they can go is what educations about
8879506 a very critical item during the site plan review process
8879507 otherwise its going to be noahs ark youre going to be floating someone needs to take a full look at it or youre going to be in trouble
8879508 we have established that all types of antipsychotics carry an increased risk although the risk might be somewhat higher with the atypical drugs
8879509 we reaffirm that the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided wherever possible
8879510 its a sad day when you have this much money spent on police officers and the poor only have their voice and we cant allow that to be taken from us
8879511 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8879512 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8879513 the latest forecasts for tropical storm gustav suggest a slightly lower chance of major disruptions in oil production
8879514 this is a potentially revolutionary advance in the field of forensics said the papers senior author dr
8879515 by employing the powers of genomic technology it is now possible to know with near certainty that a particular individual was at a particular location even with only trace amounts of dna and even if dozens or even hundreds of others were there too
8879516 as technology advances we need to be prepared to keep evidence that down the road could prove again to be useful said vermeer who heads a bureau of nearly 130 analysts and crime scene investigators
8879517 often stymied because they now search for fewer than 20 dna markers the tgen researchers looked at hundreds of thousands of markers to make their identifications he said
8879518 it opens up a whole new can of worms of whats possible to do forensically said nelson professor of human genetics and psychiatry at uclas david geffen school of medicine nelson contributed to the tgen paper
8879519 an intellectual curiosity by craig while investigating diseases nils homer a former tgen intern who now is working on his doctorate degree in computer science at ucla brought nelson and craig together homer is the papers first author
8879520 we demonstrate an approach for rapidly and sensitively determining whether a trace amount of genomic dna from an individual is present within a complex dna mixture the paper said

8879568 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
8879569 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8879570 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations
8879571 i lost the lottery but this is a winning ticket
8879572 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8879573 they either had a meal here or live here and were walking to the trolley
8879574 i dont think you can come into a state like ohio and have any success at all with a complete free trade policy and lack of concern about the downside of globalization
8879575 this is an issue that would play very very well with a demographic he needs to pick up
8879576 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta
8879577 democrats have to tread lightly because bill clinton was in the white house when nafta passed
8879578 the nafta stuff will in fact come back into the campaign dramatically
8879579 its a contrast that makes a great deal of difference in key states such as ohio pennsylvania and michigan
8879580 the democrats campaign as perfectionists take advantage of the fact that trade is treated with suspicion and harvest votes as critics of trade but being under no obligation to deliver on what they promise
8879581 long road ahead but i think its definitely a good start
8879582 we pray that for all of us this is a point from which we can move forward and truly begin to heal
8879583 it was apparent at this meeting that the governor did not presume kilpatricks innocence
8879584 to the contrary at this meeting the governor and her staff had prepared a blackboard scenario in which his presumption of innocence was ignored and significantly undercut
8879585 the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad
8879586 jobs in michigan and diversifying our economy and getting barack obama elected as president
8879587 as a result of the governors decision to bow to political pressures and move forward with her hearing we have no choice
8879588 ability to be fair and impartial in presiding over the hearings is doubtful

8879613 ich bin entsetzt ber die pl ne der bayerischen staatsregierung dass der inhaltliche schwerpunkt ber diese zeit auf die mittelstufe der weiterf hrenden gymnasien verlegt wird

8879615 weil deutschland mit seiner problematischen geschichte ein ganz wichtiges feld ist
8879616 auch hier zeigt sich dass die ganztagsschule einfach die bessere alternative ist weil dort auch mehr zeit daf r bleibt die wichtigsten geschichtsdaten und themen zu vermitteln
8879617 hes still with us and has a contract but he hasnt featured that much and seems happy with that
8879618 i got a chance because we went to korea i simply wouldnt have got a chance to play otherwise
8879619 i was out of the team and i was proud to play there it was good for my confidence the crowd in korea helped me which was good the people out there are watching our league every week
8879620 the manager didnt say anything but i knew this was a great chance and if i didnt show him what i could do in pre season it would be very difficult to get a chance during the season so i worked very hard to show him what ive got
8879621 i played as a striker in the second game and the manager found out different things so that was quite lucky for me
8879622 i played a few games as a striker at reading but never played in that position since roy hodgson came here until then but it was great that i did
8879623 im so delighted to be playing because i didnt play much last season we
8879624 i didnt get many chances but i never thought about moving to another club i wanted to succeed here and just decided to keep trying and working hard
8879625 now ive played the first two matches and im so happy
8879626 it was difficult to get used to playing here when i first arrived last year and to get into the team it took time to see the way we played and what the manager wanted
8879627 i came here as a winger but i dont care where i play playing every weeks the most important thing for me
8879628 i worked very hard pre season to try and get into the team and im trying to do my best
8879629 i dont like to think about past things i always think about the future and im very delighted to play
8879630 i will keep trying to work hard to stay in the side we have many strikers like andy johnson here now and i have to show to the manager in every game that i can play
8879631 but ive also got used to what he wants i have to work very hard for the team and i changed my style im a striker but i have to defend for the team and he likes it
8879632 we dont have a league game for three weeks and this game was very important because we lost the last game so this is a great result for us
8879633 now we can look at it as having time to rest and prepare for the next game and after beating arsenal we will be very confident
8879634 shall not erect upon the piece of land any buildings except public baths a free library or other public building
8879635 the covenants have never been broken no buildings other than public buildings have been erected on this land what they should be doing is protecting the victorian character
8879636 we do not believe that this design is yet good enough it would set an inappropriate precedent for development in ealing
8879637 the council does not believe that the covenant prevents redevelopment of the site the council is aware of the details of the documents for dickens yard the site has a complex history
8879638 ive lived here for five years and its always been bad it got to a point where it was really terrible with blood and excrement on the walls
8879639 after two years of telling the housing association that something bad was going to happen finally something has happened
8879640 apparently the guy had been sleeping and hed had an overdose and passed away the police took him away and left all the things behind the duvet and blankets and the rubbish its terrible
8879641 notting hill housing have completely ignored us theres no way to talk to them were living in a place where someone has been found dead and they dont even care
8879642 we apologise for any difficulties that residents have experienced in dealing with us this is not the level of service that we aim to deliver
8879643 notting hill is extremely sorry that the discussions were not resumed before such a terrible event took place and wholeheartedly believes that preventative security measures may have helped
8879644 it looked like there was a birthday party going on but at about 1 30am dozens and dozens of people were coming down the road
8879645 shortly after that all the noise started with people screaming and shouting
8879646 i saw one lad running up and down swinging a baseball bat threatening people and others standing with sticks
8879647 then there was a gun shot the girls screamed and everyone scattered in all directions but then they started coming back amazingly because if it was me id have carried on running there was another shot somewhere else but i dont know where
8879648 i saw two figures crouching down by the motorcycle museum and it turned out they were armed police one stayed there and the other made his way into a front garden across the road they had guns like you see them carrying at airports
8879649 then all of a sudden about half a dozen police cars came from one end and half a dozen from the other and blocked them in and the armed officers showed themselves
8879650 officers then started breaking them all up and sending them on their way there were about 30 or 40 of them at this stage
8879651 an ambulance turned up but it didnt stay very long
8879652 police spent until about 3pm the following afternoon doing forensics and i heard they found a bullet or cartridge or something

8879660 this attempt to glorify the role of the rir in the occupation of afghanistan is part of a well choreographed effort to normalise britains other occupation in ireland
8879661 in the last few weeks this has taken the form of a massive advertising campaign for the territorial army and now moves to parade troops through the streets of the six counties
8879662 all the parades in the world cant hide the fact that the british army in ireland is a force of occupation the fact that the rir are locally recruited mercenaries in no way lessens their role in that occupation
8879663 whether its in ireland afghanistan or anywhere else the rir has played a shameful part in britains wars
8879664 while the politicians advocating this parade are currently pontificating about peace in ireland the soldiers they want to honour are waging a brutal campaign against the people of afghanistan
8879665 i am liable to pay the charges but most of the services are already provided by the council and this is a grey area i am not liable for paying charges twice for the same thing
8879666 i was surprised when i received the bid invoice as since i opened the shop in october i have been asking to get more information from the council and the people from bid
8879667 i know that legally if it is something i have voted on then i have to pay but what bid provides for us we already pay for in business rates
8879668 he kind of made it pretty obvious and opened up early so i knew he was going there to my left i dived early and made the save
8879669 ive not been bad at penalties since i was at school and i think my ratios been pretty good since i turned pro i think ive saved four out of six penalties in my career so it has been good
8879670 i like to stay big and dont like to go down early and sometimes youve just got to guess
8879671 youve got to be lucky sometimes but id like to think that sometimes i can read what he is going to do and make the save
8879672 it was a dive and obviously he knew that so the way i see it it was justice that i saved the penalty
8879673 i came into the team then was out of it then back into it again obviously thats made me a stronger person and ive got that experience from last season and can perform well this year
8879674 today in the first half we were obviously on top but the second half proved quite tough but we ground the result out and the boys are all happy
8879675 bens attitude since hes been back with us has been first class and hes a changed character
8879676 last year helped him a lot with the ups and downs that he had and sometimes as a young professional goalkeeper if you can come through these times of adversity it really helps you
8879677 his focus and attitude this year has been absolutely spot on and i dont see any reason why he cant go and be a top goalkeeper were just pleased to have him for this year and if he goes on to be a top keeper then it shows that brentford have done well
8879678 im always disappointed im a perfectionist and want us to go and win three and four nil every week but things dont work like that
8879679 youve got to give credit to the other team sometimes
8879680 we never really got going in the second half if you do that then you give chances away having said that we got another clean sheet in this league youre going to have to come away to places and win 1 0 and do it scrappy
8879681 we can see that when were attacking weve got players who can produce that bit of quality that gives us chances and we just need to be a bit more ruthless in what we do
8879682 we maybe wouldnt have gone through and won this game last year but we have a stronger squad and were stronger mentally
8879683 they came out in the second half and gave us a massive kick up the backside with two goals in two minutes and this game isnt about leading all the time sometimes you have to come from behind and i thought the last five or 10 minutes we showed a bit of character
8879684 winning when youve been trailing is always good for team morale and we wanted to win this game it was near enough the team we put out against arsenal
8879685 i may watch the video again and be hard on myself as i usually am i gave a few bad balls away which i didnt like but i scored in the end so that got me a little bit out of jail and then danny got me even more out of jail
8879686 the first five minutes of the second half and even the first 25 of the half was a disaster
8879687 these are the games where we feel lucky to come back and still win it even though we didnt do well
8879688 it was an entirely different game on saturday and we didnt cope as well im just really happy that we got two great goals from our midfielders at the end and managed to get the win
8879689 someones got to win the competition and we definitely hope we can go on a good run and as we get closer to the final it gets more interesting

8879727 id immediately say stand up and would stand in front of them and say im 52

8879734 we know the name of the mother of the baby john edwards did or did not sire but we are in the dark as to who may have authored the scheme that cost thousands of people their jobs and their savings and that gave the financial markets a major kick down the mountain a fall that will continue to take millions of us with them
8879735 we were really working hard to say to people dont think because we havent heard any pools are positive to become complacent and say we are ok this year
8879736 this takes a task force and an already existing commission and makes it one thats ongoing all the time so the department of health and human services gets together with the department of agriculture department of environmental services and they keep track and pay attention with whats going on with the vectors that carry eee and wnv

8879750 some people might not be too comfortable with public speaking so its a good way to show off for friends and family by reading your own writing
8879751 some people have made jokes about wearing berets and bringing bongos its interesting just to see what type of writing shows up
8879752 we are proud we are brave sitting here by these graves just for oil what price we pay how the wolf cries to this day
8879753 its not the same game when its your own kid
8879754 its fun to be here and see all my friends
8879755 we have two boys in the palumbos that are playing at a higher level than most of the kids in the united states
8879756 steve is in the top 25 in the national pool and robbie is in the top 100 or 200
8879757 when you have two kids on the field like that the level of play comes up and everyone tries to emulate them you have to be careful to not get caught watching them but helping them
8879758 the higher level players have to be patient and let the other kids skills come up
8879759 all these kids are excellent athletes so we have to wait for them to gain touch and decision making ability in order to be a cohesive unit
8879760 the same sort of thing happened last year where we just tried to make it cohesive team unit where you have a diversity of players from kids nationally ranked to those who are seasonal players
8879761 another strength we have is the leadership of our captain josh diburro
8879762 he makes sure the work rate is up gives pep talks and adds to our continuity we have the quiet elite leadership of steve and rob palumbo and the vocal active leadership of josh diburro
8879763 we were just a bounce or two away from the semifinals

8879765 i know this team is capable because they get better each day and with each practice
8879766 this team plays very well together and trusts each other on and off the field if you have team chemistry like this anything is possible during the season and when the playoffs begin
8879767 residents should make sure not to leave anything of value inside their vehicles

8879771 i believe that as educators there are more than 20 of these assets which we have direct influence on and as this district is dedicated to educating the whole child and this strong bond between rcfy and the schools here exists so productively we are all developing the assets of our youth which gives our children a tremendous advantage to succeed in life

8879808 from two miles to maybe three and a half i had this older lady driving alongside of me with two small dogs in the car
8879809 the lead police officer was signaling her to get off the road but she was a little unaware

8879811 ive run it two or three times in the past
8879812 my dad took me there back in 96 for my first 10k i was confused as to why no one was given a shirt at the registration table he told me that id have to come in the top 100 to get one but he made it sound impossible

8879814 i had a goal of breaking 32 00 which ive only done once before back in 2002
8879815 i hit the mile all alone in 4 57 and two miles in 10 00 unfortunately i didnt wear my watch i was relying on people being at the mile splits but all i found were orange markers in the road without a person in sight
8879816 after the woman in the car left i ran the rest of the race alone
8879817 i gave a few glances back as i was starting to feel the effects of a fast start but only saw a pack a ways back i thought that they might have a chance at catching me but i lucked out
8879818 basically i worked here and there but really got my training back on the right track

8879890 i didnt go to united because it was brilliant pay i went there for that great chance instead of being at home for ten weeks
8879891 i had an offer to stay on at united in 2007 but there is no talk about that now
8879892 it isnt 100 percent that henke will stay with us
8879893 we havent talked to henke about this he hasnt told us that he is looking at offers so that i do not know about that possibility
8879894 we fully appreciate henke in one respect this is football related but it is also for how much he means for the club but i neither want to nor can speculate now
8879895 we need someone from the highest level to clarify for all of us administrators players and referees
8879896 is striking with the open hand to the face of a player not a category 2 offence which will result in a penalty of four weeks we need that clarified at the highest level to clear up the confusion
8879897 the official guide of the gaa says that a category 2 offence which is punishable by a four week suspension includes striking or attempting to strike with the hand
8879898 now it was clear for all to see that aidan omahony was struck with the hand on sunday and the degree of force has nothing at all to do with it
8879899 it could have been the track that he didnt like it could have been the ground of it could have been both
8879900 but he came back fine there was nothing physically wrong and we will press ahead with training him for the leger
8879901 he may also run in the leger but we will decide late on whether he takes his chance

8879905 but its not just that its the atmosphere horses pick up on atmosphere
8879906 aidan is the one who creates the atmosphere in the yard

8879935 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8879936 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8879937 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8879938 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8879939 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8879940 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8879941 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8879942 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
8879943 obese patients with asthma are more difficult to treat because their response to bronchoconstriction is exaggerated and gives the impression that the asthma is worse
8879944 they may well have worse symptoms but not as a result of underlying airway inflammation still the typical response is often to increase their inhaled anti inflammatory therapy this is unlikely to provide the answer and may even do harm the answer lies in dealing with the obesity itself
8879945 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8879946 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
8879947 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
8879948 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
8879949 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8879950 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8879951 since preterm infants continue to have significant cardiorespiratory events after discharge from the hospital our study may help identify the infants at risk for attenuated recovery from hypoxemic episodes while at home
8879952 furthermore it might help distinguish the infants who will arouse in response to hypoxemia the infants identified to be at risk can subsequently be further investigated and or monitored at home
8879953 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8879954 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8879955 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8879956 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8879957 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8879958 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
8879959 the healthy user effect is everywhere you dont want it to be
8879960 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8879961 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8879962 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8879963 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8879964 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8879965 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8879966 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8879967 our findings highlight the importance of both screening for illnesses such as asthma in children who are abused and of being aware of the possibility of abuse in children with asthma
