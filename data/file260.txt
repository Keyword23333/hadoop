2600029 we have frozen the preceptor accounts in order to review them to ensure that they support the missions of the facilities
2600030 the sheriffs office is as busy as its ever been
2600031 our officers are serving pretty close to 1 200 criminal papers a month and over a thousand civil papers a month we answer a little over 2 000 calls per month and that keeps the officers very busy on the road
2600032 our officers are also as busy as theyve ever been transporting mental patients throughout the state with an average of about 1 000 a year or pretty close to three per day all this leads to a very full jail
2600033 ive talked with the district attorneys office and the judges just this past week to ask them for help with our population problems they have assured me they would do everything they possibly could
2600034 we had to transport 11 inmates to another facility to keep from being overcrowded with extra problems
2600035 id like to thank the county manager and all the departments for their continued help throughout with us from operations to finance we all work together and do a good job
2600036 id like to thank you the county commissioners for your help and support in helping us keep the citizens of halifax county safe i was looking at a statistic that showed there were 283 times our officers got out of the car in a threatening situation that is somebody putting their life on the line to protect the citizens of halifax county
2600037 we allocated some more deputy positions for you earlier this year are those positions filled now and where are we on that
2600038 we have two officer positions open and we have two jail detention officer positions open
2600039 with our beds being 85 were over populated and have been for the last 10 years
2600040 ive looked into ways of out sourcing different ways to get rid of inmates thats a terrible way of saying it but we do
2600041 weve worked with our department of social services with the child support division a lot trying to get people in and out
2600042 ive got some in jail with a 200 fine and theyve been in jail 75 days
2600043 it costs us more to keep them in jail than it would for us to pay the fine for them
2600044 i talked with them the child support people last week with mrs beaver and they are looking into that situation now
2600045 we have three and theyve got double population in them today
2600046 they put a mat on the floor and double them up theyre doing that today
2600047 one of our worst areas is probably the female population
2600048 we have room for 10 and when that population becomes 17 to 18 that becomes a very very big problem
2600049 a month ago i met with the child support people trying to get some of the people out and they increased by 12 so i decided not to go back over there
2600050 look buddy its rude to ask a girls age and to your question yes that is my age i just look young
2600051 might i suggest a bloody mary we have a special variant for you that you might enjoy
2600052 thats the bloody baron compliments from another guest i gather it is to your taste blood born
2600053 i need some information ive been advised that i would be able to receive an answer here
2600054 im looking for someone a dj goes by the name seirei
2600055 however seirei sama is a busy person and will not entertain unannounced guests she is how shall i put it selective
2600056 i will need to forward your request should you desire a meeting that is all i can do
2600057 so you know about her being this blood born as well
2600058 seirei sama is far beyond mere kindred tyro not even the nobles will cross such a one do not presume that your immortality in any way preserves you from the wrath of an ancient
2600059 i am merely warning you about rash action against forces i suspect you do not fully understand child
2600060 i can still forward your request but any meeting will only be on terms can you accept that
2600061 i dont care if shes god or even a fanged version of jesus fucking christ no one and i mean no one tells reina what to do
2600062 you can take your warning and shove it up your ass
2600063 does my lady pass judgment i can make the necessary arrangements
2600064 that is not needful the covenant can keep their hands off my territory i will take care of it should it become a problem
2600065 lord knows i need the diversion its a slow decade
2600066 as you wish my lady is there anything else my humble self can do to aid you
2600067 i dont care if shes god or even a fanged version of jesus fucking christ no one and i mean no one tells reina what to do
2600068 you can take your warning and shove it up your ass
2600069 i heard something and sat straight up in bed and smelled the smoke
2600070 the kid shenego definitely has some mental health issues going to jail wont help him he needs rehabilitation
2600071 we agreed to give you a chance ive read your mental health reports and essentially what we have here is that you could go one way or another
2600072 but im warning you right now if you dont follow the conditions youre going to jail i dont want you coming in here with some sob story
2600073 he has accepted responsibility and is in counseling today was his first opportunity to face the victims and start to make amends
2600074 what the judge did by his sentence was to put a hammer against this guys head
2600075 while we would have liked a longer minimum term were satisfied with the maximum that will have this man under supervision for a good portion of his productive years
2600076 ive got major brand association behind me i dont need a flashy can
2600077 whoa i thought this was fiji water good thing these logos are here or id have never known
2600078 im a gigantic field what worries could i possibly have besides lack of proper irrigation and also wildfires
2600079 long as ya dont get any license plates most athese cars are hot
2600080 im hoping to alleviate that stigma especially when it comes to asian culture
2600081 especially for asians and japanese because of the second world war internment camps and all that stuff where you were treated as second class citizens like you were not a human being
2600082 i wouldnt swim in the pool i thought i was contaminating it i thought i was poisoning the air
2600083 i was an honour student had a lot friends a lot going for me then everything was gone my hopes and dreams all vanished
2600084 he could be abusive and i said some abusive things
2600085 theyre not mentioned in the community even the chinese word for depression is very complicated the word makes you uncomfortable at the sight of it
2600086 i would go off my medication then get delusional and psychotic and end up back in the hospital
2600087 i had a fear of people breaking in to my home and not hearing them so i stayed off my medication i had all that background as an outreach worker but did not have the insight to seek help
2600088 in some ways i do feel vulnerable telling the world i have a mental illness
2600089 mr li im sure had lots of stress going through so much transition
2600090 a lot of immigrants coming to canada from china have a big adjustment
2600091 as soon as you mention mental illness they try to deny it right away whether they recognize they have some of the symptoms or not
2600092 this is very sad but this is the reality theyre a forgotten group until someone acts dangerous or violent in public making it worse
2600093 with support and treatment these people can function and go back in the community
2600094 i think the public is very backward when it comes to mental health education
2600095 how is it that a g8 country one of the most wealthy and well educated has such a huge section of the population with a nearly medieval understanding of mental health and mental illness
2600096 lets say li had been born in 2080 he goes to school and learns how his brain and emotions work talking about mental illness is as easy as talking about obesity and diabetes
2600097 his family talks about it his church talks about it then in adolescence li develops schizophrenia his youth pastor and his family say we need to go to a doctor he gets all the help he needs and never comes down with full blown psychosis
2600098 there are very very few services available in the city and province for people coming from other countries
2600099 certainly a lot of people with churches and other religion affiliated organizations have been working with immigrants
2600100 but there arent really any organized or professional counselling services available to that population
2600101 a lot of our cultures are based on paternalism which makes it even more difficult for men to disclose mental illness
2600102 the no 1 health issue among immigrants is mental health and depression
2600103 so there i was just trying to my oil changed sitting there like everyone else in the waiting room reading a
2600104 well we had to give you an alignment and also installed new brakes and pads and gave you a fuel filter and calibrated your flux capacitor and we had to re gauge your allspark plugs
2600105 goodness i cannot tell you how many times such rude people throw things at me and call me obscene names my lord i am programmed to speak over six million forms of communication but does anyone know what a faglicking gutterwhore jewtramp is
2600106 everyday this sort of thing occurs old chap i must say that other than the goodwill currently being done by non profit charities in the africas i have lost all hope as a philanthropist forsooth being of robot origins means i have no credit and the lads at the country club repeatedly attempt abject physical harm to my person

2600205 the freshman class is pretty good from what ive seen so far i think they can really push for playing time this year
2600206 he made a big impact on the community and a lot of people in law enforcement and its an honor to remember him this way today
2600207 he was just a dynamite guy to work for a good person down to earth never looked down on anybody no matter what rank he wore on his collar everybody in the department was the same and equal in his eyes and he would do everything he could to help anybody
2600208 he had more than enough time in to be retired already and so he came up because he wanted to give back so much to the country
2600209 cause at the end of the day long as theres two people left on the planet
2600210 religious moral philosophical and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development but religion morality philosophy political science and law constantly survived this change
2600211 there are besides eternal truths such as freedom justice etc that are common to all states of society but communism abolishes eternal truths it abolishes all religion and all morality instead of constituting them on a new basis it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience
2600212 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2600213 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2600220 what could be done to improve traffic in new york city you can suggest anything except for two obvious answers congestion pricing the favorite of traffic engineers and economists but not politicians and more police officers to enforce traffic laws were looking for creative solutions to specific problems like cars blocking intersections and for general ideas to improve traffic flow
2600221 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2600222 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2600223 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2600224 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2600225 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2600226 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2600227 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2600228 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2600229 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2600230 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2600231 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2600232 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2600233 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2600237 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2600238 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2600239 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2600240 we just didnt feel like at this time we could prove it beyond a reasonable doubt
2600241 dr bass feels terrible about the passing of these individuals
2600242 they were his patients and he treated them but he was not responsible legally or otherwise for their unfortunate deaths
2600243 he has a complete and utter disdain for human life the laws the regulations
2600244 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2600245 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2600246 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving
2600247 venho bem e hoje a equipe deles se abriu e fui feliz
2600248 esse o esp rito do nosso grupo e pensando jogo a jogo estamos atingindo nossos objetivos
2600249 obriga o para as pretens es do s o paulo no campeonato brasileiro
2600250 vencemos hoje em casa e agora ir l no ol mpico e vencer confronto direto se quisermos o t tulo tem que vencer l n o tem jeito
2600251 a arbitragem n o foi bem hoje acho que deram uma bandeira para ele auxiliar para torcer na arquibancada n o sei eu queria saber como ele viu impedimento 40 segundos depois do gol quando o rbitro havia dado e a bola j hav amos comemorado e a bola j estava no meio de campo
2600252 de repente passou um vt na cabe a dele e a ele lembrou de algo gostaria de saber como viu o impedimento n o d para entender
2600253 erramos bastante hoje principalmente nos passes a posse de bola que tivemos contra o vasco por exemplo passou longe hoje tivemos dificuldades em campo e n o conseguimos repetir uma boa atua o
2600254 acabamos levando um sufoco do goi s mas assim mesmo n o h nenhum jogo f cil no campeonato e o importante no final acabou sendo a vit ria
2600255 ele errou ao dar impedimento no gol do dagoberto eu acho al m disso acho que j havia errado no p nalti do iarley e isso nos complicou
2600256 mardy um grande jogador mas n o lhe dei chance

2600263 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2600264 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important

2600272 the rm10 hourly allowance for on call doctors is grossly unfair
2600273 on the other hand our counterparts at the health clinics are being paid rm80 hourly for treating patients with coughs and flu
2600274 we dont have to work long hours and the workload is also not that heavy at health clinics
2600275 being on call is something that all government doctors have to do while working overtime is voluntary you cannot compare working overtime with being on call
2600276 closing the strait of hormuz for an unlimited period of time would be very easy

2600291 yes ive been to paris tennessee on several occasions but i never stayed in a hotel there
2600292 hi im calling on behalf of the florida republican party and john mccain the 27 year old said hunched over a stack of papers one night last week with a cell phone pressed to his cheek
2600293 currently in the race for president do you support john mccain barack obama or are you undecided john mccain okay
2600294 whatever theyre doing on the grass roots campaign clearly is not working said republican consultant doug mcalarney of tallahassee
2600295 its clear if they want to run a grass roots campaign they have to do something different
2600296 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2600297 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2600298 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2600299 why do you want to live in new york city
2600300 next we can go to the playground the botanic gardens or the museum they are all right here
2600301 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2600302 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2600303 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2600304 i think any place you live has its own set of pros and cons
2600305 sometimes youre just ready to deal with a different set
2600306 you wont find an entire city free from those companies
2600307 not even in moscow or tokyo the best you can hope for is a neighborhood with a sense of character
2600308 i have some girlfriends at work who have recently had babies they said that people ask how they can leave and go to work every day but the truth is that they are relieved to have the break they feel guilty for thinking that they werent prepared to feel that way they read all the books
2600309 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2600310 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2600311 negotiating any piece of legislation through the senate is always a challenge
2600312 i have had discussions with some of the cross bench senators theyll continue and we will continue to argue vigorously for fuelwatch
2600313 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity
2600314 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2600315 its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2600316 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2600317 i always have believed that the australian public make a very clear distinction between voting for a territory government or voting for a state government and voting for a federal government
2600318 they understand fully all the implications of our federal system so i dont draw too much into the northern territory result and i wont draw too much from the west australian result other than to say we know it will be a tough election
2600319 but the liberals have been very much in disarray here wa and wa premier alan carpenter s done a good job in difficult circumstances so whilst we think it will be tough were confident that alan carpenter will do well
2600320 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2600321 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign i think it is always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results on to federal results or vice versa
2600322 a russian humanitarian convoy has come under fire panic is growing among the local population and the number of refugees is increasing there are reports of ethnic cleansing in some villages the situation is ripe for a humanitarian catastrophe
2600323 mccains initial statement put him more closely in line with the moral clarity and american exceptionalism projected by president bushs first term
2600324 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2600325 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government said obama spokesman hari sevugan
2600326 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2600327 were putting an emphasis on bluegrass music rather than old timing this year
2600328 we have at least four bands from the bay area and central

2600347 fiji is one of the few countries in which the pm does not have a house
2600348 awesome sports service your write ups on your nfl picks are great and informative betvega com has the sports betting information you need to provide soccer betting information
2600349 that is exactly why i am here right now because i dont want to deal with this exact situation tomorrow morning at 4 30 am when you open and miss my 6 am flight
2600350 portals and other distributions services impose their own rules and limitations supposedly indie friendly distribution options like steam and instant action still have subjective gatekeepers
2600351 if you want your game to make money you have to consider what will sell and this means adapting your pure creative vision to match the real world
2600352 since we are a small developer that has a hard time getting attention you would think we would have very little piracy
2600353 unfortunately thats not the case at all its depressing how many sites are pirating depths of peril
2600354 saw the numbers resident evil 4 it was a fairly easy business case

2600358 the attacks are occurring in georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia and mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2600359 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2600360 whatever site is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this site is not safe and they should know this
2600361 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2600362 mr saakashvili must do two things he must withdraw all forces from south ossetia and sign a legally binding document to never use force against south ossetia again
2600363 have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out

2600377 se lleg a esta instancia de transferir aerol neas al estado ya que los actores titulares del grupo empresario marsans manifestaron su inter s de retirarse del mercado aerocomercial
2600378 algunos legisladores parece que tienen una memoria tan fr gil
2600379 no hicieron nada durante el periodo de privatizaci n que dur 18 a os
2600380 en 1990 aerol neas se entreg con un capital activo important simo y ya en 2001 se vendi por un euro con un concurso de acreedores muy grande
2600381 en 2003 cuando se inici la gesti n de n stor kirchner se discuti fuertemente sobre la participaci n y los controles del estado
2600382 el estado ten a en aerol neas menos de 1 por ciento de participaci n y en austral nada por esa discusi n en 2006 se recuper la posibilidad de tener dos directores y un s ndico
2600383 se recuper el poder de veto en cuanto a temas estrat gicos que el estado hab a perdido

2600386 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2600387 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2600388 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2600389 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2600390 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2600391 mijn man werkte op de luchthaven van zaventem als ober ik werkte als hostess aan de balie recht tegenover zijn caf the flying tigers dat was in 2000 wij gingen daar elke morgen met de dames van de balie onze koffie drinken op een dag vroeg hij mij wil je eens met mij meegaan naar de film ik heb meteen ja gezegd omdat hij zo lief lachte en zo is alles begonnen ik was eenentwintig het enige wat ik wist was dat samir uit een kleine oase helemaal in het zuiden van marokko kwam tinj dad en dat hij n broer en vijf zussen had
2600392 toen we elkaar een paar maanden kenden ben ik me vanzelf in de islam gaan verdiepen ik was er heel nieuwsgierig naar maar mijn man liet nauwelijks iets los over zijn geloof ik heb dan maar alles in mijn eentje opgezocht via nederlandstalige websites op het internet
2600393 je bekeren tot de islam is vrij eenvoudig je hoeft enkel de geloofsbelijdenis er is geen god behalve allah en mohammed is de boodschapper van allah driemaal op te zeggen maar op een dag vroeg iemand me of ik wel officieel bekeerd was ik wist niet waarover ze het had ik heb meteen contact opgenomen met de grote moskee hier in brussel en ben er door imam taouil ontvangen hij was onder de indruk van mijn kennis van de islam maar was verbaasd dat ik de koran alleen in het nederlands kon reciteren hij heeft me dan nog een kans gegeven ik heb toen de zinnetjes in de oorspronkelijke taal het arabisch van buiten geleerd hoewel ik niet alles begreep daarna was ik meteen geslaagd en mocht ik me officieel moslim noemen
2600394 soms hebben we het gevoel dat we ons voortdurend moeten verantwoorden en bemiddelen tussen niet moslims en moslims dat is heel vermoeiend door de familie van mijn man ben ik onmiddellijk aanvaard dat vind ik nu net zo mooi aan die godsdienst iedereen is welkom volgens de koran moet men iedereen in zijn vrijheid laten je hebt niet het recht om over iemand anders te oordelen alles wat een individu doet is tussen hem en god dat is iets waarvan ik vind dat we in het westen veel kunnen leren hier heeft iedereen altijd wel iets te zeggen over iemand van de schoenen die hij draagt tot de kleur van zijn ogen en het feit of hij dik is het stoort me dat alles hier zo sterk op het uiterlijk gericht is
2600395 ik heb al snel de marokkaanse cultuur overgenomen ik draag meestal een djellaba en hoofddoek omdat ik dat nu eenmaal graag draag maar veel mensen zien alleen een hoofddoek en denken automatisch buitenlandse
2600396 de mensen zijn vaak racistisch zonder dat ze het zelf beseffen zo krijg ik dikwijls op straat te horen ze zouden die vreemdelingen naar huis moeten sturen dan denk ik wat met de bekeerlingen wij zijn hier thuis we spreken de taal en kennen de cultuur ondertussen is mijn man hier ook volledig ge ntegreerd hij is dertien jaar geleden naar belgi gekomen heeft aan de universiteit van bergen gestudeerd en werkt nu al bijna tien jaar in zaventem waar hij tot management assistant opgeklommen is hij heeft de belgische nationaliteit en spreekt perfect nederlands ook ik krijg geregeld complimenten omdat ik zo goed nederlands spreek geen wonder ik studeer regentaat nederlands aan de ehsal red
2600397 je kunt zeggen dat het geloof er bij mij met de paplepel ingegoten is ik kom uit een heel religieuze katholieke familie ik ging elke week naar de mis deed mijn eerste communie volgde de catecheselessen en deed mijn vormsel maar er ontbrak iets achteraf gezien denk ik dat het vooral de samenhang was het grotere geheel we kwamen n keer per week samen in de kerk en dat was het dan in de islam is heb je naast die wekelijkse bijeenkomsten ook een hele levensvisie waar je achter staat je bent er constant mee bezig van als je opstaat tot als je gaat slapen
2600398 mijn oma is de enige familie die ik heb zij is ook diegene die mij opnieuw in huis genomen heeft toen ik zwanger was van maarten een paar maanden na zijn geboorte heb ik samir leren kennen op het werk hij heeft maarten meteen erkend maarten is vernoemd naar mijn moeder martine als eerbetoon mijn vijfjarige dochtertje farrah arabisch voor blijdschap heeft dan wel weer een arabische naam mijn oma was helemaal niet gelukkig met mijn keuze tot aan mijn huwelijksdag mocht ik niet bij samir overnachten nu heeft ze de situatie min of meer geaccepteerd maar het blijft toch heel moeilijk voor haar
2600399 wij blijven belgen en we blijven onze culturele en culinaire gewoontes behouden straks tijdens de ramadan in september zullen we wel weer elke avond typisch marokkaanse gerechten eten zoals de harira soep en msemmen broodjes maar de rest van het jaar eten we evengoed mosselen of andere belgische lekkerijen zelf hou ik er bijvoorbeeld van om bij de muntthee boudoirs mijn lievelingskoekjes te eten in plaats van de typisch marokkaanse gebakjes

2600420 er moeten metrolijnen naar vlaanderen en walloni komen nmbs voorstadstreinen zullen niet volstaan om de verkeersknoop te ontwarren
2600421 toen ik als jong journalist begon vroeg ik of ik over de spoorwegen mocht schrijven mijn bazen haalden hun schouders op laat hem maar doen dachten ze de trein is als vervoersmiddel toch afgeschreven
2600422 er ligt toch al een tramlijn wat is het probleem in frankrijk toch het land waar franstalige belgische politici graag naar kijken is zoiets onmogelijk daar geldt het principe van de utilit publique er mag nog een koning wonen als het algemeen belang bepaalt dat een tramlijn het beste is dan zal de franse staat daar ook zo over beslissen soms zijn ze daar wat te ver in gegaan de aanleg van de hst lijn van parijs naar lyon hebben ze zonder boe of ba in een rechte lijn over de heuvels laten rijden vandaag zullen de fransen het met iets meer omzichtigheid doen met goede communicatie en inspraak maar het principe van het algemeen belang blijft vooropstaan
2600423 tramlijnen zijn de hefboom gebleken voor de ontwikkeling van de stad zelfs al heeft de stad de tramlijn niet echt nodig in valenciennes bijvoorbeeld is men de huizen gaan renoveren de straten opnieuw gaan aanleggen dankzij de nieuwe tram en het kan allemaal op korte termijn in frankrijk in orl ans heeft men achttien kilometer tram aangelegd in minder dan twee jaar dwars door de stad
2600424 de nmbs vervoert nu al een maximaal aantal mensen naar brussel met de tunnel schuman josaphat zit er nog wat rek op maar als dit land wil dat de mensen de auto inruilen voor het openbaar vervoer dan is er meer nodig
2600425 ik ben geen politicus maar voor de mobiliteit is de boedelscheiding van het openbaar vervoer in ons land geen goede zaak geweest in brussel leidt het tot concurrentie hoe kan het dat de lijn bussen inzet die tot in het hart van de stad rijden terwijl ze de mensen met grote regelmaat naar metrostations zou kunnen brengen
2600426 zon supermetrolijn brengt de reiziger in n ruk vanuit aalst tot in de wetstraat
2600427 er kan bijvoorbeeld aan eppegem aan de e19 een transferium worden gebouwd waar de autos kunnen parkeren en de automobilisten rechtstreeks overstappen op de metro
2600428 maar als we keuzes moeten maken voor een betere mobiliteit dan zou dat soort argumenten niet mogen meespelen we moeten belgi durven te bekijken als n groot verstedelijkt gebied taalgrenzen zijn geen transportgrenzen het argument van de verfransing houdt trouwens geen steek de nmbs rijdt toch ook van vlaanderen naar brussel en vice versa en de mivb is net zo goed een tweetalige maatschappij die zou dat perfect kunnen
2600429 ik heb mijn mening wat moeten bijstellen metro gaat zoveel sneller gemiddeld dertig per uur een tram haalt er maximaal twintig voor antwerpen is het bovendien een goede zaak gebleken dat die paar tunnels er nu liggen hoewel er geen metro doorrijdt
2600430 ik heb tientallen jaren lang gestreden voor slimme verkeerslichten voor het tramverkeer wat in vele landen al een evidentie is maar in antwerpen en brussel blijkbaar niet de tram laat honderd meter voor het verkeerskruispunt het licht op groen springen de winst is enorm energiezuiniger comfortabeler voor de reiziger en goedkoper in personeelskosten en de automobilist wat die ook moge denken ondervindt er geen hinder van
2600431 in zwitserland gaan de mensen in avondtoilet naar de opera met de tram
2600432 in z rich neemt 34 procent van de mensen het openbaar vervoer nog eens achttien procent combineert het openbaar vervoer met de fiets nog eens achttien procent combineert het openbaar vervoer met de auto slechts elf procent gebruikt alleen de auto negen procent combineert auto fiets en openbaar vervoer als brussel een autoluwe stad wil worden dan is dit het model waar we naartoe moeten
2600433 twintig geleden zei een mobiliteitsprofessor in de krant de mensen laten nog eerder hun biefstuk staan dan hun auto veel is er nog niet veranderd
2600434 ik vraag het me soms ook af de mensen zijn er rijker dan hier dus daar kan het niet aan liggen misschien is het de discipline de hoge kwaliteit van het openbaar vervoer wie zal het zeggen
2600435 we felt the race probably came off as good as it could have
2600436 in hindsight there might have been one or two little things we could have done different but we have no experience at running races like that
2600437 i was standing right down there watching his car burn i was sure there was no way in the world anyone could survive he backed it into the wall it burst into flames and rolled back down to the bottom of the track it just burned and there was no motion
2600438 but all of a sudden he just got out walked away from the car went up to the back of the wall and lit up a cigarette the only thing they saved out of that car was the seat they said even the radiator burned it was incredible
2600439 fred campbell has a move in turn four that nobody has ever matched
2600440 he has passed more cars coming through turn four than anyone else i know he has a beautiful move going on the inside
2600441 butch miller was awfully good as far as aggressiveness goes randy sweet was awfully good
2600442 when i first started driving the car at the beginning of the season it wasnt supposed to be like this
2600443 i was getting my license and i was just looking to get seat time and then i won our first race it has been snowballing ever since we have been first or second all year it is definitely a lot bigger than what we planned for and what i imagined it would be
2600444 im in a fortunate position to have a good crew and to have paul smith as the crew chief we have a car that has a good shot at winning the championship
2600445 when i was racing my top alcohol dragster i was known as double 0 spence because a perfect light would be a triple zero
2600446 in a top fuel and alcohol car it is very hard to cut a light an average light would be a 080 light or a 070 light but in my alcohol car i was in the 020s and the 030s
2600447 so im trying to have the same reactions over here but the car is a little bit different and im not quite as good in a top fuel car as i was in an alcohol car but overall im average maybe a smidge better than that
2600448 i havent seen many drivers cut lights like him in top fuel
2600449 the top fuel car has all the same characteristics of the top alcohol dragster
2600450 it made it that much easier to get into a top fuel car and adapt to that car the top alcohol car is just like a top fuel dragster but without the supercharger
2600451 im racing against guys like bruce litton and terry mcmillen and its a big chore just to be at the top of the pack
2600452 we are more than halfway through the season and it would be a dream come true if we could make it all come together at the end

2600457 what this survey says is that graduates from lesser known universities may feel the need to alter their background to compete
2600458 the university has to be free to offer different contracts to academics and scientists
2600459 and within the university a lot of power needs to be devolved to the young people
2600460 its all about having decisions taken at the lowest level practicable
2600461 frances key bone of contention with the shanghai index is that the number of citations of a institutions scientific research is used as a ranking factor paris says this works against countries that do not publish in english
2600462 this chinese list seems less chauvinistically biased than the london times rankings i cited in tonights vdare article harvard 1 in both but stanford is 2 on the chinese list vs 19 on the english list behind a number of obscure provincial colleges in england because its a better list it supports the point i made in vdare even more strongly than the previous list did that americas exclusive universities are now enormously prestigious relative to germanys and the rest of the worlds german colleges that would have dominated the list 100 years ago have been hit hard by sincere leftist anti elitism
2600463 here was a university that had been through very difficult times it was the perfect opportunity to try out my theories
2600464 and they worked because the people at cardiff were ready for change and ready to change dramatically
2600465 because british universities have a great deal of autonomy and flexibility we were able to go out and recruit
2600466 he came to a department that was not strong but actually managed to increase its number of publications in top journals 11 fold

2600476 het complexe de chaos van brussel past wel bij mijn persoonlijkheid en bij mijn werk ik denk dat ik me op het platteland heel wat beter zou moeten organiseren daar kun je niet om drie uur in de ochtend nog vlug even buitenwippen om wc papier te kopen ik voel me dus goed in brussel maar toch ontsnap ik geregeld uitstapjes naar het bos naar zee om mijn batterijen weer op te laden ik heb dat echt wel nodig
2600477 het is heel raar ik voel me soms zon beetje het boerinnetje van brussel ik woon dan al wel heel mijn leven in een grootstad maar de wereld heb ik niet gezien of toch maar een heel klein stukje ervan
2600478 we woonden aan bockstael mama durfde ons tamelijk snel betrekkelijk veel vrijheid te geven ik ben haar daar dankbaar voor zo heb ik geleerd zelfstandig en sterk te zijn toen ik vijf was gingen we al zelf boodschappen doen en namen we al alleen het openbaar vervoer voor mij was de stad n grote ontdekkingsreis ik keek achter de schermen durfde zelfs op daken te kruipen om brussel echt te kunnen zien zo heb ik prachtige plekken ontdekt
2600479 door het werk van mama in pacheco aan de begijnhofkerk heb ik als kind opmerkelijke zaken gezien mama die er op de zwaarste afdeling van de instelling werkte nam me dikwijls mee een oude kvs acteur die helemaal seniel was geworden een suf geslagen bokser amper de veertig voorbij een gynaecoloog die dacht dat hij nog altijd gynaecoloog was en zijn praktijk trachtte verder te zetten bij de verpleegsters het gebeurde ook weleens dat wij op straat een bejaarde man of vrouw in pyjama of nachtjapon tegenkwamen pacheco dachten we dan waarop we samen dat oudje terugbrachten heel spannend maar tegelijkertijd was ik aangedaan omdat die mensen zo bang waren sommigen hadden zelfs nog nooit een bus of een auto gezien
2600480 ik ben al snel op mezelf gaan wonen bijna achttien was ik aan het hertogin van brabantplein in molenbeek waarom daar omdat de vader van een vriendin van op sint lukas waar ik schilderkunst studeerde er een huis had gekocht het was raar die zoektocht naar een eerste woonst merkwaardig de voorwaarden die eigenaars durven te stellen zo kreeg ik soms nul op het rekest omdat ik een meisje alleen was
2600481 in het begin ging ik dikwijls in mijn slaapkamer zitten omdat de ruimte me ontzag inboezemde
2600482 ik ben hier terechtgekomen via een vriendin de eigenaar woont boven mij los van het feit dat ik veel geluk heb gehad en dat nogal wat mensen klagen dat het bijna onmogelijk geworden is om in brussel een betaalbaar appartement te vinden blijf ik ervan overtuigd dat er echt wel mogelijkheden zijn ik heb altijd goedkoop gewoond op fantastische plekken mijn appartement op de arduinkaai naast de morgen zowat 120 vierkante meter bijna even groot als dit hier alleen met meer sleet op voor maar vijfhonderd euro in de maand het is echt wel te vinden hoor maar je moet je best doen
2600483 nadat ik was afgestudeerd in de schilderkunst heb ik hier en daar nog wat opleidingen en cursussen gevolgd onder meer aan de koksschool in anderlecht die ervaring breng ik nu al een aantal jaar in de praktijk door te koken op feestjes bij mensen thuis daarbij laat ik af en toe de artiest in mij meespreken zo heb ik eens een etentje voor 35 man verzorgd in een ardens kasteel elke genodigde had er zijn priv ober die heel de avond voor die man of vrouw moest zorgen
2600484 ik heb in mijn leven altijd verschillende richtingen uitgefladderd deels uit interesse deels uit angst geen baan te vinden ik heb affiches ontworpen voor vzws secretariaatswerk gedaan bij bronks als kok op een oud schip meegevaren gegidst in musea dansworkshops gegeven de vzw heb ik opgezet om een structuur te hebben waarin ik al die dingen kon samenbrengen ik dacht ik geef het drie jaar gaandeweg heb ik gemerkt dat er wel degelijk interesse is voor wat ik kwijt wil toch spookt nog steeds door mijn hoofd waar ben ik mee bezig vinden de mensen het wel interessant mijn projecten zijn ook niet evident ze lijken soms gek maar telkens als ik een positieve reactie krijg geeft dat een enorme boost ook vind ik het belangrijk om een breed publiek te bereiken mijn mama vindt het fantastisch wat ik doe haar steun betekent onvoorstelbaar veel voor mij
2600485 de meeste van mijn projecten spelen zich af in de openbare ruimte de stad maar ook het platteland het principe van van a naar b te gaan waarom mensen wandelaars zijn het blijft me fascineren walk 58 is een tram performance die ik in april heb opgezet samen met onder meer gerrit valckenaers op vraag van brussel behoort ons toe ze is gebaseerd op vrolijke anekdotes interviews over stad en expo nu vijftig jaar geleden over vooruitgang en verleden geen opsomming in de trant van we hebben zus en zo gezien we hebben dit en dat gedaan neen het was allemaal meer tussen de lijntjes er zit bijvoorbeeld een interview in van een kindje met een hardhorende oude vrouw c tait quoi lexpo 58 quelle dit zoiets zegt voor mij meer dan een opsomming van feiten de passagier van tram 81 naar de heizel kregen een mp3 speler met koptelefoon waarmee ze tijdens hun rit die fragmenten konden beluisteren terwijl een danser voor hun ogen speelde met het idee hoe gebruik je de tram heel leuk daaraan en aan de meeste andere van mijn projecten vind ik dat de toevallige passant publiek wordt
2600486 een van mijn absolute favorieten is how to survive in the city dat ik een paar jaar geleden heb geconcipieerd en dat nog altijd wordt gebracht op zoek gaan naar al wat eetbaar is op en tussen de straatstenen in samenwerking met een herboriste enkele wetenschappers en artiesten we gaan dan met een publiek de stad in tonen de plekken en vertellen verhalen we filmen dat ook je ziet op de achtergrond mensen zich haasten naar god weet waar en in die chaos zie je anderen geconcentreerd naar de grond kijken zich op een heel andere manier voortbewegend op zoek naar wormen sprinkhanen bloemen planten noem maar op ongelooflijk wat er allemaal te vinden is in de dansaertstraat hebben we tomatenplantjes ontdekt er staat een kiwiplant in de vlaamsesteenweg een vijgenboom aan het muntplein een ginkgo aan anneessens
2600487 ik ben toen met twee andere artiesten en vijf boerderijdieren een koe een ezel een hond een kip en een schaap door west vlaanderen gewandeld we wilden de vijf de zee laten zien en de relatie tussen mens en dier onderzoeken dat was de research achteraf hebben we er een theaterperformance van gemaakt die we in de beursschouwburg hebben opgevoerd drie dieren hebben de zee gehaald de hond de koe en de ezel onze familie en vrienden stonden ons op te wachten in de panne een emotioneel weerzien zo emotioneel dat we de dieren enkele minuten uit het oog verloren zijn maar geen nood ze stonden alle drie braafjes naar de zee te kijken mooi op een rijtje zo gek was het dus nog niet dat we al die tijd in de po zie van de onderneming hadden geloofd
2600488 nu ben ik bezig met de voorbereiding van salle des pas perdus een dansperformance op 6 september in de nieuwstraat op het munt en de brouck replein we gaan ook werken met de mensen die toevallig voorbijkomen werken rond grenzen vertrouwen de vraag waar kun je gaan waar niet en daarbij toevallige passanten betrekken ik ben vertrokken vanuit de vaststelling dat nogal wat hedendaagse dansers die voor de grote gezelschappen werken in de illegaliteit leven dat ze geen papieren hebben dat maakt dat ze zich in het dagelijks leven niet vrij kunnen bewegen zoals wij iets wat in schril contrast staat met hun werk en wij staan daar niet bij stil
2600489 ik heb niet alleen dansers gesproken maar ook heel veel andere mensen zonder papieren dat was een heel nieuwe wereld die voor mij openging terwijl die bijna naast mijn voordeur ligt ook dat is brussel achter elke hoek wacht een ander verhaal
2600490 dat gaat diep het is heel emotioneel en confronterend want wat is je taak als artiest maatschappelijk en politiek gezien salut en de kost dat is er bij mij niet bij zo heb ik ook nog steeds contact met de boeren bij wie we in west vlaanderen zijn blijven slapen die schrijven nog brieven die sturen nog fotos er zijn er zelfs een paar komen kijken naar de premi re in de beursschouwburg die hadden nog maar zelden hun erf verlaten het was fantastisch om die mensen in brussel te zien ik vroeg hun wat denk je van de stad heel veel clochards en heel veel lawaai kreeg ik als antwoord die boeren waren bezorgd om die clochards ze gingen boterhammen geven en centjes ik heb dat zelf ook een tijd gedaan elke clochard die ik tegenkwam vijf frank geven maar je kunt dat niet blijven doen op den duur ben je geru neerd ondertussen heb ik ook geleerd dat er opvang is voor die mensen dat er initiatieven zijn van de overheid en priv die zich daarmee bezighouden ik heb dat bij de mensen zonder papieren ook gezien er zijn echt wel advocaten en dokters die zich met hart en ziel voor hen inzetten er beweegt wat brussel is niet hopeloos verloederd maar de communicatie is niet altijd optimaal en daarmee beginnen veel problemen
2600491 mijn stamcaf zou ik het niet noemen als er een caf is dat daarvoor in aanmerking komt dan is het de daringman bij martine maar dan overdag ik ga minder en minder graag s avonds op caf als het niet onder vrienden is een vrouw alleen op caf wordt nu eenmaal anders bekeken dan een man alleen op caf alleen de straat op na het vallen van de avond ook al geen pretje tegen mensen die hier komen studeren of wonen en altijd maar zeggen het is hier vuil het is hier gevaarlijk het is hier dit het is hier dat ben ik heel mijn leven in gegaan maar op een bepaald moment heb ik moeten toegeven het is gewoon zo dat is een van de aspecten die brussel in mijn ogen een harde stad maakt
2600492 het is raar ik ken brussel heel goed en tegelijkertijd niet goed niet goed wat betreft straatnamen en de te volgen weg ik denk dat het ook te maken heeft met hoe je door de stad reist ik heb bijvoorbeeld geen auto zelfs geen rijbewijs als je veel het openbaar vervoer neemt beweeg je steeds langs dezelfde vaste lijnen h maar ik mis de auto niet al heb ik me voorgenomen op mijn veertigste ga ik voor mijn rijbewijs ik fantaseer dat ik tegen dan kinderen heb die heel trots zullen zijn dat mama dat doet en die me dan steunen
2600493 hoe het er in een andere stad echt toe gaat weet ik niet ik kan me dan ook niet goed voorstellen wat brussel zo uitzonderlijk maakt of juist zo tof of slecht brussel is voor mij een gewoonte je valt ook zo gemakkelijk in clich s als je het over de positieve en negatieve eigenschappen van brussel hebt elke medaille heeft zijn keerzijde en ik denk dat die van brussel welbekend zijn de anarchie de vrijheid om te gaan en staan waar je wilt de vele mogelijkheden die je hebt de vele netwerken die je kunt uitbouwen en tegelijkertijd is er bijvoorbeeld de vuiligheid ik heb hier zelfs in de buurt ooit eens een clochard zijn groot gevoeg zien doen op straat echt waar
2600494 ik loop hier al zo lang rond dat ik heel veel mensen ken maar het is me in veel gevallen niet meer duidelijk ken ik ze nu van zien of heb ik er echt mee gepraat waardoor ik soms onbeleefd overkom denk ik nog erger als ik bekende mensen zie en er lopen er hier nogal wat rond dan maak ik me ofwel belachelijk ofwel doe ik alsof ik ze niet gezien heb een anekdote ik kom iemand aan de beurs tegen van wie mijn beperkte kortetermijngeheugen zegt je kent die man en ik zeg goedendag hij zegt dag terug maar met een blik die zegt dat hij me niet kon plaatsen twee meter verder viel mijn frank dat was urbanus zulke stoten heb ik weleens vaker voor

2600525 much of your analysis is detailed and shrewd in fact whilst i have declined to comment in the past we have kept an eye on your blog and in some areas chosen to make improvements based on your observations
2600526 youll notice some slight differences to the survey this year mainly in that we have included a lot more universities as a result there are two questions about universities one asking about those around the world and a second asking about your own country specifically
2600527 we can do some more analysis on response dynamics and potentially more effectively counteract country biases

2600540 the canvassing of publications and citations seems to bring results which are so different using scopus instead of the thomson isi products of the last three years and the changes are in such way non uniform among institutions that it seems appropriate to consider the new version really a new ranking there will hardly be any comparability with the previous years

2600553 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking he is true professional and leader on and off the field and its a great deal for both brian and the eagles organization id like to give credit to joe banner todd france and brian for working so diligently in getting this deal done we look forward to brian having a great 2008 season and beyond
2600554 all of us wanted to get the deal done quickly but there was never a threat of what the would do if it wasnt
2600555 what hes done over the last few weeks with this going on and still working i mean he came out when he had strep throat and he practiced he just wants to win so badly and he wants the team to be the best it can be and thats whats always driven him
2600556 you take somebody with that kind of talent and those kind of intangibles that they bring to your team that is the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2600557 it would probably end up being three or four years
2600558 i think its the most complicated contract ive ever seen
2600559 i know i lost please let me suffer in silence
2600560 the most helpful method of dealing with stress is learning how to manage the stress that comes along with any new challenge good or bad
2600561 is this idea feasible what would i need to do to make this happen are their certain things that limit the possibility of this working
2600562 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2600563 im not expecting him to win but im expecting him to come out of here with a solid enough run where he can step back and say this is where i think your shortcoming is i think your cars need this your brake package this or maybe your engine or whatever
2600564 hes driven enough of these cars in testing and stuff that hopefully he can give some constructive feedback it doesnt have to be positive it just needs to be constructive
2600565 if somebody would have told me 10 years ago that some day you will drive for eddie wood and now richard petty i would have told them you are crazy
2600566 in my car its go all out and try to win it but when youre doing it for the wood brothers last year or the pettys youre points racing
2600567 i need to be smart and not take any unnecessary chances
2600568 i hope in the future nascar could tweak the rules where if they cancel qualifying and they know saturday might be better weather maybe they could lock the top 35 in but keep a half hour to go qualify the go or go homers
2600569 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2600570 when youre a new business and youre building your business you have to have a foundation and theyre part of our foundation
2600571 i think what it says more than anything is that the sponsorship works
2600572 to me its important for two reasons one just because the business has to have sponsorship to go forward two it says we sponsor mwr and it works for us were able to market our products through them so therefore were going to keep sponsoring them
2600573 it makes me want to be driving down the road and pull into a napa store and say thank you like ive done before it makes me want to do every tv show any interview anything i can do to help them because theyre giving us a chance
2600574 i like to look at it as they made our runway longer like were going down the runway and we feel like were getting ready to take off were doing a bunch of good things but if it ran out we would never get to show anybody theyve made our runway longer so were going to be able to continue to develop and grow our young team
2600575 napa just really means everything to us because theyre such a cornerstone
2600576 theyve been together with michael for a long time and what napa shows is theyre still believers theyre believers in what michael started theyre believers in nascar period theyre believers in sports marketing
2600577 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2600578 childress said i might run a couple of races i dont give a care whatever happens ive got a bunch of stuff i want to do it isnt any problem
2600579 there just comes a time when you dont have anything to drive
2600580 its not going to be its not going to be
2600581 thats just the way the sport is i dont have a problem with that i was there a long time and it isnt any biggie
2600582 hes going to make the transition really good he gives tremendous feedback and has a lot of talent he could go a long way
2600583 deb and i are out for good i wish you and the fort the best of luck
2600584 i think they found that trying to play a close hand role in ticonderoga from wyoming or a house in the south of france or on a yacht in the middle of the atlantic ocean was very very difficult
2600585 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2600586 says hes a democrat i dont know what his concept of democracy is but to me this is not democracy
2600587 president hugo chavez did not create the disqualifications against the opposition
2600588 one way or another these laws need to be approved
2600589 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before left hangzhou
2600590 we are now looking for tangs ex wife and elder brother hoping to find out what he did before the incident in beijing and figure out his motivation
2600591 this appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2600592 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2600593 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2600594 employability skills are those basic skills necessary for getting keeping and doing well on a job

2600597 foi mais uma jogada que o atacante deles chegou e o ju z acabou expulsando o nosso goleiro mas valeu o time lutou e no final eles conseguiram fazer o gol eu acho que n o reflete o que foi o jogo porque as duas equipes tiveram boas atua es

2600600 its not a business no one receives a salary and our work is supported by voluntary contributions
2600601 the splcs role is not to make demands of the fanjuls but they have put as a front woman on this very worthy philanthropic project a woman who represents everything that is antithetical to this project this is an untenable position she is not merely a woman who married white supremacist leaders she has actively participated in white supremacist functions
2600602 eu acho que foi falta do atacante deles que empurrou o william na jogada mas o rbitro entendeu de outra maneira ent o paci ncia
2600603 i was happy to vote for you and i will tell you that i am seriously considering voting for you in the general election i write to express my concerns that may in the end prevent me from supporting you
2600604 right wing ideologues who want to take away a womans right to choose
2600605 whatever your convictions if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women then you in my judgment are not fair minded i do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion only that you speak about this issue in fair minded words
2600606 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch

2600610 you can have her shipped home for 5 000 or you can bury her here in the holy land for 150
2600611 why would you spend 5 000 to ship your wife home when it would be wonderful to be buried here and you would spend only 150
2600612 long ago a man died here was buried here and three days later he rose from the dead i just cant take that chance

2600616 sugar cane which is used widely in brazil for ethanol production is grown in tropical regions and can drive deforestation
2600617 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
2600618 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties

2600622 japan should be proud of being a peace fostering nation and its commitment to multilateralism
2600623 the japanese people should know how much japans global role is appreciated in the united nations and worldwide

2600641 you love her and she loves you so what else matters
2600642 all music all blogs thanks allmusic all blogs hiya great blog your stuff is top class man i have added you to my extensive link list at
2600643 progressive blogosphere 2 0 posts the whole project appears to amount to nothing more than bitching about how the rest of the liberal blogs preferred obama so theyre going to start their own blogosphere with blackjack and hookers
2600644 our first gig as chili cold blood was me and doug playing guitar and a tambourine attached to a pedal that was our drum
2600645 i dont know if he really said that i think thats just what you heard
2600646 anyway its from that movie somewhere he said chili cold blood and that was it
2600647 as far as inspirations go i like rock and roll the rolling stones r l burnside these guys and i all collectively love black sabbath music that we all grew up listening to at any point in your life youre into something different and that stays with you its kind of a free for all weve always had a vision of what we wanted to do and we set those boundaries but those boundaries are pretty broad
2600648 we still have a strong background these guys have a big blues background it still has the black sabbath behind it theyre pulling from a bluesy rootsy type background but im not really going to be playing the traditional drum beats to go along with it
2600649 in the beginning we wanted to make a band like black sabbath and r l burnside it evolved and now we just consider ourselves a rock band listening to the last record afterwards we kind of realized that we had stuff in there we didnt even realize we had in us for instance the beastie boys really came out on that record primus too
2600650 weve gotten even more into country in the past year but at the same time every year that passes you can see more and more of what rock and metal albums stand the test of time nows a really interesting time in music theres not a whole lot thats new thats happening right now thats happening in music that ive heard but i think what is happening is there are people who are taking from the past what a lot of people havent really picked up on before i think thats our mission right now theres some really fucked up weird psychedelic country out there from the 70s and stuff that no one really knows about
2600651 weve finally gotten to a place were comfortable enough that were not concerned with what genre were in were just making music that we like we can cross lines pretty easily
2600652 people have a stigma against southern rock these days but when it boils down to it i guess thats what we are
2600653 we figured out a way we wanted to put out our own records we didnt want to listen to somebody else tell us what they thought we should do basically we figured out a way to make records very cheaply after being able to that for ourselves we said well wouldnt it be cool to get other bands that were really good that werent signed that we could help put out records for so we just decided to it and it was really rewarding to put out records for other bands that we really liked
2600654 the new merge will actually give resurgence to the old school bluesy sounds of chili cold blood keeping in tow the more rockin outlaw country ala rolling stones side of the moonhangers while introducing a new dark southern hybrid blood country is the new southern rock the new texas roadhouse its where southern music culminates where a fella throws back some whiskey with an outlaw babe hangin on a beltloop while the jukebox vibrates the walls with loud rippin guitars and songs about money lost land taken and love drained
2600655 cu ndo se te quitar esa maldita costumbre de no recargarlo a tiempo
2600656 its scarcely clear yet how things will stand between the two when the smoke clears
2600657 it will send a message to everyone that this path doesnt work
2600658 that the crocodile is hungry well from the point of view of someone who wants to keep his own leg thats hard to accept
2600659 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2600660 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders
2600661 the eu and nato must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe
2600662 the russian federation has overstepped a red line in keeping the peace and stability in the conflict zone and in protecting russian citizens outside its own borders
2600663 marshall goldman a leading russia scholar argues in a recent book that mr putin has established a petrostate in which oil and gas are strategically deployed as punishments rewards and threats the author details the lengths to which mr putin has gone to retain control over the delivery of natural gas from central asia to the west a proposed alternative pipeline would skirt russia and run through georgia as an oil pipeline now does if georgia collapses in turmoil mr goldman notes investors will not put up the money for a bypass pipeline and so he concludes mr putin has done his best to destabilize the saakashvili regime
2600664 at a morning town hall meeting in lima mccain was dogged by democratic complaints that his campaign manager rick davis was a highly paid lobbyist for german owned dhl who lobbied congress to accept a dhl proposal to buy airborne express airborne ran its operations out of the wilmington air park in clinton county and now dhl now proposes to leave wilmington
2600665 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2600666 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2600667 offshore drilling will only supply approximately 6 months of us oil consumption at current levels so its a bad idea when compared with very real energy alternatives like wind and solar
2600668 you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday youll join us and the world will live as one
2600669 and thats not all mccains campaign manager was the top lobbyist for the dhl deal helped push it through his firm was paid 185 000 to lobby mccain and other senators now 8 200 ohioans are facing layoffs and foreign owned dhl doesnt care john mccain same old politics same failed policies
2600670 that is because mccains policys are written by his lobbyists mccains job is to try to make these policys seem like they are good for america when really they are just good for his lobbyists there is a radical idea with no proof any evidence of what you speak
2600671 that is because mccains policys are written by his lobbyists mccains job is to try to make these policys seem like they are good for america when really they are just good for his lobbyists
2600672 that is because mccains policys are written by his lobbyists
2600673 i notice nobody could name a mccain policy that went against the clients of the paid lobbyists on his campaign payroll
2600674 bigger issue at hand is what is russia up to that country they invaded next doot to afghanistan maybe russia wants to take back afghanistan and fund terrorist to strike america again pay back is a bltch we did it to them during the clinton era
2600675 stop being idealistic and get real this is how politicians get elected hell take from individuals but doesnt care at about citiznes b c they have no power it is has always been this way time to stop being naive about obama
2600676 obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family

2600682 worship is to quicken the conscience by the holiness of god
2600683 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2600684 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2600685 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess

2600688 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2600689 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2600690 hes the first one to really admit guilt so far as to be where theyre at
2600691 it started with his wife im glad he wont be wasting our money taxpayer money

2600693 you dont forget it sadly a lot of people got hurt
2600694 we didnt expect that many we only had enough for 12
2600695 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us

2600703 this type of behaviour is a crucial part of emo ideology
2600704 of course there are emo teens who just listen to their music but our actions are not directed at them but rather at those who also hurt themselves commit suicide and promote those acts
2600705 suicide is not a symptom of emo culture i work with other teens too and every group has emotionally troubled kids
2600706 blossom smile some sunshine down my way lately ive been lonesome
2600707 oh that guy from that hit show in the 70s is dead that sucks

2600709 a memorandum of understanding was reached between syria and the iaea that stipulated a visit exclusively to the kibar site and for one time only
2600710 syria has honoured this and affirmed that if the agency had any queries after the visit it could present them to the syrian side to answer
2600711 syria did not work on setting up a nuclear reactor with the korean democratic republic or any other country
2600712 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2600713 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2600714 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2600715 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2600716 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2600717 ground game as a rapidly progressing professional in the mixed
2600718 hes got quite a few contacts in the hutt valley area and its still possible that he may well be with one of them but thats a little bit uncertain
2600719 obviously as time goes on the more concern there is
2600720 what we have here is a good samaritan who is doing no harm to anyone and shes confronted by the full force of the law
2600721 its terrible weve been warning the police about this for some time now and nothing has been done
2600722 weve got a system in place that is trusting people to do the right thing
2600723 this is the only country in the world as far as we know where youre allowed to do this its bloody disgusting
2600724 we have a fantastic relationship with police arms officers they are aware of how stringent we are
2600725 this study demonstrates simply and elegantly that advertising literally brainwashes young children into a baseless preference for certain food products

2600727 the best part of all of training with noel has been changing my vision of training from standalone exercises to using whole body exercises i have completely re learnt how to work out different parts of my body using new techniques i was particularly wary of the fitness ball and i have been converted so drastically that im buying my own the sessions were great because they were tailored to my needs and aims throughout this was exactly what i wanted because my aims let alone my fitness level has changed throughout the months i have felt and seen the improvement the information and support i have obtained has made me feel like i can continue training on my own in a more knowledgeable way

2600730 finally i feel graceful my strides are fluid when i catch a glimpse of myself in a store window i see a confident woman not someone who looks like she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders
2600731 sitting at the computer all day used to leave me feeling drained after work im now taking a course in spanish instead of dragging myself home and collapsing on the sofa

2600733 any procrastinator worth his secret stash of chocolate bars can come up with a dozen reasons to skip going to work out but when the trainer is knocking on your front door youre down to two options either let him in or hide under the dining room table and pretend youre not home in short in home pt works

2600748 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

2600750 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
2600751 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
2600752 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
2600753 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a mighty rushing wind that filled the house where they were assembled suddenly cloven tongues like fire appeared and settled upon each of them and they were filled with the holy spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
2600754 this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel

2600760 this year they got 150 police at the harbor for the fireworks
2600761 get back on that horse and ride or ill tear your throat out
2600762 the event is an opportunity for the young impressionable people of today to see some of the mature individuals who produced this effort that won us all these things that we have today
2600763 the spirit of those soldiers is still the spirit that was imbued in those first test platoon troopers back in 1940
2600764 i think its one of the best times of the year
2600765 i anticipate it you get into the summer and youre waiting for it
2600766 20 years after i first testified before congress on the threats posed by climate change we have reached a point at which we must remove unnecessary carbon emissions from our lives or face catastrophic consequences it is hard to imagine waste more unnecessary than the 100 billion pieces of junk mail americans receive each year and these new findings revealing that the emissions of junk mail are equal to those of over nine million cars underscore the prudent necessity of a do not mail registry
2600767 we are now seeing floods and landslides closing road and railways
2600768 this is just the kind of impact we will expect to see more of as the climate changes further
2600769 scotland has the potential to produce the best climate change legislation anywhere in the world setting the benchmark for the climate talks over the next 18 months
2600770 the snp have promised a lot but the detailed legislation will need to include all of the climate change gases and emissions from international aviation and shipping if it is to capture all of scotlands direct impact
2600771 that one might argue that they constitute little more than outdoor zoo populations
2600772 cannot be expected to expend funds indefinitely to maintain condors in nature
2600773 progress toward recovery is not sustainable under current conditions because reintroduction of more condors simply increases the costs required to keep wild birds alive
2600774 an extensive outreach effort to rally support for replacement of lead ammunition
2600775 poisoning from ingestion of spent ammunition in carcasses is so severe and chronic
2600776 that condor recovery cannot be achieved so long as such lead exposure continues
2600777 removing lead ammunition is not only right for condors it is right for other scavengers and it is right for hunters and their families
2600778 may be highly problematic california fish and game has done little to educate hunters and non lead ammunition is not readily available or identifiable in many retail outlets
2600779 unlikely to comply as long as lead bullets are easily purchased
2600780 it all started in a private jet between nelson skalbania and peter pocklington and it was a backgammon game with pretty high stakes as it turns out
2600781 peter won that game and there was a wager made some money exchanged hands and wayne gretzky eddie mio and peter driscoll ended up in edmonton oilers uniforms
2600782 yes they were part of the stakes of this backgammon game there were some trades mentioned actually we had our choice on the third player between peter driscoll and blaine stoughton and we took peter driscoll
2600783 it was a cornerstone for edmonton to build on later that year 1979 after the nhl expansion to edmonton hartford quebec and winnipeg the four wha cities we took mark messier who had been in cincinnati in the wha in the nhl draft it really gave edmonton a nucleus to go on and be very competitive in the national hockey league
2600784 i saw it in progress and i knew the stakes were very high and i was cheering like heck for peter
2600785 i think there was some art involved from peters side and from nelsons side it happened to be hockey players it was kind of a strange transaction in the world of sports i didnt care if peter lost and lost his artwork i was more interested that he won and get some hockey players to build our foundation with yes he kept his artwork ended up with some hockey players and paid out some cash in the transaction
2600786 scouts obviously felt he could be a tremendous player i dont know if anyone in their right mind at that time thought he could be the dominating force he has been to the game of hockey in the long run especially wayne ended up in los angeles it was good for the game of hockey

2600797 unlike some previous studies we were able to control for the effects of known risk factors notably poverty and migration from high incidence countries
2600798 linking to census data also allowed us to include a relatively large number of cases
2600799 the finding that tb rates are associated with crowded living conditions fits with what we know about the transmission of this bacteria via small airborne droplets

2600816 as dijkstra says program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence

2600900 do you know i believe its a perfect match for your eyes yes the color is nearly identical this will look fantastic on you
2600901 a gift for someone special no doubt though its difficult to believe that two people could be fortunate enough to have such brilliant blue eyes
2600902 oh no sir were at the wrong counter these are all mens rings the womens rings are over in that counter
2600903 lets see here lapis lapis mans ring ah yes here it is the mens lapis lazuli magic fit
2600904 not everyone knows their loved ones that is to say the recipients ring size with magic fit the ring will fit itself perfectly to the wearer

2600907 as im sure you know valentines day is fast approaching which means that there will be all sorts of hogwarts students looking to buy something special for their sweethearts and friends
2600908 if you would be willing to tell your fellow students where you purchased this ring i could see my way clear to offering you a discount of say eight galleons
2600909 yes i see i imagine that could be a problem
2600910 we havent exhausted all possibilities besides i would truly like to be able to help you
2600911 because i can tell that this is very important to you
2600912 you were clearly uncomfortable coming in here but you put that aside to obtain a special gift for someone who must be truly remarkable and if i may say very lucky to have such a friend
2600913 then let me suggest another plan your friend neednt tell anybody that you bought the ring for him which goes without saying all he has to do is let his fellow students know where it was purchased would that work
2600914 but if i have to i can return it right
2600915 not certain that the gift will be received in the spirit in which its given
2600916 of course i will happily refund your money should the outcome be less than satisfactory your friend has blue eyes like yours yes
2600917 not his eyes but yours well i dont know how he would be able to look at this ring and not think of your striking blue eyes lapis lazuli it is then
2600918 i really do appreciate this and ill tell anybody who asks that this is the only place to go for jewelry
2600919 and thank you for reminding me what it feels like to be young
2600920 well lets just say that youve reminded me that we all have a first time and that it can be at once terrifying and exhilarating

2600928 youre a bloke maybe you noticed i didnt say it either
2600929 just something someone said to me once about first times
2600930 we all have them and they can be brilliant but they can be scary too
2600931 i have the feeling were going to have a load of first times in the near future

2600970 in 1977 the charts were being compiled by the british market research bureau bmrb
2600971 the easiest way to change the results would have been to be choosy in the selection of which diaries to include out of the 700 available allowing for some that wouldnt turn in in ealing on time to make up the 250 diaries used to compile the charts
2600972 the outcome was that by skewing the sample of diaries used in favour of general retailers against specialist retailers a less controversial record retained the number 1 slot over a record that would possibly throw the record industry into a bad light
2600973 did it happen well its very feasible and a number of sources who were in the industry at that time have confirmed that the record companies were concerned about the situation and even spoke to bmrb but would bmrb have changed the diary selection i dont know and i suspect well never know
2600974 all right supposing we have established that this new found freedom is not in fact the freedom to perform before an audience a freedom which im sure you will agree was never denied
2600975 of course the corollary is that audiences have the freedom not to listen but thats a whole other point this freedom is the freedom to have a recording contract then and to be broadcast on mainstream radio so that one can get in the charts and thus to be famous an icon or am i missing the point again

2600984 oh i know how this story goes i meet the mysterious stranger in a bar she acts suitably cryptic enough to peak my interest just before she disappears into the night i cant get her out of my head and go on an exhaustive quest until i finally find her again at which point we make mad passionate love and i discover the meaning of my existence right
2600985 yes you left out the part of the story where i dont want to sleep with you and the part where disappearing into the night would mean waiting here for another three hours
2600986 so youre looking for the meaning of your existence huh
2600987 you wouldnt have said it if you werent feeling sardonic enough to want it to happen
2600988 youre one of those people who thinks she knows everything arent you

2601010 if youd worked out that im a wizard and that i was running away from another wizard why would you take me to a wizarding village this is exactly the kind of place i was trying to avoid
2601011 thanks by the way for bringing me here or at least away from where we were
2601012 ratana she was my twin but she was older by fifteen minutes
2601013 well youre welcome to stay with me im sure my roommate wont mind
2601014 how do you know im not going to murder you in the night
2601015 so how come you didnt just take me home with you in the first place
2601016 hmph im starting to think that dragon out there has something to do with you suddenly trusting me enough to take me home to meet the missus
2601017 right sorry i forgot you modern women like to mix it up
2601018 why does everyone keep looking at me like ive died or something

2601027 nearly a week of living together and the first thing you ask me is wheres my ear gone
2601028 youre pretty ungrateful for a man who just had dinner made for him
2601029 i dont mean to sound ungrateful thank you for this you didnt have to
2601030 yes you know novelties pranks of varying destructiveness that sort of thing
2601031 er well we have these throw pillows actually goose pillows
2601032 no i mean goose pillows see they look normal but they tickle you when you lean back on them and better yet they grab your arse when you sit on them hence the name you see
2601033 someone might want to use them to surprise their unsuspecting friends
2601034 never mind yes they are technically pranks but the charm can be disabled so you can use them as normal throw pillows so yes we do sell things that arent as you so lovingly put it juvenile

2601071 this isnt a joke this is your life and you know its pointless bullshit youre not going to find any kind of peace out here that you wouldnt eventually find at home
2601072 fred would kick your arse for pulling this kind of stunt now you know that
2601073 dont what say his name he was my brother too george
2601074 you dont think i know exactly what fred would do every second of every fucking day you dont think ive been thinking about what fred would do in this situation what hed say how hes say it
2601075 you honestly dont think that i see his face every fucking day every fucking night inside my head in every fucking reflective surface
2601076 can you honestly stand there and tell me you know what fred wouldve done better than i do can you honestly fucking stand there and look at my face and tell me that i dont know him enough to know what hed do
2601077 you dont get it thats what i was looking for no funeral no family looking at me like they think they know like our pain is the same
2601078 you have to start feeling something sometime itll only catch up to you in the end
2601079 im begging here george come home we need you back you just have to let yourself feel it yeah
2601080 youre lucky i dont punch you on the nose wanker
2601081 i know charlies been following you all this time mustve caught up with you and threatened you with bodily harm if you didnt haul arse and get back here
2601082 no well yes actually he basically did do that but thats not why im here
2601083 amongst the various insults he said something that made me stop and think
2601084 before i tell you what he said let me ask you something about your letters
2601085 you were just trying to lure me back here with vague promises of hot sex right you were just appealing to my perverted side werent you i mean that wasnt well what was that exactly
2601086 i told you george i missed you thats all and the shop needs you of course
2601087 that ive got a good man here who loves me he said thats one of the things that will help me get through all this
2601088 yeah well no he didnt say here specifically but the other things he mentioned were things that are here so i assume the guy is too
2601089 well of course i love you george youre my best mate
2601090 you were already in the most important relationship you were ever going to have
2601091 he was the most important person in your life george
2601092 oh dont get defensive im not suggesting there was anything incesty going on
2601093 no but you should certainly be the very last person to ever do so
2601094 yeah well there wasnt room for anyone else in your life not really and now i feel like right git for saying that because he was your twin of course he was the most important person in the world to you and he was my best mate i felt like i was being selfish so i never said anything
2601095 you shouldnt have felt that way i think i think he wants us to be together i think he did when he was alive too
2601096 and what am i saying whos to say i was ready for a relationship anyway
2601097 weve been given another chance so maybe we shouldnt waste it
2601098 this isnt some kind of weird fetish for you now is it
2601099 no no no dont be silly its not weird well yeah its a little odd but are you going to explain to me why you want me to touch it
2601100 well isnt it convenient to be able to tell yourself that someone you loved who died isnt really gone but is just somewhere else waiting for you i mean it seems more like a nice little explanation to help the living cope with the idea of death rather than something that actually happens
2601101 maybe but well wheres the harm in it i mean if it helps people and isnt hurting anyone you know and what about ghosts theyre proof of an afterlife arent they
2601102 sort of i guess but not everyone becomes a ghost some of them just cease to exists
2601103 ghosts are just dead people who have unfinished business what happens once their business is finished
2601104 you looked at me funny when i said fred spoke to me in my dreams
2601105 i didnt mean to imply that that couldnt possibly happen i just i just
2601106 its not crazy its nice of course hed come to see you
2601107 he said fred said that you made me make noises i dont make with anyone else
2601108 yes he said it sounded like you were murdering me
2601109 you know youre the only one who can touch me there now
2601110 back cant shag up here in front of the window can we
2601111 i can tell i can see it in your eyes
2601112 doesnt count if you say it when youre about to toss your load mate
2601113 that rule only applies if oh fucking hell if my dick is inside you
2601114 george cried out body arching and writhing out of control as he spilled his seed onto his belly pushing roughly up against lee
2601115 i think we need to locate ourselves a proper bed for the night
2601116 verity said shed quit if she came in here and found me naked one more time
2601117 hey thats the kind of thing that happens when youre gone too long
2601118 you filthy bugger oh hey tell lee his missing ear fetish joke was killer
2601119 you know my nervousness back at the shop when we were about to
2601120 lots of things i guess the wars over and everythings different and its complicated i guess but the thing is its weird but i wasnt nervous with other people ive been with recently
2601121 thats good to know but youve never been nervous with me before
2601122 because we finally found the bollocks to tell each other how we feel
2601123 well this has been nice but your mother is going to be beating down our door in about 20 minutes tops and i would like to be clothed for your horrid death at the hands of your loving family
2601124 oh i would hope theyd be decent enough not to murder me in front of my friends
2601125 not just yet though just a few more minutes yeah
2601126 no well yes he kept interrupting us dont get your hopes up it wasnt a threesome situation
2601127 i am now fully convinced that fred is visiting you in your dreams because interrupting us during sex is definitely something hed do has done on purpose repeatedly
2601128 good point he said to tell you good job on the missing ear fetish joke last night
2601129 seedy motels and no star hotels still i had to learn
2601130 but honey youre my last hope and who else can i turn to
2601131 the indiana wind and rain cut through me im lost and alone chilled to the bone
2601132 put em away luv i can see how that could work

2601137 do not despise the snake for not having horns for who knows it may become a dlagon
2601138 do not despise the snake for having no horns for who is to say that it will not become a dragon
2601139 the year long prelude to the beijing games has seen a major crackdown on free speech and dissent a massive sweep of undesirables from the host city and increasing abuses of ethnic minority tibetans and uighurs
2601140 i would put china in the top 10 percent of all the authoritarian states in the world
2601141 every country in the world oil states excepted with gdppc topping 8 000 was at least partly free as categorized by the human rights group freedom house indeed all ranked as free except the tiny island city state of singapore
2601142 classed as belonging to the free nations of the earth
2601143 ladies and gentleman the winners of this years eurovision song contest are
2601144 well i think we can all see that that is not true
2601145 i would comb every home every neighbourhood bar i would ride every greyhound or railroad car

2601150 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2601151 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2601152 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2601153 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2601154 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2601155 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2601156 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2601157 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2601158 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2601159 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2601160 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2601161 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2601162 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2601163 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2601164 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2601165 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2601166 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2601167 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2601168 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2601169 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2601170 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2601171 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2601172 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2601173 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2601174 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2601175 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2601176 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2601177 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2601178 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2601179 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2601180 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2601181 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2601182 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2601183 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2601184 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2601185 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2601186 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2601187 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2601188 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2601189 este post foi escrito em 13 07 2008 s 3 36 pm
2601190 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2601191 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2601192 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2601193 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2601194 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2601195 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2601196 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2601197 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2601198 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2601199 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2601200 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2601201 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2601202 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2601203 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2601204 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2601205 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2601206 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2601207 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2601208 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2601209 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2601210 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2601211 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2601212 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2601213 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2601214 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2601215 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of ossetian capital tskhinvali
2601216 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2601217 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2601218 we want to be free and we want to be a multi ethnic democracy
2601219 russia has bombed the black sea port of poti and the military base at senaki we think russia has started to bomb civil and economic infrastructure
2601220 there are bodies of women old people and children lying in the streets
2601221 make no mistake about it this is already war a very real painful war
2601222 i have lived there throughout all the previous conflicts including the war in the early 1990s and they were always fought by soldiers against other soldiers
2601223 now the difference is that its the civilian population thats taking the brunt of the aggression
2601224 i saw bodies on the streets in cars its impossible to count them there is hardly a single building undamaged
2601225 your love sets me free i feel high never knew i had it in me with you by my side i can breathe
2601226 vimos o impacto dos ataques a reos em gori edif cios em chamas pod amos ouvir a avia o russa sobre n s em um dos ataques o piloto errou a base militar alvejada e atingiu dois blocos de apartamentos civis
2601227 but now of days its a million duck and cover drills a thousand alarms a steady drumbeat of things to fear
2601228 of course the entertainment industry isnt increasing the cognitive complexity of its products for charitable reasons the sleeper curve exists because theres money to be made by making culture smarter
2601229 but now of days its a million duck and cover drills a thousand alarms a steady drumbeat of things to fear
2601230 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2601231 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2601232 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2601233 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2601234 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2601235 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2601236 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2601237 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2601238 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2601239 who are open to doing something on the production side
2601240 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2601241 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2601242 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2601243 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2601244 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2601245 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2601246 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2601247 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2601248 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2601249 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2601250 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2601251 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2601252 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2601253 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2601254 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2601255 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2601256 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2601257 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2601258 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2601259 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2601260 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2601261 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2601262 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2601263 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2601264 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2601265 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2601266 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2601267 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2601268 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2601269 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2601270 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2601271 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2601272 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2601273 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2601274 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2601275 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2601276 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2601277 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2601278 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2601279 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2601280 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2601281 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2601282 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2601283 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2601284 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2601285 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2601286 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2601287 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2601288 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2601289 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2601290 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2601291 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2601292 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2601293 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2601294 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2601295 listen to them the children of the night what sweet music they make
2601296 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2601297 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2601298 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2601299 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2601300 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2601301 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2601302 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2601303 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2601304 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2601305 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2601306 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2601307 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2601308 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2601309 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2601310 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2601311 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2601312 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2601313 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2601314 you see their loving gaze its this small love story
2601315 so i began thinking isnt there some way to make that kind of a parallel story
2601316 hes a baby hes brand new hes confused disoriented and irritable and hes been down there in the water for thousands and thousands of years
2601317 there are a bunch of smaller things humans that are annoying him and shooting at him like a swarm of bees
2601318 none of these things are going to kill the monster but they hurt it and it doesnt understand
2601319 so much has been done in so many different movies with large creatures that the trick was to find a way to create a unique character
2601320 one of the things that struck me about nevilles instructional videos was the way he approaches everything from a realistic point of view he develops non existing creatures but can explain to you their physical makeup musculature and skeletal structure
2601321 neville was the first person we met with and hes amazing he doesnt just think about designing the creature he thinks in terms of how it would walk how it would breathe what its skin would be like how it lives everything
2601322 we did a test where we inserted him into some background plate shot in downtown another facet of the design was added at director reeves suggestion
2601323 i wanted him to have that sort of spooked feeling the way when a horse is spooked you can see the white of its eyes along the bottom and you see that when the military is firing on him where he becomes completely agitated and confused
2601324 drew and i were struggling with when you have a monster that size how do you keep the characters from seeming totally irrelevant
2601325 because hes so big we knew it was going to be difficult to have intimate sequences its not like any of the characters could fight him or that anyone could even figure out a way to hurt him
2601326 theyre these horrifying dog sized creatures that just scatter around the city and add to the nightmare of the evening
2601327 they have the viciousness of a dog but with the ability to climb walls and stick to things
2601328 irish coach charlie weis is tougher than i am that i can tell you so its easier playing for an easy going guy like me
2601329 obviously playing in front of 80 000 people at notre dame pays big dividends it doesnt faze him when he comes here
2601330 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground
2601331 liberal activist group to intimidate supporters of republican and conservative causes
2601332 two or more persons conspire to prevent by force intimidation or threat any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for president or vice president or as a member of congress of the united states or to injure any citizen in person or property on account of such support or advocacy
2601333 ok no cameras no stealing signs you questioned our 3 championships were gonna kick everybodys ass up and down the field and dont care who we upset because you cant do anything about it
2601334 we told you so we told you so we were disrespected and everyone thought we were cheaters
2601335 is it because hes knocking out these interviews before he gets dressed
2601336 is he already dressed and thats what hes wearing to go home
2601337 why is sean taylor dead i heard on tv or the radio that he made somebody mad and they did this to him
2601338 if i were in a foxhole with anyone itd be that guy
2601339 well regroup and win the big ten and play in the rose bowl that was our goal this year
2601340 yeah man thats an atlantic conference team our conference is tough if we cant win it somebody from our conference can
2601341 out of the hunt and could kiss their championship dreams goodbye
2601342 these guys dont really care about finals most of them arent there for the education
2601343 wow that jessica simpson and tony romo sure make a great couple i think those crazy kids are gonna make it
2601344 new heroes who make an appearance and captivate our interest but they arent strong enough to attach a whole plot line to which seems crazy since there are about 756 of them going right now or they get killed off partway through the season
2601345 34 carries 321 yards 2 tds 1 rush 1 pass now shut up
2601346 it doesnt matter jfk should be running this year anyway
2601347 you sat in those players homes and told their parents youd take care of their kids how can these guys up and leave like that
2601348 dont call me when youre in my neighborhood call me when youre on my block
2601349 forget this im sitting out this season if this is what 350 carries a season does to you
2601350 hey were starting a football team what are you up to
2601351 internet music class so easy a caveman can do it
2601352 spring ahead fall back buy kentucky and auburn pom poms
2601353 you write that tech fans remember glennon from the lsu and clemson thrashings glennon never saw the field vs clemson and you could label both games as thrashings but one against tech and one for tech
2601354 how could you leave your wife for one of her enemies
2601355 old man bowden has lost his touch with the administration and ncaa delaware blue hens 17 at bucknell bison
2601356 thats what im talkin about put a heisman on them hoes
2601357 stand all game scream your head off on third down never leave early
2601358 coach were you nervous as the clock ticked down and you went for that shot in the end zone what was your thinking there
2601359 well we had matt put it where only our guy could get it and if he didnt we had time to get another play off you know we had about 16 18 seconds left

2601385 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2601386 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2601387 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2601388 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2601389 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2601390 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2601391 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2601392 this is a lot of money for a property that the district could have purchased years ago and the run up in price is based on the developer speculating that if the district didnt buy it he could put a huge development on it and make double his investment

2601394 you are mourning for me and repenting and sitting by an empty tomb
2601395 when he reached the tomb he found that the stones had been moved and the entrance was open he was astonished at the sight and overcome by fear local people heard the rumors but no one dared go inside the parallels here with john 20 4 6 are patent and obvious
2601396 it seemed incredible that even the corpse was not lying there then chaeras himself though he hunted through the tomb he could find nothing many people could not believe it and were seized by helplessness one of them said
2601397 the tomb robbers have done that but what about the corpse where is it
2601398 he offered up prayer sand supplications to him who was able to save him from death and he was heard for his godly fear and though he was a son he learned obedience

2601463 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free

2601491 the foundation is bionomics biology cancer vasculature and ion channel the drugs in development are the walls and the roof is our multicore chemistry the way we go about our chemistry

2601493 bionomics has a broad range of compounds that are highly selective orally active and suppression the symptoms of multiple sclerosis in animal models
2601494 merck serono can select an undisclosed number of compounds and for each one we get us47 million in milestone payments
2601495 we know whats happening in the phase i trial were encouraged by the enthusiasm of the clinicians in the trial
2601496 getting 105 established in its phase ii program is going to be a very important milestone next year along with cementing the relationship with merck serono and getting our anxiety compound into the clinic next year

2601507 we like to play songs that speak to the soldiers as well
2601508 it is an incredible investment that the band brings every week to the soldiers
2601509 these soldiers come off mission work hard to learn songs and prepare for the weekly worship services
2601510 the band adds so much to the service just having live music enhances our ability to praise god
2601511 it is some great downtime coming off mission and then coming here to practice our songs
2601512 the band is a sense of peace in such a hectic time

2601524 there is no public demand for english regional assemblies with legislative powers whether under a federal system or otherwise
2601525 i can well understand that where we are at the present time is far from satisfactory for people from england perhaps less from a northern ireland point of view and more from scotland point of view
2601526 the answer is not in english only votes and i think that a lot more thought has to go into it or else we will damage the union and i dont think that is either what the conservative party or the democratic unionists want to see
2601527 at least it is clear that david cameron is thinking about the issue and i think some others need to start thinking about it the debate is on and hes made an opening contribution to it and it is out there to be discussed i dont think we have arrived at a conclusion to that debate but the issue does need to be addressed lets work on it until we find a resolution

2601533 the most valuable medal for us which we want is the medal of peace
2601534 our flag has been hoisted at the olympic village and this lifts our hearts because we are at a place where peace cooperation friendship and solidarity among people lauds and solidarity is what cyprus needs

2601553 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2601554 i wish there were a more painless way to pick a bottom but the only way to get ahead of the curve is to take a little damage at the bottom we need to be very realistic about what happens next week and fall back to a more conservative strategy if we break below 11 000 but im really hoping something comes out by pre market monday to let us put the gse issue behind us so we can get back to focusing on a very busy earnings week

2601568 when you consider that a portion of this country particularly in midwestern and rust belt states still wrongly believe that obama may be a muslim and they equate that with terrorist activity its puzzling
2601569 someone needs to explain satire to the senator and inform him that the cover might actually do him more political good than harm obama and his campaign are far too sensitive
2601570 the best thing he could have done was laughed pointed out that this country is based on free speech even if he doesnt agree with whats being said and moved on the overreaction is giving legs to something that should not have them

2601600 kami mengingatkan agar majlis peguam jangan cuba bermain dengan api isu hal ehwal islam adalah isu sangat sensitif kepada umat islam
2601601 tindakan ini jelas cuba menghidupkan semula usaha terdahulu yang dilakukan oleh beberapa kelompok dari majlis peguam bagi menubuhkan ifc dan kemudian diikuti pula oleh satu lagi usaha dari kumpulan yang menggelarkan dirinya sebagai kumpulan artikel 11
2601602 kami menegaskan bahawa majlis peguam tidak ada hak untuk memandai mandai dan cuba membahaskan hal yang berkaitan dengan undang undang islam secara terbuka
2601603 kami mendesak supaya forum ini dihentikan oleh pihak berkuasa kerana ia boleh membawa kepada kemarahan masyarakat islam yang tidak mahu undang undang islam dicabar oleh mana mana pihak
2601604 tindakan berkenaan adalah suatu usaha yang terancang yang disusun oleh pihak tertentu untuk secara berterusan mempertikaikan hak hak yang terkandung dalam perlembagaan terhadap islam
2601605 kami memberi amaran kepada majlis peguam agar menghentikan segera penganjuran forum berkenaan atau menghadapi tindakan penentangan serius umat islam di negara ini
2601606 justeru kami mahu perbincangan terbuka persoalan yang sensitif ini dihentikan segera

2601609 the surge has succeeded yet commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2601610 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2601611 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2601612 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines

2601654 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2601655 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2601656 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large

2601680 no legal authority to investigate the circumstances of your complaint
2601681 does he have the authority over any locally elected city or county official

2601690 youtube is an amazing video sharing site its great to get everyone together
2601691 its all about the experience meeting together and really understanding the celebration of the virtual world
2601692 the whole interesting thing about the youtube community is its all about connecting to others
2601693 youtube has its own culture its own celebrities its own politics
2601694 the youtube stars are kind of like the new tv stars
2601695 there might be youtube celebrities here but its also the ones that arent that well known the ones that you make friends with online they are the ones who make me really happy to meet in person
2601696 the general s report on iraq required the willing suspension of disbelief
2601697 will you reduce our force levels in the summer of 08 as planned
2601698 the adoption of its new plan to activate the file of building schools pointing out that they the commission was able to deduct the amount of 750 million dollars to supplement the educational process which was allocated mostly for building schools
2601699 it is through contact with those of professors in the various states to reach the fact that they wish to return to the country and contributing to build at the same time stressing that there is coordination between highly of the education committee and the ministry of higher education aims to develop practical measures to facilitate the return of teachers to iraq
2601700 investment in a country like iraqs oil is not only in the area of oil
2601701 good luck those of you that are coming to gordon in 2009 youre not going to be able to double major take electives or have time to relax but youll have a theology class which would be more helpful to you in the real world than say literature or sociology or psychology or any of the other under represented majors in the core right
2601702 i dont love you im just passing the time you could love me if i knew how to lie but who could love me i am out of my mind throw an old line out to sea to see if i can catch a dream
2601703 irish coach charlie weis is tougher than i am that i can tell you so its easier playing for an easy going guy like me
2601704 obviously playing in front of 80 000 people at notre dame pays big dividends it doesnt faze him when he comes here
2601705 the road has taken a lot of the great ones hank williams buddy holly otis redding janis jimi hendrix elvis its a goddamn impossible way of life
2601706 and its far and away the best guest performance here
2601707 its a pity it took us so much time to score in the first half we had many opportunities we displayed a lot of desire in the second half
2601708 te v a poner haciendo el pino puente en madison

2601710 whoa i like this melody a lot how could i possibly have forgotten it
2601711 oh daddy the microwave burnt out can we fix it
2601712 by the time i am finished in politics i want to see aung san suu kyi not only released but in power in burma
2601713 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2601714 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2601715 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2601716 the surge has succeeded yet commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2601717 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2601718 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2601719 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines
2601720 we want to make a documentary about ordinary womens attitudes and concerns towards prostitutes and prostitution based on the wi passing a motion saying prostitutes should be protected
2601721 fine heres the money show us a rough cut when youve made it
2601722 i like that but how exactly are you going to do it and precisely what are you going to show and what conclusions will you come to and how are you going to get empathy and excitement
2601723 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became egocentric and narcissistic
2601724 i want to become the leader of the free world
2601725 when you graduate from u va it means a little more because of the honor system and i would argue thats the same for someone taking classes
2601726 the honor system is defined by the philosophy and the spirit of integrity that we want to uphold here at the university of virginia
2601727 there certainly were a lot of things talked about and it was all very important to me as long as rutgers and the state of new jersey are committed to being the best were going to grow responsibly i think thats what weve done
2601728 could i have had it if i wanted yes but im part of something bigger than just football im part of rutgers university
2601729 i felt the commitment was there i dont want to do things that way when youre part of something there has to be trust
2601730 ive been at a few places and theres always some dissent its not just at rutgers
2601731 no matter how popular the program is theres always a faction that doesnt agree with it i dont feel any pressure and i dont think our players do
2601732 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2601733 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2601734 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2601735 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2601736 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2601737 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2601738 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2601739 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2601740 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2601741 dell is going after mac one of the new styles will put the air to shame it has 8 hours of battery life and you can plug whatever you want into it two of my friends already got them and they immediately threw their air in the trash
2601742 where are you going what are you doing do you like sitting at home all the time
2601743 why are you picking on a man when hes down its only a simple slump now leave the guy alone you bum
2601744 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2601745 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2601746 to put it bluntly people dont have sex on facebook
2601747 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2601760 the teenagers and college students who left their homes to march in the streets of birmingham and montgomery the mothers who walked instead of taking the bus after a long day of doing somebody elses laundry and cleaning somebody elses kitchen they didnt brave fire hoses and billy clubs so that their grandchildren and their great grandchildren would still wonder at the beginning of the 21st century whether their vote would be counted whether their civil rights would be protected by their government whether justice would be equal and opportunity would be theirs we have more work to do

2601766 there is nothing in the world more dangerous than highly enthusiastic incompetents
2601767 there is going to be a vote september 30 will not come and go without a vote on the opening the outer continental shelf the message has been delivered the issue cant be ignored any longer
2601768 bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full fair debate consisting of full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives
2601769 shut up you silly bitch its just a bit of fun
2601770 i dont give me love to straight men you guys dont have the mind set to appreciate the experience
2601771 you want my meat i can read it in your eyes
2601772 the desires of my eyes are free but it is with the heart that you must pay to play
2601773 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch
2601774 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
2601775 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch
2601776 itll open doors for me personally if he becomes president
2601777 its a momentous thing to have a black president given americas history some people say its not a big deal but it is a very big deal the u s is a model for the world if people see a black man can be president of the u s maybe they will see me differently if hes special im special
2601778 hes almost talking about black nationalism hes very liberal hes very much a black politician whereas today hes a politician who happens to be black
2601779 i think thats a question for barack obama not me
2601780 theres more interest in the american election than in the lithuanian election which is right next door its a global election
2601781 i feel compelled to warn you all about the dangers of complacency i think there are lessons here for all of us we must ensure that those that we lobby be it for funding or for action are properly aware of the issues and that we back claims of deprivation up with evidence and example therefore those of you that work in rural development organisations you are free to go on with your work i urge you to consider the way you present your concerns carefully especially in the face of competition for funding and potential cynicism about the need for support
2601782 my failure to perform my public duties brought shame and disgrace on myself and my loved ones
2601783 i allowed my inner conflicts to consume my better judgment i have no excuse and i am now prepared to pay my debt to the community
2601784 he was looking for any way out and he saw the weakness in my client
2601785 were talking about the regime with the worst human rights record in the continent and the army with the worst human rights record in the continent with the greatest u s support including the contractors or mercenaries so the fact that this regime was involved in this liberation does not and should not and cannot cover up the fact that it is a horrendous regime
2601786 torture massacres disappearances and killings of noncombatants are widespread and collusion between the armed forces and paramilitary groups continues to this day in 2006 u s assistance to colombia amounted to an estimated 728 million approximately 80 percent of which was military and police assistance
2601787 supplied directly or through contractors troop transportation planning facilities and fuel to colombian military aircraft including the helicopter crew accused of dropping the bomb
2601788 senator obama unequivocally opposes giving retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies and has cosponsored senator dodds efforts to remove that provision from the fisa bill granting such immunity undermines the constitutional protections americans trust the congress to protect senator obama supports a filibuster of this bill and strongly urges others to do the same
2601789 wrong vote regrettable many democrats will do this we should be standing up for the constitution when sen obama is president he will im sure work to fix some of this but its going to be a lot easier to prevent it now than to try to fix it later
2601790 senator obama we are a proud group of your supporters who believe in your call for hope and a new kind of politics please reject the politics of fear on national security vote against this bill and lead other democrats to do the same
2601791 sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified my core position has never changed ive always been a proponent of free trade
2601792 i actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix
2601793 the nuclear revival that we often hear about is not actually happening it is a very carefully fabricated illusion there are no buyers wall street is not putting a penny of private capital into the industry despite 100 plus percent subsidies
2601794 basically we can have as many nuclear plants as congress can force the taxpayers to pay for but you wont get any in a market economy
2601795 the first issue to come up for me would be the spread of nuclear weapons which it greatly facilitates if you look at places like iran and north korea how do you think theyre doing it iran claims to be making electricity vital to its development the technology materials equipment skills are applicable to both the president is absolutely right in identifying the spread of nuclear weapons as the gravest threat to our security so its really puzzling to me that hes trying to accelerate that spread every way he can think of its just an awful idea unless youre really interested in making bombs hes really triggered a new mideast arms race by trying to push nuclear power within the region
2601796 about as fat a terrorist target as you can imagine it is not necessary to fly a plane into a nuclear plant or storm a plant and take over a control room in order to cause that material to be largely released you can often do it from outside the site boundary with things the terrorists would have readily available
2601797 it stays dangerous for a very long time so you have to put it someplace that stays away from people and life and water for a very long time millions of years most likely so far all the places weve looked turned out to be geologically unsuitable including yucca mountain
2601798 one of the big reasons we have an oil problem and a climate problem today is we spent our money on the wrong stuff if we had spent it on efficiency and renewables those problems wouldve gone away and we wouldve made trillions of dollars profit on the deal because its so much cheaper to save energy than to supply it
2601799 part of the reason is that the people who write about global warming for most newspapers and tv are not the same people as those who tend to cover weather in general the media is covering this as all sort of unconnected events just regular weather maybe gone a little wacky but in fact the scientific community has predicted for more than two decades now that as we pour more heat trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere the planet will heat up and that would redistribute water if you heat up the planet you evaporate more water and areas that are wetter will tend to see more intense rainfall and deluges and earlier snowmelts and all that will lead to flooding so what were seeing is exactly what scientists have been telling us would happen because of human emissions
2601800 not even a few weeks before this all happened we were in the middle of doing a climate change series thats going to run over the year we had two page graphic talking about the different things that would happen in iowa as a result of climate change and pointing out that you would expect more torrential rains what has happened here is consistent with many scientists view of what global warming will mean in the midwest
2601801 if a meteorologist cant speak to the fundamental science of climate change then maybe the ams american meteorological society shouldnt give them a seal of approval if a meteorologist has an ams seal of approval which is used to confer legitimacy to tv meteorologists then meteorologists have a responsibility to truly educate themselves on the science of global warming
2601802 weve got to have a national mission of converting our economy and the example for the world is solar energy 4 billion years of supply it is environmentally benign decentralized makes us energy independent and replaces the exxonmobil peabody coal uranium complex that is why we have got to go for economic political health and safety reasons
2601803 lone professional moralist complains to fcc which issues a declaratory order against station station goes to court
2601804 if we want an improvement in radio the basic situation of broadcasting must be such that artists and thinkers have a place to work with freedom
2601805 depressing inability to appreciate that in our land of cultural pluralism there are many who think act and talk differently from the members of this court and who do not share their fragile sensibilities
2601806 we were founded on a very basic double standard this country was founded by slave owners who wanted to be free am i right a group of slave owners who wanted to be free so they killed a lot of white english people in order to continue owning their black african people so they could wipe out the rest of the red indian people and move west and steal the rest of the land from the brown mexican people giving them a place to take off and drop their nuclear weapons on the yellow japanese people you know what the motto of this country ought to be you give us a color well wipe it out
2601807 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch
2601808 omg thats not cool you totally need to report him for misconduct audrey file a misconduct report
2601809 if the people we love are stolen from us the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them
2601810 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch
2601811 to sit alone with my conscience will be judgment enough for me
2601812 our dominant media are ultimately accountable only to corporate boards whose mission is not life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for the whole body of our republic but the aggrandizement of corporate executives and shareholders
2601813 hes a mouthpiece for the largest media corporations and that kind of omnipotent power that these large networks have taking control of that and taking that power back from them is what this conference is about
2601814 rupert murdoch said the best thing that will come out of the iraq war will be oil at 20 a barrel now today when i came here i looked and it was 130 something when is rupert going to explain why the war didnt give us 20 a barrel oil
2601815 we are holding this demonstration because we are hungry we need to eat we need to work we are hungry thats all we are hungry
2601816 the specter of widespread hunger malnutrition and social unrest on an unprecedented scale
2601817 hunger is on the march here garbage is carefully sifted for whatever food might be left young babies wail in frustration seeking milk from a mother too anemic to produce it
2601818 burning food today so as to serve the mobility of the rich countries is a crime against humanity
2601819 the truth of the matter is its in our national interests that our farmers grow energy as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or may not like us
2601820 is this a price blip no a food shortage not that either we are in a structural meltdown the direct result of three decades of neoliberal globalization we have allowed food to be transformed from something that nourishes people and provides them with secure livelihoods into a commodity for speculation and bargaining
2601821 the amount of speculative money in commodities futures was less than 5 billion in 2000 last year it ballooned to roughly 175 billion
2601822 seriously bec look at me like that again and i will smack you down bitch
2601823 hate breeds hate the united states said they were doing this to rout out terrorism who is engaged in terrorism now
2601824 im very happy to be in sudan but im very sad because of the situation of our brothers who remain in guantanamo conditions in guantanamo are very very bad and they get worse by the day our human condition our human dignity was violated and the american administration went beyond all human values all moral values all religious values in guantanamo you have animals that are called iguanas rats that are treated with more humanity but we have people from more than 50 countries that are completely deprived of all rights and privileges and they will not give them the rights that they give to animals
2601825 they hold the quran in contempt destroyed it several times and put their dirty feet on it they also sat on the quran while trying to get us angry they repeatedly committed violations against our dignity and our sexual organs
2601826 during these times the interrogations were all about al jazeera and alleged relations between al jazeera and al qaida they tried to induce him to spy on his colleagues at al jazeera
2601827 obama represents all the promise of america that a biracial man from a broken family can rise and have a strong shot of becoming our next president
2601828 im not endorsing anybody our country has elected white males from northern european countries going back now 230 or so years this finally represents that the top position in american government is really open to everyone and i think thats sending a powerful message not only to americans but throughout the world
2601829 in justice inside the scandal that rocked the bush administration
2601830 is when you send voter information to a group of people that you have reason to believe are no longer there such as military personnel who are overseas such as students at historically black colleges when it comes back as undeliverable the party uses that information to remove that person from the voter rolls claiming they are no longer there it is a reprehensible practice i had never heard of it until after i left office
2601831 i hope the media keeps shining the spotlight on groups like the american center for voting rights which has been engaging in this type of voter suppression action especially targeting the elderly people and minorities if you are an american citizen who is not a felon you have the right to vote i would just hope that in swing states like missouri wisconsin new mexico and a handful of other states that the democratic party and the media really keep a lot of pressure on this
2601832 to sit alone with my conscience will be judgment enough for me
2601833 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
2601834 so while it was a terrible mistake for the administration to rely on the erroneous intelligence about wmd and i mean it was catastrophic to our credibility first of all it was an honest error and not a lie but even if you correct it for that error what we found in iraq was a serious wmd threat even though saddam hussein had chosen to not maintain the stockpiles he had put himself in a position where he could have regenerated those stockpiles in three to five weeks
2601835 to prove that there is nothing is almost impossible i think that if we had been in iraq for a couple of months more it would have been enough to make it extremely clear to everybody that the chances were real that there were no weapons of mass destruction
2601836 i wish to heaven that they had listened a little better to what i had to say if they did listen
2601837 it is hard to avoid the impression that almost 20 years after the end of the cold war military calculations still dominate the long term thinking about major global relations terrorism is formally made the chief enemy but precautions are taken against the growing power of china and russia
2601838 the idea of giving enriched uranium to the saudis while threatening war with the iranians for enriching uranium is astonishing the idea that the saudis are going to somehow lower the price of oil on the basis of possibly getting nuclear reactors in the future is just almost staggering to think about
2601839 then i think its very likely that the chinese who have not ratified will follow if china does it maybe india does if india does pakistan does etc and the treaty would enter into force it would be a great thing if we outlawed any nuclear weapons tests in the future
2601840 to negotiate a new instrument of international humanitarian law banning cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians

2601875 it is to say the least thought provoking and of some concern that the majority of young people might despair at the constant negative reporting of their school achievements whilst working harder when they are only doing what we ask of them through the educational challenges that we set
2601876 einstein struggled with his school diploma and charlotte brontes school report in 1825 said that she knew nothing about grammar and wrote indifferently so whats new
2601877 we conclude that a bill of rights and freedoms should not include directly enforceable duties
2601878 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2601879 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2601880 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2601881 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of they way the reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2601882 distract from the real solutions that we all know we have our concern is that biofuels will distract people away from other solutions
2601883 its the long term environmental implications that we should be worried about
2601884 its difficult to predict what the long term consequences would be in the forests you have a vast number of species and a diverse ecosystem the trees last for a long time if something goes wrong the consequences are quite long term and significant
2601885 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions the wind at the time was a south westerly force 5 7 with a moderate to rough sea state generating a heavy surf
2601886 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions

2601890 that is to say i do not believe it exists as a separate genre of writing rather i think legal writing belongs to that large undifferentiated unglamorous category of writing known as non fiction prose someone who is a good legal writer would but for the need to master a different substantive subject be an equivalently good writer of history economics or indeed theology
2601891 it became clear to me as i think it must become to clear to anyone who is burdened with the job of teaching legal writing that what these students lacked was not the skill of legal writing but the skill of writing at all
2601892 what i hoped to have conveyed to my charges in those years were merely the prerequisites for self improvement in writing which are two things number one the realization and it occurred to my students as an astounding revelation that there is an immense difference between writing and good writing and two that it takes time and sweat to convert the former into the later
2601893 i think the law firms may not have learned the lesson that kaye scholer learned in the 1980s
2601894 lawyers smart people though they are are not immune from any of this
2601895 it can be expected that if we can identify problems we will then ask where were the lawyers
2601896 he said in an interview following the discussion a typical aiding and abetting scenario might be a law firm that aids misrepresentation in a prospectus for a mortgage backed security he said he cautioned that he was speaking for himself and not the sec
2601897 no one said no to the president the lawyers carried with them no weapons but the principles of our constitution

2601965 los intereses de la deuda pagados s lo representan el dos por ciento del pbi no hay ninguna raz n realmente objetiva que ponga en duda la econom a argentina
2601966 lo que s hay es una puja de intereses estamos frente a nuevas discusiones a la que no est bamos acostumbrados y no hay ninguno dato de la econom a argentina que d sustento a eso y sin dudas son especulaciones

2601989 the wiki lets outside sources come and analyze work like a real world situation
2601990 it lets students truly speak their mind and say whats important without feeling embarrassed
2601991 responses to writing are the only way someone will know how to write better next time these make the wiki and blog beneficial when it comes to writing
2601992 sometimes its hard to take criticism but being able to be anonymous on weblogs helps students to write down whats really on their mind and gives them freedom that doesnt always exist in the classroom
2601993 one of the goals and benefits of the wiki and blog is that it allows for interaction between classes and can be helpful for peer review and discussion
2601994 blogging anonymously allows everyone to get their writing reviewed and analyzed by anyone intermixing classes gives us all more valuable feedback
2601995 to the extent one agrees with another the closer a friendship the fewer areas of agreement the weaker the friendship if you disagree you are my enemy
2601996 all morning classes are canceled due to an explosive device found in herter hall
2601997 maybe we should focus more on actual writing than learning how to use the wiki
2601998 not only are the students in each class learning how to use the new technology they are also learning how to write knowing the public has access to their work
2601999 through this avenue of communication we are able to become involved in coversation with people who have an interest in what we write
2602000 intra class feedback is just as useful as inter class feedback and that the use of disagreeable online tools would be helpful for a class on those topics not a writing class

2602044 also there is her long running dispute with former black panther party bpp leader elaine brown who was also seeking the greens presidential nomination until withdrawing late last year some supporters of mckinney recklessly accused brown of being an fbi agent certainly mckinney cant be automatically blamed for the mistakes of her supporters but her refusal to clearly and forcefully distance herself from these outlandish claims is not positive

2602048 her refusal to clearly and forcefully distance herself from these outlandish claims
2602049 the idea that elaine brown is an fbi agent is so utterly absurd on the face of it what she is is exactly what she has done and represents herself as it is perfectly ok for greens to disagree with each other but the continued insinuations of elaine brown being some sort of police agent must be repudiated publicly by all greens the national leadership should make an unambiguous statement urging all greens to stop making such comments and all candidates seeking our nomination should make their positions on this issue explicitly clear what has been done to elaine brown is inexcusable and must be refuted by all i for one wish to apologize to elaine that such accusations have been tolerated within the green party

2602059 youre not some club kid in new york in the nineties this shit is so hipster
2602060 if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck
2602061 if only we carried rocks instead of cameras wed look like revolutionaries
2602062 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2602063 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2602064 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2602065 mir que corto pero corto gancho en serio cucharita cuchar n no me junto mas con vos
2602066 vete de aqu de mi lado que no sepan que he llorado por ti
2602067 tonta tonta esta situacion yo ya lo la aguanto pero esto me pasa tan solo por quererte tanto
2602068 como te lo digo que te necesito no encuentro palabras
2602069 bailamos cachete con cachete juntamos pechito con pechito movemos ombligo con ombligo
2602070 chufa chufa con las manos chufa chufa chufa con los pies
2602071 vamos a reinventar otra vez el chufa cha lo atrapas en el aire y en tu mano lo guardas
2602072 una cosa son los valores que se ense an en la familias y otra qu se debe ense ar para ser buen ciudadano y vivir en sociedad ya que son dos ideas totalmente diferentes
2602073 la condici n de ciudadano no te la da tu familia sino el sistema pol tico
2602074 esp ritu cr tico mejor o peor formado y al menos en mi libertad personal puedo elegir y decidir qu o no se adapta a mi forma de pensar o vivir
2602075 espa a es muchas veces injustamente catalogada como un pa s que tiene una vida c vica muy limitada porque tiene muy poca participaci n en asociaciones voluntarias pero s tiene lazos familiares muy fuertes y muchas comunidades est n intactas incluso en las ciudades
2602076 una cosa son los valores que se ense an en la familias y otra qu se debe ense ar para ser buen ciudadano y vivir en sociedad ya que son dos ideas totalmente diferentes
2602077 la condici n de ciudadano tambi n te la puede quitar el sistema pol tico de turno
2602078 no es la familia el lugar ideal para interiorizar y vivir las virtudes
2602079 not getting off the bus when she was supposed to
2602080 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2602081 its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2602082 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2602083 i always have believed that the australian public make a very clear distinction between voting for a territory government or voting for a state government and voting for a federal government
2602084 they understand fully all the implications of our federal system so i dont draw too much into the northern territory result and i wont draw too much from the west australian result other than to say we know it will be a tough election
2602085 but the liberals have been very much in disarray here wa and wa premier alan carpenters done a good job in difficult circumstances so whilst we think it will be tough were confident that alan carpenter will do well
2602086 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2602087 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign i think it is always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results on to federal results or vice versa
2602088 global scenarios both real mass suffering in impoverished parts of the world and imagined terrorists on every street corner will elicit in the years ahead no lack of collective worry and fear and americans of conscience must consider carefully how to deal with it just after the autumnal equinox september 22nd saturn and uranus will begin opposing each other in the sky the most important aspect of the rest of this calendar year this past week we had a preview of it when mars opposed uranus many of my clients were skittish and sleepless paranoia was racing through the mass mind like tumbleweed when unmoored from spiritual grounding fretful virgo and reality challenged pisces threaten to pitch us into overwhelm a state that will not help us deal conscientiously with the intense times ahead
2602089 the higher meaning of the saturn uranus transit is to instill within each of us a sense of responsibility saturn for the explosive information uranus coming to light in our world
2602090 it is time to understand none of the global challenges being heatedly discussed right now by ecologists by international social justice groups by concerned citizens amongst themselves is new or surprising to anyone who has been paying attention we are seeing conditions long in the making rendered obvious for the sake of wrenching the collective into a new consciousness
2602091 you gotta love a donut shop that misspells its own name
2602092 ketika ini saya tidak nampak sesiapa calon tentunya dari bn anwar akan menang tapi apa yang menarik ialah margin sama ada undi lebih besar dan lebih kecil dari apa yang beliau anwar dapat pada masa lalu
2602093 jika majoriti undi yang diperolehi anwar kurang umno boleh terus ke depan untuk kembali mendapat sokongan rakyat
2602094 tak mungkin saya telah berundur pada 2003 dan saya telah kata saya tidak akan datang semula tetapi saya punya hak sebagai warga untuk membuat ulasan mengenai negara saya
2602095 terpulang siapa calon bebas yang bertanding kalau dia dari serpihan pas kemungkinan ia akan mengurangkan undi kepada anwar kalau dia bekas umno maka dia akan menambah kelebihan undi kepada anwar tetapi tidak ada kemungkinan calon bebas ini akan menang
2602096 ku li tengku razaleigh harus menilai sokongan ahli saya dapati cuma di peringkat rendah akar umbi yang menyokongnya sebaliknya pak lah mendapat sokongan dari ketua ketua bahagian umno sehingga mereka tidak boleh buka mulut sama sekali
2602097 dulu mereka ketua bahagian yang pernah cabar datuk seri abdullah sekarang senyap saya fikir susah bagi tengku razaleigh untuk menang
2602098 what we wanted to do was shift some of the focus away from the negative to the positive

2602106 no se porqu cita con tanta profusi n a los padres cat licos
2602107 indudablemente los cat licos intentamos transmitir las creencias propias a los hijos ser a absurdo no hacerlo
2602108 no veo que sea incompatible ser buen fiel y aut nomo a la vez

2602113 qu aporta a la sociedad que la uni n de homosexuales se considere matrimonio
2602114 nosotros como sociedad hemos sido demasiado sensibles para no herir los sentimientos de los ciudadanos con objeto de evitar parecer excesivamente cr ticos hemos dejado de decir lo que hay que decir llevamos d cadas en las que se han ido paulatinamente erosionando la responsabilidad las virtudes sociales la autodisciplina el respeto mutuo las conquistas a largo a cambio de la satisfacci n inmediata por el contrario preferimos la neutralidad moral no entrar en juicios de valor acerca de lo que son comportamientos adecuados o equivocados malo bueno correcto impropio son palabras que nuestro sistema pol tico y nuestro sector p blico apenas se atreven a utilizar
2602115 de acuerdo no soy ajeno al estupor que estas palabras producen en la boca de un pol tico est n en su derecho de preguntar qu pasa con ustedes miren d jenme que les diga una cosa somos humanos cometemos errores y nos achantamos con frecuencia nuestras relaciones se rompen se deshacen nuestros matrimonios fallamos como padres y como ciudadanos igual que todos ustedes pero si el resultado de todo esto es un silencio c mplice acerca de las cosas que realmente importan entonces estamos fallando por partida doble renunciar al uso de esas palabras malo bueno correcto impropio implica una negaci n de la responsabilidad personal y una ca da en el relativismo moral
2602116 corremos el riesgo de convertirnos en una sociedad amoral donde ya nadie diga la verdad acerca de lo que est bien y lo que est mal de lo que es correcto o resulta impropio la consecuencia es terrible la ausencia de l mites hace que nuestros hijos piensen que pueden hacer lo que les parezca ya que ning n adulto intervendr para ponerles freno ni siquiera a menudo los propios padres y eso tiene que terminar
2602117 el problema en espa a es que la asignatura y su contenido ha sido fabricado por la universidad carlos iii socialista y la fundaci n cives socialista
2602118 se trata de imponer una forma de ver la vida y los que no piensan igual a callar
2602119 al final llegamos a lo que impera poner la ciencia y la tecnolog a en la cima de todo hacer depender la moralidad de mayor as y del dogma de la modernidad de que lo ultimo es lo mejor que la humanidad solo avanza merced a los descubrimientos t cnicos

2602122 los valores no dependen de la democracia ni de la mayor a los valores lo son en si mismos de la misma manera que los derechos humanos son universales en la medida en que no dependen de mayorias cambiantes o de interpretaciones hist ricas
2602123 this is not about me trying to force a political candidate on you and trying to see how you vote
2602124 i wanted to thank all of you who contributed to mitt romney you cant realize how much leverage this gives huron going forward to ask various people for business
2602125 if anyone at huron consulting felt pressured to contribute we stand ready to refund the donations if requested
2602126 is not something a ceo of a public company should do
2602127 is some of the best practice development money huron could spend
2602128 he has given huron a large jp morgan tax case and he is a young mover and shaker at mayer brown
2602129 you often contribute based on which friend asked you to
2602130 i dont think our business turns on anything but getting the best people to do the work
2602131 i soon received a third call from muneer satter at goldman sachs asking for my help in raising more funds
2602132 i again reminded muneer that i couldnt make any promises but business from goldman sachs would be well appreciated and that i hope he knows that i am going to call him and his partners in the future asking for business from goldman
2602133 mr satter did not personally raise any money from mr holdren nor does he have a business or personal relationship with him furthermore he has never given any business to huron consulting

2602145 negotiating any piece of legislation through the senate is always a challenge
2602146 i have had discussions with some of the cross bench senators theyll continue and we will continue to argue vigorously for fuelwatch
2602147 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity

2602152 a lot of people ask me why did it take you so long to make it to hollywood
2602153 he says his flyaway silver bangs hanging over his eyebrows
2602154 its natural because society for a long time has been telling us oye at 60 whoosh retire at 40 start waving goodbye and its like no no no you know how we talk about reinventing life nowadays and staying with it and persevering and doing what you want i think people of my generation the baby boomers need to hear that story because its almost like a philosophy for us to continue living
2602155 you didnt let me give you the love i wanted to give you so im going to give it to you now
2602156 if you walk up to some of these cubans and say you want to be a piano player youre going to get smacked across the face

2602162 i was able to start giving thanks for something i had lost instead of being angry for the loss when all you can see is remorse and rancor and bitterness

2602171 the book of memory a study of memory in medieval culture
2602172 their greatest geniuses they describe as people of superior memories they boast unashamedly of their prowess in that faculty and they regard it as a mark of superior moral character as well as intellect
2602173 ive found my only success in getting this chant to stick is to know exactly what each word means and try to link the meaning of the text with the melody or texture of the phrases
2602174 why does humility sing gaudete rejoice at the very bottom of her range if i have an answer to that ill be able to remember the phrase structure
2602175 if you can read hildegards original notation you know theres a clear hierarchy to the notes in her chants something thats often lost in transcription
2602176 once you get a sense of this hierarchy youre able to make a connection with the music
2602177 the other night i actually had a dream in which ordo made an appearance
2602178 in the dream i had a chant absolutely stuck in my head i awoke in a state of confusion and decided to give myself the day off from practicing so that my apparently weary brain could have a rest
2602179 is about a hundred times harder to memorize than music that came along later

2602194 de reis is niet zonder gevaar en zal lang duren de sterren aan de hemel zullen je de weg wijzen uiteindelijk zal de nacht voorbij gaan en wanneer je het ochtendgloren kunt zien weet dan dat het nieuwe land bijna bereikt is en de haven spoedig in zicht zal zijn ikzelf zal jullie daar opwachten om jullie allen te ontvangen in mijn land volg daarom altijd het licht want het zal je thuis brengen
2602195 waarom wilt u de rupsen verzamelen wat zullen ze gaan doen in dat nieuwe land
2602196 in mijn koninkrijk zullen ze worden wie ze werkelijk zijn zodra ze het zonlicht zullen voelen zullen zij een transformatieproces ondergaan en uiteindelijk prachtige vlinders worden vrij om te genieten van het eeuwige licht vrij om zich te koesteren in de stralen van mijn liefde vrij om het beloofde land te bewonen in volkomen vrede en vreugde

2602204 daar heeft de kapitein nooit iets over verteld ik dacht dat wij het enige schip waren
2602205 de koning van het licht vertelde mij dat er voor alle rupsen uiteindelijk schepen zouden komen zodat iedereen uit het land van duisternis gered zou worden dat was ik helemaal vergeten en doordat het op onze reis altijd zo donker was zijn deze schepen ons niet eerder opgevallen ach maar wat maakt het uit ik ben slechts verantwoordelijk voor d t schip als wij maar de haven bereiken dat is het belangrijkste daar zal de koning van het licht ons namelijk opwachten zoals je weet en dan zijn wij tenminste gered
2602206 misschien kunnen wij als we in het beloofde land zijn de koning wel helpen met het verzamelen van de overige schepen die nog onderweg zijn want als wij de haven eenmaal hebben gevonden kunnen wij alle andere schepen de weg wijzen
2602207 hier moet je zijn hier is de ingang naar het beloofde land

2602221 hopelijk komt ze in het beloofde land tot inzicht en zal ze daar weer blaadjes gaan eten
2602222 zolang ik maar aan boord van het schip ben kan me niets gebeuren en zal de kapitein er wel voor zorgen dat we dit land zullen bereiken misschien is het al vlakbij want ik kan het tenslotte al ruiken

2602226 is het niet heerlijk om te kunnen zien en vliegen
2602227 maar het is zo verdrietig dat de andere rupsen deze vreugde niet met ons kunnen delen
2602228 ik kon er cht niets aan doen hoor maar ik kon de blaadjes niet meer eten mijn buik zat al z vol de rupsen begrepen het niet daarom ben ik in mijn eigen holletje gekropen misschien heb ik vroeger wel teveel blaadjes gegeten ik had tenslotte altijd honger als de verzorger met de mand kwam en zorgde dat ik er als eerste van kon eten die blaadjes smaakten altijd zo heerlijk
2602229 jullie zullen dan allemaal vlinders worden en dan kunnen jullie de andere schepen tegemoet vliegen om hen te vertellen waar ze naartoe moeten
2602230 dat moet het zijn nu zijn we er cht bijna

2602234 zo direct zal de koning van het licht komen om ons welkom te heten dan weten we zeker dat we bij de goede haven zijn
2602235 ik denk dat we hier wel kunnen aanmeren dat doen de andere schepen ook
2602236 want wij zijn het eerste schip dat de haven zal binnenvaren wij zullen worden opgewacht door de koning en vervolgens zullen al onze rupsen door hem in vlinders worden veranderd en zullen we de koning meehelpen om alle schepen de weg te wijzen zo is het en niet anders en als jij het hier niet mee eens bent stuurman dan kun je maar beter dit schip verlaten kijk om je heen er zijn schepen genoeg waar je naartoe kunt of wat mij betreft zwem je maar naar het land ik ben al bang dat je dan zult verdrinken

2602240 ik weet het niet maar het lijkt wel of ik bijna knap
2602241 ik kan cht geen blaadjes meer eten ik wil al nog maar terug naar mijn stille warme plekje onder het raam
2602242 maar rupsje je moet toch eten anders ga je dood
2602243 nee bedankt het gaat cht niet meer ik krijg er zon buikpijn van
2602244 zijn de blaadjes soms verlept of uitgedroogd is er iets mis met de boom
2602245 nee hoor het ligt niet aan de blaadjes die zijn heerlijk vers en sappig zoals altijd en de andere rupsen eten er w l van en voelen zich er goed bij maar ik kan ze niet meer verdragen ik hoef niets meer te eten
2602246 nou kom dan maar eens bij mijn lantarentje misschien dat de warmte je beter doet voelen
2602247 dan is er voor mij geen taak meer op dit schip
2602248 what in your opinion is the single biggest environmental problem the world faces at this time
2602249 do you think the federal government should do more than it
2602250 i m going to read you a list of environmental problems as i read each one please tell me if you personally worry about this problem a great deal a fair amount only a little or not at all
2602251 you may have heard about the idea that the world
2602252 thinking about the reporting you ve seen or heard recently about global warming in the news media do you think the media generally exaggerate the threat of climate change from global warming don

2602257 from what you know about global climate change or global warming which one of the following statements comes closest to your opinion
2602258 es wird nicht einfach weil die anderen im gegensatz zu uns nicht in bestbesetzung geschwommen sind
2602259 s dkorea das hat die erfahrung aus den letzten gro en turnieren gezeigt kann jedes spitzenteam der welt schlagen
2602260 i felt guilty about not campaigning and so as a consequence ive decided that i would try to give you something special ive decided that on my first full day of campaigning in michigan that i wouldnt be fooling around that i wasnt just going to do the same old thing but i decided that i was going to bring up one of the greatest leaders we have in the democratic party please give it up for my friend john edwards
2602261 what is worst of all is to advocate christianity not because it is true but because it might prove useful to justify christianity because it provides a foundation of morality instead of showing the necessity of christian morality from the truth of christianity is a very dangerous inversion and we may reflect that a good deal of the attention of totalitarian states has been devoted with a steadfastness of purpose not always found in democracies to providing their national life with a foundation of morality the wrong kind perhaps but a good deal more of it it is not enthusiasm but dogma that differentiates a christian from a pagan society
2602262 not only when thou wast born into the world did christ love thee but his delights were with the sons of men before there were any sons of men often did he think of them from everlasting to everlasting he had set his affections upon them i am sure he would not have loved me so long if he had had not been a changeless lover if he could grow weary of me he would have been tired of me long before now if he had not loved me with a love as deep as life and as strong as death he would have turned from me long ago oh joy above all joys to know that i am his everlasting and inalienable inheritance given to him by his father
2602263 by explaining the evolution of the altar call and salvation prayer mcintyre identifies why most americans think they are born again
2602264 there is an urgent need for courageous preachers in the pulpits of the world today like the apostles in the early church who were all filled with the holy spirit and spoke the word of god with boldness acts 4 31
2602265 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2602266 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2602267 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2602268 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2602269 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2602270 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2602271 linda gave me the best hair cut ever worth every dollar indeed
2602272 the church has surrendered her once lofty concept of god and has substituted for it one so low so ignoble as to be utterly unworthy of thinking worshiping men this she has done not deliberately but little by little and without her knowledge and her very unawareness only makes her situation all the more tragic this low view of god entertained almost universally among christians is the cause of a hundred lesser evils everywhere among us a whole new philosophy of the christian life has resulted from this one basic error in our religious thinking with our loss of the sense of majesty has come the further loss of religious awe and consciousness of the divine presence we have lost our spirit of worship and our ability to withdraw inwardly to meet god in adoring silence modern christianity is simply not producing the kind of christian who can appreciate or experience the life in the spirit the words be still and know that i am god mean next to nothing to the self confident bustling worshiper in this middle period of the twentieth century this loss of the concept of majesty has come just when the forces of religion are making dramatic gains and the churches are more prosperous than at any time within the past several hundred years but the alarming thing is that our gains are mostly external and our losses wholly internal and since it is the quality of our religion that is affected by internal conditions it may be that our supposed gains are but losses spread over a wider field
2602273 there is all this difference between the sins of the righteous and those of the ungodly surprised by temptations true saints are flooded with a passing outburst of sin but the wicked delight in transgression and live in it as in their element the saint in his errors is a star under a cloud but the sinner is darkness itself the gracious may fall into iniquity but the graceless run into it wallow in it and again and again return to it
2602274 if your heart is grieved when you see the church turned into a place thats entertaining a place where you have to try to trick people to come through the door with a dog and pony show you are seeing the result of that theology if you cant trust the spirit of god to apply the gospel of christ to the hearts of his elect people and bring them to salvation youre gonna have to start reaching around for something else and thats what we see today theology matters
2602275 you know this is a matter of common honesty the great apostle says elsewhere i am an ambassador for christ what is the business of an ambassador is it to voice his own opinions is it to say what he thinks well if he does so he is a very bad ambassador the ambassadors job is to convey the thinking and the point of view of the country that has appointed him and which he is representing he may disagree with it entirely but it does not matter the business of the ambassador is to deliver the message which has been given to him to hand on this commission whatever it is and paul says i have no choice about this thats what he told me to say im not here to give you my theories and my ideas he says i am determined simply to preach what he gave me
2602276 one of the greatest needs other than preaching the gospel and true conversion is to teach on the attributes of god because people basically dont know him if i were to go into most churches and preach on the attributes of god what would happen about midway through that week is you would have faithful church members who have been there for forty years who would stand up and say thats not my god i could never love a god like that even though i m just preaching the historical christian view of god
2602277 we must never think of salvation as a kind of transaction between god and us in which he contributes grace and we contribute faith for we were dead and had to be quickened before we could believe
2602278 einstein struggled with his school diploma and charlotte brontes school report in 1825 said that she knew nothing about grammar and wrote indifferently so whats new
2602279 minimizing the importance of transformed feelings makes christian conversion less supernatural and less radical it is humanly manageable to make decisions of the will for christ no supernatural power is required to pray prayers sign cards walk aisles or even stop sleeping around those are good they just dont prove that anything spiritual has happened christian conversion on the other hand is a supernatural radical thing the heart is changed and the evidence of it is not just new decisions but new affections new feelings
2602280 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions the wind at the time was a south westerly force 5 7 with a moderate to rough sea state generating a heavy surf
2602281 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions
2602282 we conclude that a bill of rights and freedoms should not include directly enforceable duties
2602283 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2602284 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2602285 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2602286 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of they way the reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2602287 distract from the real solutions that we all know we have our concern is that biofuels will distract people away from other solutions
2602288 its the long term environmental implications that we should be worried about
2602289 its difficult to predict what the long term consequences would be in the forests you have a vast number of species and a diverse ecosystem the trees last for a long time if something goes wrong the consequences are quite long term and significant
2602290 a new decalogue has been adopted by the neo christians of our day the first word of which reads thou shalt not disagree and a new set of beatitudes too which begins blessed are they that tolerate everything for they shall not be made accountable for anything it is now the accepted thing to talk over religious differences in public with the understanding that no one will try to convert another or point out errors in his belief imagine moses agreeing to take part in a panel discussion with israel over the golden calf or elijah engaging in a gentlemanly dialogue with the prophets of baal or try to picture our lord jesus christ seeking a meeting of minds with the pharisees to iron out differences the blessing of god is promised to the peacemaker but the religious negotiator has better watch his step darkness and light can never be brought together by talk some things are not negotiable
2602291 preaching is not the proclamation of a theory or the discussion of a doubt a man has a perfect right to proclaim a theory of any sort or to discuss his doubts but that is not preaching give me the benefit of your convictions if you have any keep your doubts to yourself i have enough of my own said goethe we are never preaching when we are hazarding speculations of course we do so we are bound to speculate sometimes i sometimes say i am speculating stop taking notes speculation is not preaching neither is the declaration of negations preaching preaching is the proclamation of the word the truth as the truth has been revealed
2602292 preaching is theology coming through a man who is on fire
2602293 the doctrine of irresistible grace is easily understood once we understand the condition of man in sin that he is dead enslaved to a corrupt nature incapable of doing what is pleasing to god we can fully understand the simple assertion that god must raise the dead sinner to life that is all really the phrase means it has nothing to do with sinners rebelling against god and resisting him in that way it has nothing to do with the fact that christians often resist gods grace in their lives when they sin against him no irresistible grace means one thing god raises dead sinners to life
2602294 the massive expansion of bandwidth and subsequent centralization of content

2602320 careful students of evangelism have noticed that where the necessity of public action as a part of conversion has been most emphasized there has been a corresponding increase in the god dishonoring record of so called backsliding and this is natural the covenant of god is to keep eternally all who are truly saved and there are no other provisions than the one way of salvation by christs willing substitution whereby god can be just and still be the justifier of a sin cursed soul to attempt to come unto god on the grounds of a public performance even with great earnestness is but to fail and the misguided soul who makes that attempt when his hope has proven false is often the hardest to reach thereafter
2602321 we did have quite a lot of stuff on the cultural revolution
2602322 we had a dark section you might say in the show at one time but it sat there so awkwardly it sort of brought the show to a halt
2602323 youve got a huge tv audience all sitting there with their remote controls and you think about that when youre doing a show like this
2602324 the purpose of the olympic ceremony in the end is not to launder the dirty washing of the country thats putting on the event its to celebrate the positive things about the country
2602325 theres a conceit in these creative meetings that people should show no inhibitions and think of the most ridiculous things they can
2602326 eventually you have to drag it back down to earth and remind everybody that they are on a planet that has gravity that stuff is made of materials and there will be a man with a chequebook who will be reluctant to spend infinite amounts of cash
2602327 its a great relief when you have something that complicated you can really get your knickers in a twist if things begin to go wrong it went very well

2602356 what is this shi oh my god its gooey pistachioiey cheesy delightfulness
2602357 after having spent days in the real life old jerusalem i find myself with the experience to say that this place does not fit the bill
2602358 who the crap are these yelpers how can they be so wrong i am sorry but it upsets me
2602359 go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years
2602360 we do have world class regulators who are looking at these issues all of the time and we still have a very strong well regulated banking system
2602361 negative interaction between banking system adjustment and the real economy
2602362 while they will definitely have some headwinds over the next 18 months to two years they are still set to perform very strongly
2602363 as a prudential regulator we need to look through day to day volatility and swings in market moods to the underlying health of our regulated financial institutions
2602364 although not immune from ongoing global market disruptions there is genuine strength in the australian banking system this is not happenstance
2602365 sound risk management and robust prudential oversight have helped to ensure that our regulated institutions did not for the greater part succumb to the temptations that laid a number of their international competitors low
2602366 made a point of ringing around the major banks after the rba had announced a cut in the cash rate demanding to know when each bank was going to be announcing a cut in its mortgage rate
2602367 the banks followed rates up they will follow rates down
2602368 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2602369 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2602370 we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6th
2602371 tactical battalions have completely liberated tskhinvali from georgian military forces
2602372 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure

2602374 shestovs men were pascal because he had faith in the god of abraham isaac and jacob and not in the god of philosophers martin luther because he relied on
2602375 western civilization consists of two elements or has two roots which are in radical disagreement with each other
2602376 i fail to see why a disgusting store such as petersons is allowed to stay open they cater to the dregs of the streets of our city
2602377 its the fact that this particular business owner acts as if he doesnt care how he runs his establishment
2602378 potential redevelopment of this structure has been a part of an ongoing pdc process information on the structure and architectural options can be found on the pdc
2602379 in addition to the loitering along the morrison street facade the exit stairways from the parking levels at all four corners have become sleeping locations for the homeless the resulting trash and smells make the stairs unpleasant to use and give the garage a negative image for a perceived lack of cleanliness and safety
2602380 with the understanding that the 10th and yamhill garage would be redeveloped and petersons lease would be terminated
2602381 seemingly strangeness of the fishnet being such a common prop throughout the years
2602382 theres a supposition in that statement that one distinct event affects our life decisions that statement is at best a narrow way of looking at our life choices
2602383 se trata de un desaf o a la comunidad internacional
2602384 ataques de georgia contra osetia del sur estaban siendo conducidos en connivencia con algunos miembros del consejo de seguridad
2602385 llamamos a rusia a cesar sus ataques a reos y sus lanzamientos de misiles sobre georgia a respetar la integridad territorial de georgia y a retirar sus tropas terrestres del suelo georgiano
2602386 llam a todas las partes a tomar sin demora el camino de la negociaci n
2602387 tenemos un mensaje simple para los osetianos georgianos y rusos la v a militar no tiene salida
2602388 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
2602389 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
2602390 i do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies
2602391 towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict
2602392 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction
2602393 i wont talk about any specific cases or individuals but we wouldnt offer a scholarship if we knew they had problems with the law
2602394 texas is one of the hardest schools when it comes to looking at character
2602395 when youre looking at a guys physical attributes you can just watch him and find out if hes got what youre looking for you dont know if hes always going to develop but you know if the foundation is there
2602396 but its the character that weve got to do a lot of research on now
2602397 this is a hard deal we try to research guys the best we can we talk to coaches high school counselors principals parents teachers opposing coaches we talk to everybody and its still not an exact science
2602398 i think they almost ask more questions about character now than they do about a players athletic ability
2602399 well the ones that do more research some of these schools offer kids scholarships before they even come talk to us
2602400 they see them at a recruiting camp and they offer him there then they come and ask questions not texas or texas a amp m they ask questions first then offer
2602401 one of the main issues some schools have is all these high school coaches want players to go to big time programs
2602402 its a big deal when youre a high school coach and one of your players goes to texas or oklahoma florida or usc its more attention more press so these coaches want their players going to these big schools
2602403 i dont know if high school coaches lie to college coaches but they might not be 100 percent forthcoming about the kids background youve got to know a high school coach is being honest with you
2602404 if theyve got good values in their family and they tell you the truth they call you when theyre supposed to they show up when theyre supposed to they e mail back when you e mail them and theyve done things for the school and leadership with the community theyre responsible those are no brainers but that makes sense
2602405 we prefer kids from two parent families because they tend to be more stable
2602406 more recently weve accepted kids from one parent families because half the kids come from those homes now our rule is that there has to be one strong parent as a role model
2602407 if we have trouble with the parents we dont recruit the kid
2602408 if hes got a high test score and low grades it means he hasnt really been working as hard and isnt putting as much effort into school
2602409 a confident kid is going to have success and isnt as prone to falling into something because of peer pressure
2602410 youve got to talk to the assistant coaches coaches of their opponents the coaches of the opponent might not know as much about character but theyre good to talk to the more people you talk to the more you know the kid youre recruiting
2602411 youd like to think that youre aware of most of the stuff that happens off the field
2602412 even in a class 5a program you hear about most the stuff that happens off the field
2602413 the way i see it is if i have kept a kid on my football team hes worth any college recruiting if he wasnt worth it he wouldnt be on my team
2602414 there have been some times throughout my career i dont know if its 20 percent 15 percent or 10 percent sometimes guys who you think are good for your place somewhere along the line they do something that you know theyre not a fit for your place
2602415 you get fooled for a while but usually the kids characters reveal themselves

2602672 if your an alienated parent you need to know about narcissists predators
2602673 but treating you like youre nothing is just one of many ways they act out their fantasy that they are so grand that you are dirt under their feet so look out delusions of grandeur are hard to maintain and are constantly challenged by reality
2602674 for example do you have a fine reputation look out that threatens the narcissists delusion that he is the greatest so hell have to fix that fine reputation of yours do you excel at something look out that threatens the narcissists delusion that he is the greatest so hell have to sabotage your work do you have an outstanding personal virtue look out that threatens the narcissists delusion that he is the greatest so hell have to drag your virtue through the mud attributing it to himself while he portrays it in you as a vice
2602675 yes pathological envy is one of his middle names but treating others like nothing and destroying them arent the only ways narcissists act out their fantasy and maintain their delusions of grandeur those delusions evaporate without constant reinforcement so a malignant narcissist needs to prove hes god almighty by trampling someone about as frequently as most other predators need to make a kill
2602676 its just more of the same so that the narcissist can think he seems grand he must crush you like a bug underfoot therefore if you are down and out look out youre going to get kicked can he get away with abusing you behind closed doors look out and if you try to complain youll be sorry because hell have the whole world conned ahead of time into viewing you as the malicious one whos imagining things yes diabolo is another one of his middle names
2602677 in short malignant narcissists are predators who hunt easy prey to plunder them in one way or another mainly for ego gratification because they have to feel greater than you they are competing with you for every bit of it any you get they view as rightly belonging to them so they gotta take it away
2602678 this is the mentality that stands out so glaringly in the rapist from the gutter they gotta tear you down off that pedestal and treat you like dirt to prove theyre better than you
2602679 that aint natural it aint natural to hate innocence it aint natural to attack people who are no threat to you and have done you no harm it aint natural to treat the other members of ones own species as prey but psychopaths and malignant narcissists do
2602680 whether by choice or not psychopaths and malignant narcissists are able to do this because they have no human feeling whatsoever for anyone except themselves they have very very tender feelings for themselves but none for anyone else not even their own children they view human beings as objects tools to exploit for their gratification to perfect that image of theirs that they are so obsessed with
2602681 for like a child of three he doesnt relate to other people he treats you like a screw driver there for him to use or abuse for his sake he disregards the consequences to you because he refuses to grow up and know that there is a thinking feeling person inside other people and that they exist for their own sakes not his so your rights and feelings and welfare are no of consideration to him whatsoever hell break you just lightly as hed stomp an ant
2602682 never forget that for a moment forgetting it is as dangerous as walking into a hungry tigers cage forgetting that he is predator
2602683 narcissists and psychopaths often try to hide this brutal inhumanity and total lack of empathy by mimicking human emotions often melodramatically they are extremely sneaky and manipulative mainly because theyve been practicing these arts nonstop from about the age of six
2602684 unless they are so powerful they neednt hide what they are they go to great lengths to portray themselves as the very opposite of what they are they are pathological liars who tell bizarre lies they often react to things in a bizarre way that makes you pinch yourself yet despite these warning signs that there is something wrong with them and despite the mental maturity level of a little child before the age of reason they almost always pass for normal
2602685 this doesnt have to happen we have only to face the fact that people like this are out there and follow our instincts paying heed to the warning signs of bad faith using common sense in deciding whom to trust and believe for the good news about predators is that when they see youre suspicious they head off in search of easy prey you know that sucker they say is born every minute
2602686 the purpose of this website blog and book is to help the average person understand a mental illness about which little has been written for a general audience it describes and explains malignant narcissism in plain english with everyday examples in a way that is clear and meaningful to the average person you will find many examples of narcissistic behaviors and learn why people with narcissistic personality disorder act the way they do

2602730 i am not talking about players who belong to other clubs
2602731 what is clear is there are a lot of right backs currently available we have had a lot of calls as a result of luke moving on however under shrewd manager arsene wenger who has been at the helm since 1996 the gunners have maintained their big three status the frenchman is the clubs longest serving manager in terms of matches as well as being the clubs most successful coach in 2007 08 arsenal finished third in the premiership but the gunners have championed the premiership a total of three times the clubs home ground is the emirates stadium in north london having moved from their highbury home in 2006 which has a capacity of over 60 000 prominent players in the squad for 2008 09 season include emmanuel adebayor manuel almunia cesc f bregas and william gallas while players like thiery henry patrick viera david seaman and ian wright are among a long list of heroes from the past

2602776 the best support in the world for a rupture is the human hand
2602777 it is obvious that there has been a strong swing against the government
2602778 i have listened to that swing i will listen to what territorians said i take responsibility for the campaign
2602779 i believe in the principles that sit behind this side of politics
2602780 we rest on principles good principles and those principles when followed through can and will make a huge difference

2602785 if tsvangirai is indeed prime minister then mugabes position would be largely ceremonial
2602786 its a way of easing him out without him losing face and tsvangirai will in fact hold the reigns
2602787 i dispute whether any members of zanu pf should be in any kind of transitional government not a single one of them have walked away from this without blood on their hands

2602789 perhaps he has achieved much more than any of us thought that he could
2602790 bryan is starting to think about possibly getting his career started somewhere else

2602793 that win at sonoma wasnt easy at all once the green flag falls youve just got to stick to your strategy and hope everything works out in your favour
2602794 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got
2602795 whether we win or whether we run out of gas just doesnt matter at this point weve got to win
2602796 its important especially for the first two or three races of the chase when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at
2602797 it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2602798 weve got to get at least two weeks in a row to get good finishes to solidify our place its not like were getting caught up in wrecks its just dumb stuff that we get caught up in were inconsistent right now we run top 10 and then run in the 40s
2602799 right now i feel like theres five races left we can have no more than two bad races
2602800 if we finish 25th or worse were going to have to have some help
2602801 the first 30 laps everybody is pretty reasonable with blocks and being considerate on track
2602802 its a little more intense after that last pit stop on then youll have bill elliott run you into the grass everybody just fights for that space it gets really intense you have to run so hard
2602803 if we can maintain the track position all day that is really going to be the key

2602808 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2602809 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean

2602818 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2602819 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2602820 he is a normal person and has never been spoken to about anything like this before

2602827 said lomaia georgian officials also claim that russia has mobilized its black sea fleet off the coast of abkhazia another breakaway georgian province
2602828 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are a crime of course primarily a crime against their own people this aggression led to numerous casualties among civilians in particular and virtually caused a real humanitarian catastrophe and that is already a crime against the ossetian people at the same time i would like to stress that georgia has always been greatly respected in russia and georgians regarded as brotherly people
2602829 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done
2602830 the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers

2602837 we want to see guys do what we ask them to do we want to see guys play with full speed run hard to the ball on defense and execute on offense
2602838 this is the time to go ones against ones maybe the next scrimmage about half and half and then the next scrimmage you scout it up and go one versus two

2602848 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2602849 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2602850 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2602851 wanna get big watery shiny eyes without any surgery crave and envy no more
2602852 his real name is plato socrates surname but we all call him bubba
2602853 and on the way home i thanked god that im not on a diet right now so i could enjoy each bite
2602854 this would have been so much simpler with traditional paper charts

2602856 is there someone else there let me talk to them
2602857 no hes never wanted it if it were me the answer would be yes but for him hes always said no so no

2602859 explicitly promoted a specific healthcare product providing images descriptions or advocacy
2602860 included sufficient information for patients to identify their doctors or themselves
2602861 also risk exposing the public to unprofessional content and tone privacy violations and hidden promotions that damage the integrity of the medical field
2602862 you are a former crack addict and you are a reporter for the new york times which of these two do you think is more damaging to society
2602863 journalism if its practiced appropriately is a civic good using crack cocaine is an idiotic activity that will eventually result in mania and death
2602864 all those diabetics are juts fat and lazy theyd be fine if they got of their asses and moved some

2602868 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2602869 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2602870 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2602871 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2602872 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on non use of force with south ossetians
2602873 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2602874 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2602875 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2602876 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2602877 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2602878 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2602879 for years our readers have always reacted to our annual top 100 this is every gamers chance to tell us their opinion and to tell the whole world what the best pc games ever are with our american colleagues we urge pc gamers to take five minutes to vote and help us give the pc gaming world a voice
2602880 the nature of his injuries were such that in spite of their efforts his life could not be saved
2602881 no matter where he worked or who he worked with he just fit in well with everybody
2602882 he was a very outgoing likeable man and will be missed
2602883 we at the second battalion now focus our efforts on ensuring he is laid to rest with the honour and dignity he deserves
2602884 there was a civilian convoy in the vicinity and the incident will be investigated
2602885 the death of roberts is being investigated and until we have conclusive results of the investigation i cant give you a definitive statement
2602886 private contractors routinely operate within the battle space and they provide essential security to a lot of development and stabilization groups
2602887 i dont know whether they had a legitimate target or not
2602888 theres going to be an investigation into all of this activity
2602889 we are deeply affected by this loss josh will be greatly missed by his military family
2602890 as task force commander i offer my deepest condolences to the members of joshs family to his fiancee and to his friends and colleagues know that we stand with you in your grief and we will do all we can to help you through the difficult days ahead
2602891 but there was a tim hortons so it was all good
2602892 josh had a good ear he was a good listener

2602894 a no nonsense kind of guy who lived like people dreamed
2602895 he was a fun loving and genuine individual who was totally dedicated to the army and held his section together he looked out for his guys in ways they probably didnt realize
2602896 matters in which christians can have completely different opinion without effect on their faith
2602897 matters in which you do not need to be christian to agree or disagree
2602898 we dont want those christians to show their faces around here
2602899 oh wed better stay out of politics as much as possible lest we give christians a bad name by supporting something that people think has turned out badly
2602900 these are my opinions as a citizen not part of my religious convictions
2602901 christians as private citizens can and should promote all causes they believe in and it should be foolish to blame christianity if they choose wrong but the problem is when they make an issue of their christianity in advocating it any christian can support a boondoggle and that means only that he does not have much sound judgement
2602902 dont associate me with that dreadful cal thomas just because were both christians
2602903 some views that arent consequentialist are absolutist i e they insist that if anything is wrong it will always be wrong under any circumstances
2602904 whatever kant has in mind when he says that lying is always wrong breaking promises is always wrong etc
2602905 the woman is a very sick minor the victim of rape and the child will be severy damaged etc etc a real exceptional case

2602928 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2602929 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2602930 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2602931 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2602932 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2602933 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2602934 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2602935 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2602936 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2602937 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2602938 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2602939 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2602940 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2602941 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2602942 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2602943 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2602944 there could be a signing tomorrow after the leaders have met to thrash out the remaining issues
2602945 i think quite a number of western countries will want time to assess and review the outcome before committing themselves and will not simply listen to zanu pf or the mdcs versions of events
2602946 if they come on board and give the process a chance that will be good for the economy but if they dont zimbabwe will still face problems internationally
2602947 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2602948 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2602949 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2602950 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2602951 hola disculpa vos no me conoces pero estoy buscando a ricardo es muy importante

2602966 reflected my flat mate when we discussed the movie anarchy and freedom still cohabitate in congo definitely
2602967 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
2602968 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
2602969 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
2602970 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
2602971 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo
2602972 because we the congolese we want peace we are tired of this foreign sponsored war and instability
2602973 the temptation to quit will be greatest just before you are about to succeed
2602974 well robert if it doesnt work they cant eat you
2602975 a good plan violently executed today is far and away better than a perfect plan tomorrow
2602976 you never succeed in technology business or anything by following the others

2602978 lloyd was charged by singapore authorities with trafficking in and possession of a controlled drug
2602979 the journalist is alleged to have given a packet of crystalline substance believed to contain methamphetamine to a man named sani saidi 31 in return for 100 at a singapore hotel on july 9
2602980 colleagues say suspicions are emerging that saidi had implicated lloyd in exchange for a lesser charge
2602981 between five and 20 years in jail plus five to 15 strokes of the cane
2602982 i make my way to my cell close the door and wipe a tear from my cheek no matter how much good happens it never makes up for breaking a childs heart it never evens out

2602984 we were just sitting here watching all the smoke pouring up from number 7 we really couldnt see much damage on it i turned in time to see what looked like a skyscraper implosion it looked like it had been done by a demolition crew thats number 1 number 2 and now number 7 that have come down from this explosion and folks just simply cant believe it i just never for the life of me imagined that these huge buildings would just fall and thats what happened they just crumbled

2602994 by the time it got to dinner he was always pissed full and wanted a hot meal about as much as the rest of us wanted to perform cunnilingus on our grandmother
2602995 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2602996 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2602997 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2602998 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2602999 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2603000 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2603001 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2603002 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2603003 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2603004 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
2603005 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
2603006 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
2603007 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
2603008 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly

2603030 it was a bit fortunate that falkirk missed the penalty
2603031 after the events of the last few days it was important that we got three points although i think the level of criticism has been harsh we have built up a good reputation over the last 18 months and everyone has changed their opinion because of two games in europe
2603032 im pleased with the players other than those two minutes were a stronger team darren moore has come in to give some strength to the back four well be a better team this season so youve not seen the best of us yet
2603033 the states interest in universal education is not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on other fundamental rights such as those specifically protected by the free exercise clause of the first amendment and the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their children
2603034 the trial testimony showed that respondents believed in accordance with the tenets of old order amish communitites generally that their childrens attendance at high school public or private was contrary to the amish religion and way of life
2603035 as a result of their common heritage old order amish communities today are characterized by a fundamental belief that salvation requires life in a church community separate and apart from the world and worldly influence this concept of life aloof from the world and its values is central to their faith
2603036 amish objection to formal education beyond the eighth grade is firmly grounded in these central religious concepts
2603037 we must be careful to determine whether the amish religious faith and their mode of life are as they claim inseparable and interdependent a way of life however virtuous and admirable may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable state regulation of education if it is based on purely secular considerations to have the protection of the religiion clauses the claims must be rooted in religious belief
2603038 dr john a hostetler testified that compulsory high school attendance could not only result in great psychological harm to amish children because of the conflicts it would produce but would also in his opinion ultimately result in the destruction of the old order amish church community as it exists in the united states today
2603039 formal high school education beyond the eighth grade is contrary to amish beliefs not only because it places amish children in an environment hostile to amish beliefs with increasing emphasis on competition in classwork and sports and with pressure to conform to the styles manners and ways of the peer group but also because it takes them away from their community physically and emotionally during the crucial and formative adolescent period of life
2603040 in short high school attendance interposes a serious barrier to the integration of the amish child into the amish religious community
2603041 the conclusion is inescapable that secondary schooling by exposing amish children to worldly influences in terms of attitudes goals and values contrary to beliefs and by substantially interfering with the religious development of the amish child and his integration into the way of life of the amish faith community at the crucial adolescent stage of development contravenes the basic religious tenets and practice of the amish faith both as to the parent and the child
2603042 the amish in this case have convincingly demonstrated the sincerity of their religious beliefs the interrelationship of belief with their mode of life and the hazards presented by the states enforcement of a statute generally valid as to others
2603043 in sum the unchallenged testimony of acknowledged experts in education and religious history support the claim that enforcement of the states requirement of compulsory education after the eighth grade would gravely endanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents religious beliefs
2603044 its i e the states ed position is that the states interest in universal compulsory formal secondary education to age 16 is so great that it is paramount to the undisputed claims of respondents that their mode of preparing their youth for amish life after the traditional elementary education is an essential part of their religious belief and practice
2603045 a regulation neutral on its face may in its application nonetheless offend the constitutional requirement for governmental neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion
2603046 the religious scruples of the amish are opposed to the education of their children beyond the eighth grade
2603047 the courts conclusion that the matter is within the dispensation of parents alone
2603048 crucial however are the views of the child whose parent is the subject of the suit frieda yoder has in fact testified that her own religious views are opposed to high school education i therefore join the judgement of the court as to respondent jonas yoder but frieda yoders views views may not be those of vernon yutzy or barbara miller i must dissent therefore as to respondents adin yutzy and wallace miller
2603049 if the amish asserted their claims because of their subjective evaluation and rejection of the contemporary secular values accepted by the majority much as rejected the social values of his time their claims would not rest on a religious basis thoreaus choice was philosophical and personal rather than religious and such belief does not rise to the demands of the religion clauses

2603051 initially we were informed that the lightning had melted the transformer cables and they would need to be replaced at daylight however upon further inspection our facilities main transformer which was struck by lightning exploded and produced loss of power from con ed and at the same time disabling our generators
2603052 we are in the process of having a new transformer craned onto our facilitys roof and at the same time installing a redundant transformer if another act of god should happen in the future this has been the longest outage in galaxyvisions history
2603053 cinque viaggiatori stanchi che vorrebbero alloggiare nella locanda e non in campagna con i banditi
2603054 allora fattevi avanti tranquillamente alla luce poich pi amichevole guardarsi in faccia che non parlarsi dal buio
2603055 e suppongo avete dei nomi niente in contrario a dirlo alle persone da cui si va in amicizia vero
2603056 a dire il vero mai visto un nano vita mia
2603057 siamo stati attaccati da un gruppo di banditi poco prima del tramonto
2603058 mia signora perch non vi siete presentata non vi avremo certo fatta aspettare
2603059 se lo desidera tenente posso rispondere io ad eventuali domande
2603060 purtroppo ultimamente c un gruppo di briganti che sanno pesare la loro presenza da queste parti ed i loro successi hanno incoraggiato altri a seguire il loro esempio
2603061 ma questi avevano un mago o uno stregone con loro
2603062 uno stregone sicuro voglio dire non era uno che faceva finta o trucchi
2603063 bhe se i suoi erano trucchi li ha pagati costosamente purtroppo per questo raeghis anche un membro del nostro gruppo ha delle nozioni di arti arcane ed il confronto stato a dire poco unilaterale
2603064 comunque potete trovare i corpi ad alcune miglia da qui oltre a quel gruppo di casupole che vede laggi dove la strada stretta su entrambi i lati da pendici di terra ed alberi
2603065 una ben strana notizia quella che mi porta raeghis il nome del mago del gruppo che ci sta dando cosi tanti grattacapi se fosse vero sarebbe una benedizione per noi e per tutti gli insediamenti nei dintorni
2603066 vi dispiace se vi chiedo di non andarvene prima che abbia mandato qualcuno a dare un occhiata
2603067 noi prima dellalba non abbiamo nessunintenzione di muoverci dalla locanda
2603068 vi chiederei di aspettare oltre quellora non posso mandare qualcuno di notte non vedrebbe niente
2603069 sta forse ordinando alla figlia del suo signore ed alla sua scorta di aspettare il suo buon volere
2603070 una richiesta la mia ma mi sembra strano che la mia signora viaggi con altri che i suoi famigliari o mastro connery
2603071 controlli pure se tanto le fa piacere ma se la signorina desidera andare noi andremo
2603072 tanto non sarebbe la prima volta che i maclean mi degradano solo per avere fatto il mio dovere

2603292 should mama turn out the light and we can cuddle on the floor
2603293 the centre is accredited and were the only university that has a licence from the ministry of higher education to use e learning and blended technology in teaching
2603294 from 2003 there were only 19 courses active on blackboard now there are 250 courses on blackboard out of a total of around 450 we have around 4000 students regularly using blackboard the number of staff is around 200
2603295 when people think of telecom or service providers in kuwait the first name that should pop into their heads is fasttelco for us to achieve that we have to go the extra mile in providing extensive customer support and service something that is not known in the region
2603296 we have grown quite a bit over the last few years the last year the average growth rate has been 25 across consumer and corporate segments this is significant taking into consideration the competition in the kuwait market
2603297 according to the last study we did we have around 45 to 50 of the market share in the consumer broadband sector and a similar number for the corporate business we need to still increase that our objective is that when anyone thinks of data communications business grade telephony and managed services fasttelco should be the first choice
2603298 we started around eight years ago and we have been running on an optical network that runs throughout kuwait we own around 60 of the fibre underground last year we invested over us 2 million in a new network infrastructure and basically that includes everything from the transport layer through the mpls layer all the way up to the access layer in terms of dsl ports we have also further expanded our telephony services to include a new redundant class 5 switch from ericsson
2603299 the wimax licence has made the most significant difference in terms of last mile access over the past year it is easily one of the biggest implementations we have done in the recent past and one with a significant business impact we have set up the network to extend reachability across areas in kuwait and we can state now that we offer connectivity from border to border
2603300 some of our customers needed some additional reliability and we have connected them to two different base stations that adds a tremendous amount of value in terms of increased availability to these customers
2603301 the customer only has to subscribe to the service and does not need to invest in any hardware the customer traffic is routed into our security devices and is filtered back to the customer based on pre specified criteria we have antivirus and anti spam filtering intrusion prevention and detection as well as web content filtering and we can do this whether it is hosted mail services or the customer is using his own dedicated mail service
2603302 we needed a multi tenant centralised solution that would basically take care of everything we found the perfect solution from fortinet we use their hardware platform now to deliver our services to clients
2603303 the advantage of that provision cannot be over rated if we were to implement a normal security service using conventional methods it means that i would have to dedicate a hardware or software platform for every single subscriber the only company that we have seen capable of providing such services or supervising such platforms is fortinet we carried out our evaluation and we then tested the platform thoroughly for three months before deciding to go ahead with it the implementation was completed in june last year
2603304 one of the biggest challenges we faced really is that were embarking on being one of the first global cities that will have a truly integrated smart city infrastructure
2603305 there are lots of places around the world where theyve done pockets of things bits and pieces predominantly around a legacy environment we very much have a greenfield clean sheet type of approach which is a huge challenge and this is something that is re iterated to us by international partners and vendors that theyve not come across anything else as comprehensive and as innovative as this and its a challenge for us
2603306 i dont have the luxury of looking back at site x and saying well i can cut and paste that and put it into my city thats one of the challenges really when you are breaking this new frontier in terms of a technological enablement for a community in a real estate environment
2603307 in spite of having a serious project planner such as primavera or ms project plan you are bound to miss the deadlines nine times out of ten this is because each task depends on so many different things and it is to be expected that one of these will miss the milestone you need to involve the suppliers at every step and make them realise the implications of delays
2603308 ultimately a mega project is something that is obviously larger but also in many cases more complex and the complexity is usually that there are lots of moving parts there are lots of suppliers lots of suppliers of suppliers lots of different groups even within one company and even more so through several companies
2603309 for these large city projects there is a significant effort from an it point of view and we believe in a model of utilising expertise where necessary moving wherever possible to an outsourcing situation where we can be extremely agile
2603310 because when you put in a large infrastructure like this over a time span you need different skills at different stages so outsourcing is an excellent model of bringing in the high quality relevant resources at the relevant stage of your journey in building up this infrastructure and ultimately the systems that support it to provide the environment that our users will be enjoying later on when the city is fully inhabited it isnt a predominantly outsourced only perspective of course you have a mixture of internal and outsourced skills and one of the critical things is when those people go the knowledge stays
2603311 not very many people would vote since theyre expecting the election to be held in november as scheduled
2603312 if the latest poll numbers remain the same then such and such will happen in november
2603313 making your way through the mazes of the coast range to the summit of any of the inner peaks or passes opposite san francisco in the clear springtime the grandest and most telling of all california landscapes is outspread before you at your feet lies the great central valley glowing golden in the sunshine extending north and south farther than the eye can reach one smooth flowery lake like bed of fertile soil along its eastern margin rises the mighty sierra miles in height reposing like a smooth cumulus cloud in the sunny sky and so gloriously colored and so luminous it seems to be not clothed with light but wholly composed of it like the wall of some celestial city along the top and extending a good way down you see a pale pearl gray belt of snow and below it a belt of blue and dark purple marking the extension of the forests and along the base of the range a broad belt of rose purple and yellow where lie the minors gold fields and the foot hill gardens all these colored belts blending smoothly make a wall of light ineffably fine and as beautiful as a rainbow yet firm as adamant when i first enjoyed this superb view one glowing april day from the summit of the pacheco pass the central valley but little trampled or plowed as yet was one furred rich sheet of golden compositae and the luminous wall of the mountains shone in all its glory then it seemed to me the sierra should be called not the nevada or snowy range but the range of light and after ten years spent in the heart of it rejoicing and wondering bathing in its glorious floods of light seeing the sunbursts of morning among the icy peaks the noonday radiance on the trees and rocks and snow the flush of the alpenglow and a thousand dashing waterfalls with their marvelous abundance of irised spray it still seems to me above all others the range of light the most divinely beautiful of all the mountain chains i have ever seen

2603325 the location of the altar in the holy temple is very exactly defined it is a commonly held tradition that the place where david and solomon built the altar on the threshing floor of arona is the very place where abraham built an altar and bound isaac upon it this is where noah built an altar when he came out from the ark this is where cain and abel brought their offerings this is where adam the first man offered a korban when he was created and it is from the earth of this place that he was created

2603551 is to enable man to be once more himself restored to his right mind and his right place as a creature under god the christian life is the life of man male and female made in the image of god and after his likeness to deny this humanity and attempt to reach beyond to a spirituality which somehow contradicts it is to fall prey once more to the tempter in his shining specious livery who as an angel of light beckons us to reach beyond the confines of our human existence to a place where in fact we deny it and fall from its dignity

2603689 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

2603697 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
2603698 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
2603699 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados

2603708 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo
2603709 dejamos claro que no es tozudez de parte nuestra sino de los que provocan por cuanto anteriormente hab amos invitado a la autoridad comunal y gobierno regional a conversar en el espacio ceremonial rewe weicha el d a s bado 2 de agosto a las 13 00 horas no acudiendo ninguna de las autoridades mencionadas

2603712 sarcelles where the opening murder takes place was another a ghetto with its own violent rules of dog eat dog that had little or nothing to do with the laws of the republic these places were viewed by most people as the price that france had been made to pay for her imperial misadventures

2603731 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the futur e
2603732 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2603733 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2603734 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on nonuse of force with south ossetians
2603735 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2603736 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2603737 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2603738 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2603739 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2603740 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2603741 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2603742 you have to realise i have come into a new club where there are a lot of things different to what i am used to
2603743 it takes time to get the place running how i want it to its early days but these things will get sorted out quickly and we will move on
2603744 i was at blackburn for four years and i knew exactly how things were done the lines of communication what have you at the moment its not quite as it was at blackburn
2603745 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2603746 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2603747 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2603748 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2603749 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
2603750 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines
2603751 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital

2603753 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2603754 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2603755 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2603756 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2603757 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2603758 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2603759 the size of organisms tends to be constrained by a scaling principle scientists call surface to volume ratio
2603760 as the organism grows this surface to volume ratio declines in a way this is how nature keeps the sizes of various species in check
2603761 the average size of the prey captured by the colony increased 20 fold as colony size increased from less than 100 to 10 000 spiders
2603762 so even though the number of prey falls sharply as the colony grows the biomass that individual spiders acquire actually increases
2603763 there simply arent enough large insects in those areas to sustain this type of foraging behaviour
2603764 while national treatment recommendations have focused on aggressive management of ldl c levels mainly through statin therapy we have found little change in hdl c levels and an actual increase in triglyceride levels
2603765 this is not good news as these factors are important components of cardiovascular risk
2603766 the study of marine mammal acoustics and behavior is an area of emerging interest for many reasons but there have been many recent advances including this recently completed study
2603767 we were fortunate to have some of the best scientists in these fields working with noaa on this pilot project it will take some time to analyze the data and see what conclusions may be drawn but in many ways this effort lays the foundation for more sophisticated collaborative efforts in the future
2603768 theres a lot of misinformation so thats why this study is so important
2603769 hundreds and hundreds of parents think this works but we need serious evidence
2603770 a lot of children with autism have gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea whether these problems are related to brain development is open to question
2603771 there are neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors in the gut that correspond with those in the brain there are some scientific reasons to think that some kids may benefit from this diet
2603772 brown carbon spheres in east asian outflow and their optical properties
2603773 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
2603774 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
2603775 if we know the optical properties and distribution of all the aerosols over the entire atmosphere then we can produce climate change models that provide more accurate prediction
2603776 the problem with this approach is that it gives the average properties of all aerosol components and at only a few wavelengths of light
2603777 we have used this approach to determine the complete optical properties of individual brown carbon nanoparticles sampled from above the yellow sea during a large international climate change experiment
2603778 this is the first time anyone has determined the complete optical properties of single nanoparticles from the atmosphere
2603779 we show that many of the carbons in our sample have optical properties that are different from those usually assumed in climate models
2603780 when you hear about predictions of future warming or changes in precipitation globally or in specific regions like the southwestern united states the predictions are based on computer model output that is ignoring brown carbon so they are going to tend to be less accurate
2603781 hackers turned computer security specialists accuse google of setting users up for online disasters by letting them personalize home pages with applications that could be tainted
2603782 but even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2603783 it helped us gather our thoughts and get us back on track
2603784 he takes the job very seriously the fans were pretty hard on us last summer and were tired of that thats not who we are and its been corrected

2603787 he really cares about the players heck when freshman kheeston randall got sick he brought him soup
2603788 you can only see 10 percent of it ninety percent of the ice is under water thats who you really are
2603789 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2603790 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2603791 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2603792 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2603793 were all proud because this is his home turf where he learned about politics and trade unions and thanks to his struggle there have been important changes
2603794 im going to vote for evo because hes always going to support us

2603814 and we in the congress should not be silent as iran sets up the mechanism to ethnically cleanse its bahai minority totaling over 250 000 human beings
2603815 it sends a strong signal that congress will continue to watch closely the treatment of the bahai people in iran
2603816 setting up an illegal organisation with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
2603817 we deny in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that bahais in iran have engaged in any subversive activity
2603818 the bahai community is not involved in political affairs their only crime is the practice of their religion
2603819 the seriousness of the allegations makes us fear for the lives of these seven individuals

2603872 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats

2603889 the continued refusal of sags negotiators to accept amptps final offer means that actors will continue to work indefinitely under the expired contract an old contract that contains none of the 250 million in additional compensation provided by amptps final offer and an old contract that provides none of the new media rights and residuals that other hollywood guild members have now been enjoying for months
2603890 to be included with cal ripken eddie murray jim palmer brooks robinson and frank robinson i dont think ive had an honor that will compare and i dont think i ever will
2603891 that was one of the great moments of my life he also gave the introduction at yesterdays luncheon obviously im prejudiced but i thought he was absolutely sensational
2603892 two my first real save in oakland and me screwing up the game in no 160 by thinking too much
2603893 the stretchy guy from fantastic four couldnt have stopped that pitch i learned a lot that night looking across the clubhouse and seeing jamie quirk saying he should have had it jamie was man enough to take the blame but it was 100 percent my fault i remembered that every time i screwed up the rest of my career and tried to follow that lead and say it was my fault
2603894 you already said that youre excused now if you dont mind
2603895 bryan is starting to think about possibly getting his career started somewhere else
2603896 well leave him alone hes going to get back to us in a couple of weeks theres not going to be any issues im really confidant its going to be resolved amicably before training camp
2603897 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
2603898 looking at these massive samples of malware we cant help but think that theres something brewing in russia
2603899 we have just seen these cyber criminals pull the italian job recently
2603900 this can be explained by the large number of mal iframe and mal obfjs infected web pages in russia that have been compromised to serve as drive by sites
2603901 this statistic underscores how the malware market has shifted from fame to fortune
2603902 bots adware spyware and other attacks make up an over 100 billion global market for cyber crime surpassing drug trafficking as a global issue from a monetary perspective
2603903 what is most worrying is that this particular sample of malware wasnt recognized by existing antivirus software it was able to slip through enterprise defenses
2603904 this is a serious threat it shows how sophisticated hackers have become
2603905 just as we see an evolution in messaging we also see an evolution in threats
2603906 as companies have gotten better blocking e mails we see people move to more creative techniques
2603907 the next logical step seems to be the media players
2603908 people are accustomed to not clicking on messages from banks but they all want to see videos from youtube
2603909 try to get ahead of emerging threats rather than having to chase them
2603910 maybe to show off or just be disruptive it doesnt seem to be extortion or anything like that
2603911 there was what appears to be some form of attack during the night hours here in california and into the morning
2603912 hey ysrail and usa dont sic kill children and other people peace for ever no war
2603913 we are very concerned that this happened and we are investigating
2603914 we will make security changes to prevent this from happening again
2603915 hacked by keremy 125 m0sted and gsy that is cyberprotest
2603916 that the powerful have no right to oppress the powerless
2603917 the chief architects of this protest are myself eno7 from turkey and the byond hackers team from chile we expanded our efforts as nine other countries joined us afterwards
2603918 it neednt be a part of the site that allows visitors to interact with it like a comments page
2603919 even in a read only section a hacker can issue a command that forces the database to issue information and when they find that vulnerability an attacker can gain full control of the site
2603920 cada uno d como propuso en su coraz n no con tristeza ni por necesidad
2603921 we obviously have redundant systems in place there will be some administrative disruptions and personal inconveniences
2603922 i dont do e mail im a very low tech person
2603923 the nature of the threat is large and diverse and includes recreational hackers self styled cyber vigilantes various groups with nationalistic or ideological agendas transnational actors and nation states
2603924 users should pressure adobe to release a patch sooner than that
2603925 it may be to steal intellectual property it may be corporate espionage it may be to get into the database
2603926 the how to tutorials out there are getting better and better and people need less and less technical skills
2603927 j cris ceci je ne peux donc qu tre cela
2603928 ok if anything changes between now and when you leave work just send me an email i has an iphone now so i can always get emails
2603929 the internet into cell phones in a very cool way
2603930 no legal authority to investigate the circumstances of your complaint
2603931 does he have the authority over any locally elected city or county official
2603932 includes omission in the performance of a duty imposed by law or clearly inherent in the nature of the office
2603933 believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality
2603934 were an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while youre studying that reality judiciously as you will well act again creating other new realities which you can study too and thats how things will sort out were historys actors and you all of you will be left to just study what we do
2603935 the governments of repressive countries are now targeting bloggers and online journalists as forcefully as journalists in the traditional media
2603936 i did not have sex with that woman well maybe i did
2603937 no ones coming in until eight and we have to get twenty weekender subs ready by seven thirty
2603938 la medicina tradicional china es responsable del sufrimiento y extinci n de muchas especies de animales
2603939 very often if there is one thing that i have learned in my thirty years in high tech is sometimes concepts are a little bit too early but when they do take off they take off with tremendous speed and efficiency
2603940 this where i think it is important especially for the business communities and the entertainment industries to understand what is possible because
2603941 i would compare it to the first stages of the internet if you look back to the predictions made by cisco and others in the early nineties and mid nineties almost all of them not only came true but ended up being even lower then we expected in terms of underestimating the market opportunity
2603942 so i think when you think about interfacing to your customers interfacing to your family interfacing to your peers and the communities of interest we will have both in our business world and our personal life i think we are at the very very beginning stages of what is possible
2603943 si se desactiva la ona ya esa es una decisi n pol tica lo que se deber a es reformar el decreto para que no haya colisi n con la ley en aquella parte donde se le encarga investigar delitos penales eso se debe reformar para evitar complicaciones de orden constitucional
2603944 kell tu tem que sair mais curtir mais a vida
2603945 hey one of your tracks would kick ass for the middle
2603946 maybe we can have a round two down the road with some pictures and more info
2603947 pablo no creas que no nos preocupamos de esto solo que en esta reuni n no tocamos ese tema

2603949 grita uka uka para que le mojon te salga con peluka
2603950 i did not want to sleep so i thought about the things that have been happening in my life
2603951 do you want to talk about anything because thats what friends are for
2603952 if you want to listen i will talk my problem is that i have made so many friends and a great deal of them are mortals aragorn is gone now and gimli will also be gone someday i fear that i still do not completely understand death
2603953 in a way i understand how you feel and in a way i do not
2603954 but i still think that in a way aragorn is still with us although we cannot see him it is just the way that i see it
2603955 you have never really made a mortal friend have you
2603956 no the only mortal friend that i have had is my horse if you think that counts as a mortal friend
2603957 well i have been friends with aragorn since long before and after the war of the ring and it is a great blow to realize that he is now dead
2603958 why have you not returned to mirkwood after all these years
2603959 i would really prefer not to talk about it right now if that is alright
2603960 that is alright and i am sorry for asking so abruptly
2603961 it is just the fact that i have not seen you in a long while and you are one of my childhood friends when sairahiniel told me that you had left mirkwood and had not come back i feared that something had happened to you
2603962 i simply wanted to explore middle earth before everyone left for valinor i was surprised to see that you were still here
2603963 i wanted to stay and help aragorn rebuild middle earth and then i was going to leave for valinor
2603964 so you do know what it is that gilrod needs from gondor
2603965 i really dont know it sounded urgent so i thought that i would show him the way to minas tirith
2603966 well if i did not trust gilrod you know that i would say that it was not wise leading him to gondor however i think you made the right choice
2603967 well i am glad that you feel that way because i dont regret leading gilrod to gondor and doubt that i ever will
2603968 i have not felt better since i first started out on my journey i actually slept well for a change
2603969 do you think eldarion is ready to hear what gilrod has to say
2603970 i think so unless he is still clearing up some things you two should go ask him
2603971 i have been awake listening to you and the she elf
2603972 yes there was a small group of four that we were in there was my sister sairahiniel amrir a son of one of my fathers servants randiriel daughter of honedain my fathers chief advisor and i we were all best friends in our younger years and we got into much mischief together
2603973 i know i said something that sounded like i did not trust her judgment concerning bringing strangers to minas tirith i probably should have bit my tongue and kept quiet
2603974 aye it is hard to control the tongue when there is a beautiful young she elf in front of you is it not
2603975 legolas do not not think i could not see the expression on your face when you saw her riding up to us you froze like you had been struck by lightning
2603976 gimli i was simply surprised to see her after all these years she left mirkwood 338 years ago and had not been seen since it was a shock to see her because i had believed she was dead
2603977 now if we wish to hear why gilrod has come to minas tirith then we had best be going
2603978 well i will put it this way my people the inatrans are at war with another country that is called miltra which used to be a sister country of inatra my father sent me off to finnd assistance for he fears that they will be ready to attack our bordering towns very soon
2603979 gilrod why did you not tell me that your people were in danger
2603980 tell us who these men are that seek to attack your people
2603981 well these men are called draugians and they have been our ememies since we first came to inatra and miltra long ago they chased us out of miltra and they almost suceeded in taking inatra as well what helped us keep inatra was our knife of power jenadar whoever held this knife had the power to defend against any army attack and always walk away victorious what gave jenadar its power of victory was the small stone embedded in its sheath the reason that we cannot defeat the draugians is the fact that jenadar has been missing for many years before i was born all of our people have searched for jenadar many years but to no avail for all those years of searchng we managed to keep the draugians from finding out that we lost our power but now they finally know our secret
2603982 these men are around a foot taller than i and they are expert warriors we have the skill in war to match theirs but we do not have as many men as they have in their army when my father found that the draugians were organizing an attack on inatra he sent me to find help and i found you will you not help us save our country
2603983 i am sorry about jenadar and i do not know how i might help in that area but i can send some men to your country from which direction did you come to reach us
2603984 i came from the west and my boat is still over where i hid it waiting for me to go back to inatra
2603985 that is where all our people have gone to valinor
2603986 no my boat is west of here i simply sailed around and i happened to land there so i decided here would be as good a place as any to look for help
2603987 alright then i shall send some of my men to inatra to assist you but it may take some time to get them together why dont you go back to inatra and tell your father of the help that you have found and that an army is coming close behind you
2603988 eldarion if i may say something i think it would be wise for randiriel gimli and i to go with gilrod and learn the way to his country and once we reach inatra gimli and i can come back and lead the army to their destination
2603989 that is a good idea legolas i think that would be very good if you three would lead the men to inatra it would be a great help
2603990 tomorrow you have not even been here a day you should rest a while longer before you travel back home
2603991 i cannot rest until i know that my people are accounted for one more night should be all that i need to refresh myself
2603992 well then i should be getting ready to depart then
2603993 go on and get ready for the trip and i sincerely hope all goes well that you will defeat the draugians and that you will get miltra back in your possesion
2603994 i thought that maybe gilrod could use our help saving his country so that is why i volunteered to follow gilrod to inatra and then come back and lead the army to where they need to go
2603995 so you are saying that this has absolutely nothing to do with a certain she elf
2603996 i believe that i should go down and see how belendi is faring at the kings stable no doubt she is enjoying herself
2603997 dont think for one minute that i did not see your head over in that stall but dont worry i think he is very handsome
2603998 her name is belendi gandalf gave her to me before he left for valinor
2603999 gandalf gave her to you she must be the young horse that shadowfax sired then
2604000 i have not seen another horse with a black and white coat like hers she is very unique
2604001 it seems as if we cannot keep from meeting each other
2604002 i just came to check on my horse just as you did
2604003 he is called forodasul because he is one of the fastest horses in my country not many have ever been able to beat him in a race
2604004 i think you had better leave racing to the other horses mellon nin
2604005 if you both did race i can already make a bet that young belendi would win she was sired by shadowfax the fastest horse ever to set foot in middle earth the likes of which i most likely shall never lay eyes on again
2604006 well it was nice speaking with you both but i had better be heading back now
2604007 yes she spent most of her time with my sister and i when we were children she is the daughter of honedain my fathers chief advisor
2604008 your fathers chief advisor your father is a king then
2604009 yes he is the king of the wood elves of mirkwood why do you ask
2604010 well that makes us both princes my father is the king of inatra as yours is the king of mirkwood
2604011 i had better leave now but i shall see you tomorrow when we leave
2604012 well my young friend we have been riding steadily for hours
2604013 if you at any time feel like you need to rest just let me know
2604014 belendi you know very well i did not mean that we could stop now i said we stop when you need to
2604015 alright i will make a deal with you since i do not have to be at any certain place anytime soon as soon as we get to that little grove of trees that is about five miles ahead we may stop
2604016 when you want something you certainly can run very fast
2604017 we stopped two hours ago so you could not possibly be that thirsty
2604018 belendi you are the worst prankster i have ever met you should know by now that i am immortal you cannot drown me
2604019 i think we can trust this man belendi so dont worry
2604020 by any chance would you happen to know where the king of this country dwells
2604021 yes the king lives in the realm of gondor but gondor is a long way from here four days ride at least
2604022 oh my i have already been riding for a week
2604023 i can tell that you have traveled a long way you look tired why dont you get down and rest awhile
2604024 why thank you i believe that i will accept your invitation
2604025 no my horse just decided to shake water all over me thats all
2604026 ah i see horses can be mighty playful can they not
2604027 well randiriel i have a request to ask of you
2604028 since your king dwells at least four days ride away i was wondering if you would be willing to guide me to gondor seeing as i am not too familiar with this land
2604029 i dont see why i cant because i dont have much else to do that is more important
2604030 your horse is very fast to reply when you call for her
2604031 yes she is just like her father the only differences between them is their markings and the fact that belendi can communicate with me without words
2604032 just so you know gilrod the king i am taking you to is not the king of my people he is the king of the men of middle earth
2604033 well if he is the king over the race of men in this country then what race are you from
2604034 then the tales that i have heard of elves must be true is it correct for me to say that you elves are immortal and can only be killed in battle or die of a broken heart
2604035 then if you are immortal how old would that make you
2604036 it is not too amazing for i am among a younger generation of elves our queen galadriel is over the 8000 year mark
2604037 that is still amazing i have heard tell of your people ever since i was just a youngster i began to think that the stories were just a bunch of tall tales now however it has been proved otherwise
2604038 well i am one of the first and last elves you shell ever see
2604039 i am one of the last elves left in middle earth nowadays almost all of my people have gone on to the undying lands over the sea
2604040 i felt that there were many more wonderful things to be discovered in middle earth before i left for good so i decided to stay until i had explored as much as i could here
2604041 no i dont think so i still have to explore the land in the west past my homeland of mirkwood
2604042 am i keeping you from your travels by asking you to show me the way to gondor
2604043 of course not i have plenty more years left to live so i have all the more time to explore
2604044 oh alright are you absolutely certain that i am not hindering you in any way
2604045 now i have told you about me how about you tell me something of yourself
2604046 alright i am gilrod the eldest of the children of airion king of inatra
2604047 if you are a prince then why are you riding here in middle earth so far away from your homeland
2604048 i am here because my father sent me on a secret mission which i am not supposed to speak of until i meet with the king
2604049 then what exactly is inatra the country that you are the prince of
2604050 i am not sure that i have ever heard of it
2604051 i am sure you have not heard of inatra few have except for those who live there we inatrans rarely leave our country for we are a very timid and cautious people
2604052 no i cant be because this mission requires for me not to be however i am very cautious about who i talk to you seem very trustworthy so i have no problems speaking with you
2604053 do you think that we should go and ask him or her if we are headed in the right direction
2604054 i believe that we are headed the right way but if you wish that we ask we shall
2604055 there are two people on that horse unless my eyes fool me
2604056 the small stout one is a dwarf and the other looks like an elf
2604057 why on earth would an elf be riding with a dwarf that is a thing unheard of
2604058 we just wanted to make sure that we were on the right track towards gondor
2604059 yes you are in fact that is where we are headed right now
2604060 what is the reason that you both are headed to gondor
2604061 gilrod here has a serious matter that needs discussing with the king
2604062 did you not hear the news the king is very ill and will soon be dead
2604063 it seems like just yesterday that he took the throne
2604064 that is the one problem with being immortal time goes by so fast that you barely have time to realize that it was there
2604065 well what do i do now i have nowhere else to go
2604066 you both should come along with gimli and i aragorns son eldarion will most likely help you
2604067 that is very kind of you i believe that we will accept your invitation
2604068 legolas i am afraid that you got here too late
2604069 who are your friends legolas and gimli you have not introduced us
2604070 i am sorry that we did not mention them before
2604071 this is randiriel one of the young elves that i spent most of my childhood with and this is her friend gilrod he has an urgent matter of utmost importance and we advised him to come to gondor for help
2604072 i am flattered that you would come to us for help but i am afraid that we cant do much until my fathers burial has taken place this evening
2604073 would you mind telling us about your problem tomorrow morning after you have had a good nights rest
2604074 of course i wouldnt mind i understand how you feel i would feel the same if i had just lost my father
2604075 you all should go and get some rest and i do not care what you say legolas thranduilion you will rest tonight
2604076 gimli and i usually have the pick of these rooms when we come here because these are reserved for aragorn and arwens personal friends
2604077 sorry to bother you randiriel but did you want to come to aragorns burial with us or would you prefer to stay here
2604078 i think that i had better refrain from bothering aragorns family and friends in their time of mourning
2604079 if i am needed for anything though i shall come with you and give whatever assistance that is needed
2604080 i suppose we shall see you in the morning then good night
2604081 las autoridades georgianas respaldan una tregua y la separaci n de las partes en conflicto
2604082 mereka telah berjanji dan bersetuju jika perkara sebegini hendak dibincangkan kena buat secara tertutup tetapi malangnya janji ini telah diketepikan
2604083 sebab itu hari ini majlis peguam membincangkan tentang pengislaman mereka tahu ini sensitif dan tidak harus dibincangkan secara terbuka tetapi demikian lemahnya kerajaan maka tiada apa apa tindakan diambil terhadap mereka
2604084 tapi sekarang bila orang melayu nampak lemah mereka kecam dan abaikan perjanjian berkenaan
2604085 the new forum will provide much needed information to the
2604086 it seems like only recently but it has been two years since we launched codeplex
2604087 we launched this in summer 2006 as microsofts open source project hosting site our goal was and continues to be to provide developers with the ability to collaborate on open source projects using the tools they are most familiar with
2604088 recently achieving two major milestones 1 000 000 unique visitors month and 5 000 total projects codeplex projects appeal to many audiences and include the ajax control toolkit rawr a net tool for world of warcraft and ironpython
2604089 to give you a glimpse into some of the technology behind the site codeplex is built on team foundation server tfs specifically seven tfs servers run more than 5 600 projects and cater to 12 000 project developers and 120 000 code check ins
2604090 why not publish the full open source of visual foxpro instead of the smoke and mirrors nonsense of sedna or the source for visual basic microsoft and open source is like using rapid application development and visual studio in the same sentence
2604091 the best thing that ever happened to the network operator crowd
2604092 the worst thing that ever happened to applications and content
2604093 this is a false choice one most providers dont even consider necessary or practical these scare tactics shouldnt deter anyone from pursuing the policies we need to preserve a free and open internet
2604094 but to believe such a move is right around the corner we must accept the argument that there is congestion in the network
2604095 predicting the internets catastrophic collapse and ghost sites galore in 1996
2604096 almost all of the many predictions now being made about 1996 hinge on the internets continuing exponential growth but i predict the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse
2604097 isps may well buck the historical trends and economic incentives and move forward with limitation pricing anyway
2604098 cable isps may be particularly worried about the threat that online video poses to their own video products and might turn to limitation pricing as a way of disfavoring services like netflix appletv vudu hulu vuze miro and a whole host of commercial online video distribution applications
2604099 we want to dramatically simplify the process of buying and selling ads online

2604102 he wasnt going to be on our team so it doesnt matter to me hes not in our division not in our conference well see him in the preseason a little bit if not maybe the super bowl
2604103 now therell probably be less media in our locker room itll probably be better for us
2604104 i just dont think that him leaving the packers and going to the jets was a great thing because you never know with them
2604105 hes a great quarterback i just dont know if that was a smooth idea im not saying hes going to do something bad but i think he had a pretty good thing with the packers
2604106 our offensive line we talked and wed be happy to take brett out and show him all the fine restaurants
2604107 all hed have to do is pay for the bill
2604108 its quite a warm welcome but i think everyone knows that in new york that doesnt last long
2604109 he got the broadway sign hes in the paper every day so now they have to deal with it
2604110 i think hes going to realize that the media is a little different from green bay hes not going to control it
2604111 they think he is making progress and hes excited about it
2604112 i think his running has increased and hopefully well get something done here
2604113 we had some decent intensity on defense not as much as i would like on offense
2604114 thats where we are thats where we have to improve
2604115 but i think we have to turn it up a notch
2604116 ive been a software engineer my whole life and im looking for something new
2604117 if amateurs can help make biological engineering more reliable i certainly would find that of value
2604118 i would think that amateurs would prefer to experiment with organisms that can be more readily inspected without expensive instruments
2604119 forget e coli theyre too microscopic how about a plant like moss
2604120 is biological engineering fundamentally more dangerous than the risks posed by other fields such as mechanical engineering
2604121 avea si corina excentricitatile ei nu voia sa mearga nicaieri decat daca vizitele erau scurte si daca putea sa vina si sa plece cand voia niciodata nu statea pana la sfarsitul unei cine ci sosea cand lumea era la masa manca o punga de dulciuri in timp ce se plimba prin camera ridica diverse obiecte si cerea amanunte despre provenienta lor dupa care la vreo jumatate de ora ma tragea sa plecam de acolo cu dorinta subita de a merge la o alta petrecere ca sa stam de vorba cu cineva care era expert in design vestimentar
2604122 the obama campaign has such a strong network of its own grass roots people
2604123 even if the county democratic party operation is not as effective because of the investigation its not going to affect us very much
2604124 cuyahoga county employees working on political party business during normal business hours
2604125 i know in my heart that ive done nothing wrong to warrant this kind of an investigation
2604126 i am absolutely confident that when the dust clears my good name and reputation will also be cleared
2604127 when theres a federal investigation under way friends and acquaintances scatter
2604128 kerry won big in cuyahoga county but it wasnt enough
2604129 both jimmy and frank have their loyal networks with hundreds of people who are beholden to them who are on the public payroll

2604162 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got
2604163 whether we win or whether we run out of gas just doesnt matter at this point weve got to win
2604164 its important especially for the first two or three races of the chase when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at
2604165 it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2604166 weve got to get at least two weeks in a row to get good finishes to solidify our place its not like were getting caught up in wrecks its just dumb stuff that we get caught up in were inconsistent right now we run top 10 and then run in the 40s

2604169 the first 30 laps everybody is pretty reasonable with blocks and being considerate on track

2604177 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2604178 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2604180 the syrians said that a visit at this time was inopportune
2604181 syrias election to the board while under investigation for secretly building an undeclared nuclear reactor not suited for peaceful purposes would make a mockery
2604182 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2604185 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2604186 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2604187 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2604235 l levant la cabeza y le sonri pronunci su nombre y se puso de pie le acarici suavemente el cabello le alis las cejas con la yema del dedo y la bes en los labios con suavidad en voz alta le dijo que la amaba o temblando se dio cuenta aterrada de que le respond a te quiero y de que era verdad l la abraz diciendo vida m a la bes en el cuello y en el borde de la mejilla ella ten a la cabeza apoyada en el hombro cubierto por la t nica violeta l esta vez en voz baja le repi ti que la amaba y a adi ahora te arrodillar s me acariciar s y me be sar s cuando hubieron dirigido la luz de la l mpara de manera que cayera de lleno sobre su sexo y el rostro de su amante que estaba muy cerca y sobre sus manos que lo acariciaban por debajo ren or den bruscamente repite te quiero te quiero repiti o con tal deleite que sus labios apenas se atrev an a rozar la punta del sexo protegida todav a por su suave funda de carne los tres hombres que estaban fumando comentaban sus gestos el movimiento de su boca que se hab a ce rrado sobre el sexo y a lo largo del cual sub a y bajaba su rostro descompuesto que se inundaba de l grimas cada vez que el miembro hinchado le llegaba a la garganta oprimi ndole la lengua y pro vocando una n usea con la boca llena de aque lla carne endurecida ella volvi a murmurar te quiero las dos mujeres estaban a derecha e izquierda de ren que se apoyaba en sus hombros o o a los comentarios de los presentes pero a trav s de sus palabras espiaba los gemidos de su amante atenta a acariciarlo con un respeto infinito y la lentitud que ella sab a le gustaba o sent a que su boca era hermosa puesto que su amante se dignaba penetrar en ella se dignaba mostrar en p blico sus caricias y se dignaba en suma derramarse en ella ella lo recibi como se recibe a un dios le oy gritar oy re r a los otros y cuando lo hubo recibido se des plom de bruces las dos mujeres la levantaron y esta vez se la llevaron
2604236 las marcas se hab an hinchado y formaban unas rayas estrechas y mucho m s oscuras que la tela roja que cubr a las paredes d nde dorm a su amante como a l le gusta dormir las ma anas tranquilas en qu habitaci n en qu cama sab a a qu suplicio la hab a librado lo hab a dispuesto l o pens en esos prisioneros que se ven en los grabados de los libros de historia que tambi n hab an sido en cadenados y azotados hac a qui n sabe cu ntos a os o siglos y que hab an muerto ella no deseaba morir pero si el suplicio era el precio que ten a que pagar para que su amante siguiera am ndola no ped a m s que l estuviera contento de que ella lo hubiera sufrido y sumisa y callada esperaba que la condujeran a l
2604237 le dijo sujet ndola por el collar pasando los dedos entre la piel y la tira de cuero que en lo sucesivo se propon a compartirla con todos los afiliados a la sociedad del castillo como hab a hecho la v spera que depend a de l y s lo de l aunque recibiera rdenes de otros y aunque l no estuviera presente pues por principio l participaba en todo aquello que se le exigiera o se le infligiera y que era l quien la pose a y la gozaba a trav s de aquellos a cuyas ma nos era entregada por haber sido l quien la hab a entregado ella deb a someterse a ellos y acogerlos con el mismo respeto con que le acog a a l como otras tantas im genes suyas as l la poseer a como un dios posee a sus criaturas cuando se apodera de ellas bajo la m scara de un monstruo de un ave del esp ritu invisible o del xtasis l no quer a separarse de ella y cuanto m s la entregaba m s suya la sent a el hecho de que la entregara era para l una prueba como deb a serlo tambi n para ella de que ella le pertenec a nadie puede dar lo que no le pertenece y l la daba para recobrarla enriquecida a sus ojos como un objeto de uso co rriente que hubiera servido para un culto divino que lo hubiera consagrado hac a tiempo que deseaba prostituirla y ahora comprobaba con satisfacci n que el placer que ello le procuraba era m s grande de lo que supon a y lo ligaba a ella todav a m s como hab a de ligarla a l cuanto m s humillada y mortificada se viera y am ndolo como lo amaba ella no pod a sino amar todo aquello que viniese de l o lo escuchaba temblando de felicidad y puesto que l la amaba consent a en todo l debi adivinarlo porque entonces dijo porque te es f cil consentir quiero de ti algo que te ser imposible por m s que t lo aceptes por m s que ahora digas que s y por muy capaz que te sientas de someterte no podr s dejar de rebe larte obtendremos tu sumisi n a pesar tuyo no s lo por el incomparable placer que yo o los otros encontremos en ello sino tambi n para que t te des cuenta de lo que hemos hecho de ti
2604238 pero nada la ayudaba tanto como el silencio excepto las cadenas las cadenas y el silencio que hubieran debido atarla al fondo de s misma ahogarla estrangularla por el contra rio la liberaban qu hubiera sido de ella de ha ber podido hablar de haber podido elegir cuando su amante la prostitu a es cierto hablaba durante el suplicio pero se puede llamar palabras a lo que no son sino quejas y gritos y muchas veces la hac an callar amordaz ndola bajo las miradas las manos los miembros que la ultrajaban bajo los l ti gos que la desgarraban ella se perd a en una deliran te ausencia de s misma que la entregaba al amor y acaso la acercaba a la muerte
2604239 y lo que nosotros esperamos de usted es m s fuerte digo nosotros porque hablo tambi n en nombre de ren si en cierto modo somos hermanos yo soy el ma yor tengo diez a os m s que l entre nosotros existe una libertad tan antigua y absoluta que hace que todo lo que me pertenece sea suyo y lo que le pertenece a l sea tambi n m o consiente usted en participar en esta relaci n
2604240 cu ntas veces no estuvo ella en roissy de ro dillas en actitud parecida ofrecida a cualquiera pero entonces estaba atada por los brazaletes que le manten an las manos unidas feliz prisionera a la que todo se le impon a a la que nunca se le ped a nada aqu si permanec a semidesnuda era por su propia voluntad pues un solo movimiento el que har a para ponerse de pie bastar a para cubrirla su promesa la ataba tanto como las pulseras de cuero y las cadenas era s lo su promesa y por humillada que estuviera o precisamente porque estaba humillada no resultaba tambi n dulce pensar que era su humillaci n su obediencia su docilidad lo que hac a que no tuviera precio
2604241 t confundes el amor con la obediencia a m me obedecer s sin amarme y sin que yo te ame
2604242 o mientras le escuchaba se dec a que acaso fuera tambi n demasiado tarde para l iba a tardar tanto en reducirla que al fin acabar a por enamorar se de su obra porque toda su resistencia interior y aquella t mida negativa que se atrev a a manifestar no ten a m s motivo que ste ella quer a existir para sir stephen por poco que fuera como exist a para ren y que l sintiera por ella algo m s que deseo y no porque le quisiera sino porque se ha b a dado cuenta de que ren amaba a sir stephen con ese apasionamiento de los muchachos por el hermano mayor y estaba segura de que para dar satisfacci n a sir stephen estar a dispuesto a sa crificarla a ella intu a que calcar a su actitud sobre la de l y que si sir stephen le demostraba despre cio ren aunque la amara ser a contaminado por aquel desprecio como nunca lo estuviera ni por aso mo por la actitud de los hombres de roissy
2604243 hoy aquella oferta ten a un significado mayor en relaci n con sir stephen que en relaci n con ella lo que cada uno buscar a en ella ser a la marca del otro la huella del paso del otro
2604244 desde luego todo hubiera sido m s f cil si a sir stephen le hu bieran gustado los hombres y o estaba segura de que ren a quien tampoco le gustaban hubiera accedido apasionadamente a cualquier exigencia de sir stephen pero a sir stephen no le gustaban m s que las mujeres ella comprend a que bajo las espe cies de su cuerpo ellos dos alcanzaban algo m s misterioso y tal vez m s intenso que una relaci n amorosa una uni n cuya concepci n le era penosa pero cuya realidad y cuya fuerza no pod a negar sin embargo por qu aquella partici n era en cierto modo abstracta
2604245 el amor por el hombre que muy en el fondo l mismo quisiera ser
2604246 en sir stephen en contr al amo severo que l no sab a ser el que el hombre al que m s admiraba en el mundo se com placiera en ella y se tomara la molestia de pon r sela d cil acrecentaba la pasi n que ren sent a por ella y as lo comprend a o todas las bocas que hab an mordido su boca todas las manos que le hab an asido los senos y el vientre todos los miem bros que hab an penetrado en ella y que hab an de mostrado que estaba prostituida al mismo tiempo en cierto modo tambi n la hab an consagrado pero a los ojos de ren esto no era nada comparado con la prueba que aportaba sir stephen cada vez que ella sal a de sus brazos ren buscaba en ella la marca de un dios o sab a que si hac a unas horas la hab a delatado fue para provocar un nuevo y m s cruel castigo que la dejara se alada
2604247 ella nunca dud que una mujer pudiera ser tan cruel y m s implacable que un hombre pero o pensaba que anne marie buscaba menos que manifestar su poder establecer entre ella y o una complicidad o nunca comprendi el porqu pero hab a tenido que reconocer como verdad innegable el signo con tradictorio de sus sentimientos le gustaba la idea del suplicio mientras lo sufr a hubiera traicionado al mundo entero para sustraerse a l pero cuando se terminaba estaba contenta de haberlo sufrido y tanto m s contenta cuanto m s largo y cruel hu biera sido
2604248 bastaba pues que me diera a sir stephen para que me desligara de l y entre unos brazos nuevos naciera a un nuevo amor pero qu era ren al lado de sir stephen cuerda de heno amarra de paja cadenas de corcho stos eran los s mbolos de los lazos con que hab a querido sujetarla l para desecharla tan pronto pero qu seguridad qu delicia la anilla de hierro que taladra la carne y pesa siempre la marca que nunca se bo rrar la mano de un amo que te tiende un lecho de roca el amor de un due o que sabe apoderarse sin piedad de aquello que ama y o se dec a que a fin de cuentas no hab a amado a ren sino para aprender lo que era el amor y saber darse mejor esclavi zada y colmada a sir stephen
2604249 se atrever a a decirle alg n d a que no hab a placer ni alegr a ni fantas a que pudiera com pararse con la felicidad que sent a por la libertad con que l se serv a de ella por la idea de que no le guardaba ning n miramiento ni pon a l mite a la forma en que buscaba el placer en su cuerpo la certeza que ten a de que cuando l la tocaba ya fuera para acariciarla o para golpearla que cuando le ordenaba algo era nicamente porque lo deseaba la certeza de que l no pensaba m s que en su propio placer colmaba a o de tal manera que cada vez que ten a prueba de ello o solamente cada vez que lo pensaba se abat a sobre ella una capa de hierro una coraza ardiente que le iba desde los hom bros hasta las rodillas

2604260 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2604261 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private

2604274 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2604275 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2604276 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2604277 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2604325 from what ive heard hes one of the top guys in the minor leagues and big leagues combined in innings pitched
2604326 its not my decision i just go out there when they give me the ball
2604327 i feel fine i feel i can go out there whenever they tell me to its part of the deal i guess theyre concerned about innings i guess ive got a lot of them theres nothing to complain about im at the place i want to be and the place i want to stay its just all about how you stay there
2604328 if for some reason millwoods not ready to go well send him back out there
2604329 we dont know if grudzielanek is going to be back or not
2604330 hes got a tear in that ligament and its all going to be dependent on how it reacts in the next couple of weeks
2604331 hes working with the rehab center in san diego but theres not a whole lot he can do right now
2604332 i cant tell you when to expect him back or if he will be back a return would be dangerous if theres not some pretty quick healing
2604333 yesterday they figured that they only needed one day and they were both right
2604334 with the way that looked it didnt look like he would be playing today
2604335 id say he has a very high pain tolerance and an ability to mentally overcome a lot of nagging injuries
2604336 hes been out there almost every day through it and his performance hasnt dropped at all
2604337 its nothing i could complain about in boston look at that team and what they had there in that outfield were talking j d drew manny ramirez jacoby ellsbury and coco crisp at the time in the outfield thats a situation where you take what you can get but this is a situation i was exactly hoping for
2604338 being with the pirates is all a matter of perspective
2604339 for me i see it as a great opportunity i was excited and a little sad when i heard the news i was traded all i ever knew was the red sox thats the team that drafted me gave me an opportunity and a team and organization ive been with for six years the red sox told me that they didnt want to let me go and it was a hard decision for them to make we had a great relationship so it was hard for me to leave
2604340 i was on the bench for so long in boston getting my timing down will be the biggest test since i was playing once or twice a week for the last three months
2604341 ive always knew about the pirates growing up around atlanta in the 1990s and being a braves fan i knew about the pirates but ive never been to pittsburgh in my life ive never been to pnc park but all i hear is that its a great place to play
2604342 i know for me personally that the more i get out there the better i get and the less i get out there the worse i get but our starters have been going really good
2604343 youd like to give them a nice balance of work
2604344 but the majority of them have been out there in the bullpen for their whole lives and have experience in these types of situations being overworked and being underworked
2604345 you dont want anyone to go seven or eight days without pitching but sometimes it just works out that way a lot of it is just certain situations that arise and you work around it the best you can
2604346 those are just situations where its tough to keep the roles in order and get everybody work
2604347 its a good problem to have and experience has always taught me that these things always work themselves out
2604348 a few times on the last road trip i got up to go in but didnt end up getting into the game
2604349 thats how i stay sharp i dont really do much side work other than that that has to be enough because there is no other way unless you get in the game
2604350 they all do side work throwing off flat ground in the pregame
2604351 if they need a little extra theyll do a little side work off the mound in the bullpen and some will throw during the game out there
2604352 its not like competition there is nothing like throwing with a hitter up there with a packed stadium

2604359 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2604360 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2604361 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on nonuse of force with south ossetians
2604362 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2604363 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia

2604365 peter coes contribution to sebs success and to british athletics was always of gold medal standard

2604379 the opening night and the closing night of that musical the did a run of shows leading up to this weekends

2604381 sometimes its 6 percent sometimes its less sometimes its more it depends on what the agent and seller agree to
2604382 well this is a rather nice show with a ton of effort put towards it but they really do have problems with human rights and pollution which they do not portray at all
2604383 crouch and defoe are a natural combination a natural way of playing when you see that
2604384 defoe will run through while crouch will lead off when crouch gets to the last third hes a natural threat because of his height and of course with the quickness of defoes feet you can see that they have a natural way they may play defoe differently away from home
2604385 youve just got to keep going and well see what happens over the next couple of years i think what the new manager is looking for is not just a good team but also a good squad
2604386 it really is up to the powers that be if harry is going to have the money to buy another couple of players
2604387 as a team we need at least a couple more of top quality the gaffers going to try to find a couple maybe even three you need that to keep the standard up whether the moneys going to be available i dont know you definitely need everybody fit and two or three players of real quality in there just to cope with the load of games

2604393 okay roy hodgsons brought a lot of players in but with no disrespect to fulham theyre a team you have to beat if youre going to have any chance of staying up
2604394 i do take the law very seriously deeply seriously because fragile as reason is and limited as law is as the expression of the institutionalized medium of reason thats all we have standing between us and the tyranny of mere will and the cruelty of the unbridled undisciplined feeling
2604395 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
2604396 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
2604397 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
2604398 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
2604399 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
2604400 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
2604401 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
2604402 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
2604403 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
2604404 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
2604405 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
2604406 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
2604407 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
2604408 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
2604409 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
2604410 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
2604411 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
2604412 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
2604413 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
2604414 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
2604415 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
2604416 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
2604417 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
2604418 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
2604419 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
2604420 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
2604421 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
2604422 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
2604423 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
2604424 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
2604425 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
2604426 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
2604427 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
2604428 1 i get it because thats a number and not grammar
2604429 ive been a big fan of sploosh theres also the awesome schnik of wolverines claws coming out
2604430 i have to disagree i dont think everyone thinks their screenplay is great
2604431 force myself to write some dialogue for these characters ive created
2604432 sometimes you just watch the news read an article a book watch a movie whatever and an idea for a non preconceived plan pops up in your head and its so good that your gut tells you to use it
2604433 theres a difference between knowing the bits you can use to fill out a quiz and knowing how someone will react in any given situation
2604434 my process of understanding a person is to dissect their inner emotional life
2604435 never hurry take plenty of exercise always be cheerful take all the sleep you need you may expect to be well
2604436 the court is suggesting that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law this has a tremendous chilling effect on research we intend to fight it with everything weve got
2604437 we disagree with the ruling but we are not going to disobey it
2604438 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community if you want to fix a system you need to know what is wrong with it
2604439 if the discoverer discloses the vulnerability to a broader audience hackers and other malicious users may be able to exploit the vulnerability
2604440 it is strongly in the public interest to protect this system
2604441 the order does not appear to contemplate it is talking about a person who is giving a talk to humans
2604442 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation this should of course be free speech
2604443 the central question poses itself somewhere in the first act
2604444 making the central question important enough dramatic enough compelling enough to hold our interest through to the end and to me thats the hardest part of getting the central question right
2604445 how the hell is ethan hawke going to get through this day
2604446 will harry defeat the terrorists in a very exciting james cameron explosive fashion
2604447 certainly a classic like die hard the central question is pretty up front will john stop the terrorists
2604448 1 will john and holly work out their problems and get back together 2 can two serious career people ever really keep a solid relationship going 3 will john defeat the terrorist thieves and save holly 4 will john acknowledge hollys career is just as legitimate and important as his own
2604449 i see the central dramatic question as more of the prime mover that allows the character to discover and overcome the inner conflict
2604450 will the protagonist overcome his her flaw in time to defeat the antagonist save themselves loved ones the world etc
2604451 climax is really hard to teach because it can be subjective
2604452 3 will john defeat the terrorist thieves and save holly
2604453 like it wasnt hard enough for him to reunite with his wife now he has to defeat terrorists to do so you gotta be kidding me
2604454 in film a sequence is a series of scenes which form a distinct narrative unit usually connected either by unity of location or unity of time for example a heist film might include an extended recruitment sequence in which the leader of the gang collects together the conspirators a robbery sequence an escape sequence and so on each of these sequences might further contain sub sequences for example the robbery sequence might consist of an entry sequence a safe cracking sequence and so on
2604455 an episode is a part of a dramatic work such as a serial television or radio program an episode is a part of a sequence of a body of work akin to a chapter of a book
2604456 what i call act 2 into what you are calling acts 2 and 3
2604457 neo didnt try to beat the matrix in the matrix the movie was about him finding himself thats it
2604458 the problem making the central question important enough dramatic enough compelling enough to hold our interest through to the end and to me thats the hardest part of getting the central question right
2604459 they more or less shed the immediate want or desire as they make their way on their journey into the new world and as they explore and learn what they need to learn in the new world their immediate want or desire develops and grows to an overall want or desire that drives them through the rest of the story or movie
2604460 what lies at the heart of man good or evil
2604461 will the good of humanity ultimately triumph over its evil
2604462 how the protagonists character is able to adapt or grow in response to x issue
2604463 what will it take for you to accept help or working with another
2604464 ive written an complex multi dementional character with inner conflicts that actors would die to play
2604465 will gotham go back the way it came or will gothamites help their city
2604466 do i accept bruce as batman or find a regular non vigilante
2604467 because they dont know which elements are central to their story and which arent
2604468 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the 1 billion 520m a year that the americans have been giving for the armed forces
2604469 the army has been getting 250m 300m reimbursement for what they do but wheres the rest
2604470 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700m a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it
2604471 i think he musharraf has a slush fund being used for this and for some activity for the future
2604472 they spent all the money so we would have to borrow they didnt pass on the increased price of oil nor added a single extra megawatt of power in the last 10 years all these things were deliberately thought out so at the end of day they can turn round and tell the world look democracy doesnt deliver and step back in
2604473 i havent touched one thing in her bedroom her manuscript of her last book is lying on her side and i sleep on my side
2604474 i think shes looking at us now and saying now tell me asif do you think its easy
2604475 to say were responsible for the country yes we are but first get your role model out of the way remove your most allied of allies
2604476 theyve had musharraf there 10 years instead of bringing these issues up with him they are trying to bring them up with us today
2604477 the offer was on the table that you walk and you dont get prosecuted but ive had no returns so have had no choice but to go along with my partners more aggressive stance
2604478 if he does it it will be his last verdict against the people the peoples mandate and against pakistan
2604479 our bedroom in dubai has been locked and i sleep in the next room because the children and i dont want to lose her scent in the room
2604480 improve results and get more gold medals for the nation
2604481 the motherland is above everything strike for gold in the olympics
2604482 there will be no champion if one does not go through the ultimate pressure
2604483 the coaches can be very dictatorial issuing orders to athletes without explaining why
2604484 some also get angry with us and say were meddling that athletes should just follow their orders
2604485 they need to calm down not see this as the beginning or end of their life but a step along the way
2604486 i always missed my family but my coach brought me up and we were closer than he was with his own children
2604487 we need to do more to consider them an overall human being
2604488 not only does positive feedback help build the athletes confidence
2604489 it also leads to more creativity and innovation in training regimens
2604490 do not leave your subplots unattended dont get us all spun up in a b c or d story and then forget to tie it up
2604491 is the current development laws for a writer to get his her work produced one that works for most writers
2604492 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure

2604508 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2604509 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2604510 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2604511 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2604512 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2604513 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2604514 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2604515 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2604626 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
2604627 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
2604628 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
2604629 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this

2604716 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
2604717 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble

2604721 the two presidential candidates had been here to listen not to talk
2604722 despite the improvements in security the central government has not demonstrated that it can construct a top down political accommodation for iraq the iraqi government is afflicted by corruption and shows signs of sectarian bias it still has not secured the confidence of most iraqis or demonstrated much competence in performing the basic government functions including managing iraqs oil wealth overseeing reconstruction programs delivering government assistance to the provinces or creating jobs
2604723 iraq will be an unstable country for the foreseeable future and if some type of political settlement can be reached it will be inherently fragile
2604724 lengthy and repeated deployments with insufficient recovery time at home stations have placed incredible stress on our soldiers and on their families testing the resolve of the all volunteer force like never before
2604725 ive never seen our lack of strength of strategic depth be where it is today
2604726 the questions are whether and how improvements in security can be converted into political gains that can stabilize iraq despite the impending drawdown of united states troops
2604727 simply appealing for more time to make progress is insufficient debate over how much progress we have made and whether we can make more is less illuminating than determining whether the administration has a definable political strategy that recognizes the time limitations that we face and seeks a realistic outcome designed to protect american vital interests

2604744 they the teeth are absolutely invaluable it underpins everything that we learn about these animals theyre kind of like gold
2604745 having the teeth is quite unique because they were whole family pods and you dont get access to pods in any other way
2604746 to study these animals in the wild if theyre still alive and swimming around you just cant do it so even if you went to do biopsies for skin samples you just cant do it you never get the whole pod
2604747 you can count those ridges and it basically gives you the age of the animal
2604748 what tends to happen is if one individual has stranded the social bonds between that group mean that the rest of the group dont want to leave the area without that individual

2604750 we are heading out on two expeditions each close to a month long to map the full length of the cayman trough
2604751 it is the worlds deepest volcanic ridge and totally unexplored
2604752 we are hoping to find several different types of vents along the ridge
2604753 some of the vents will be very similar in depth to the vents we already know about and because the conditions will be alike we might expect very similar animals
2604754 the deep ocean is our planets largest ecosystem if we are going to use its resources responsibly then we need understand what determines its patterns of life
2604755 they could be hotter than 500c 930f and if they are that hot they will probably have quite different chemistry and life forms we expect to find new species
2604756 although it is a little frightening because of the expensive digital camera hanging just above the water thats nerve wracking
2604757 as soon as you get into any depth you cant see through the water
2604758 if the grass disappears its a general indication the environment is less healthy
2604759 people think its extremely abundant and that its not that important

2604766 however he calls it is how were going to do it obviously if he asks my advice in certain situations im going to give it to him were in this together
2604767 you know i have seen you week after week setting up all of this that is a lot of work
2604768 i am so happy that god would let me come out here and tell others what jesus has done for me
2604769 were you hurt deeply and perhaps even abused as a child so that you cannot feel the combination of romance and love
2604770 when i feel like reading it now i feel like a rebel
2604771 i dont think i am saved i mean i want to be but i am not sure
2604772 the bible says in 1 john 5 13 that we can know we have eternal life if we believe on the name of the son of god i pray that he will give you the faith to believe him as the god he claims to be in the bible we have to agree with jesus about who he is and who we are apart from him sinners in order to know him as savior he then begins a work to change us and draw us closer to him
2604773 i read the bible every night how could i read the bible every night and not be for israel yes of course i am for israel since my savior was from there
2604774 you could become jewish if you wanted you could convert
2604775 jesus said that he came to fulfill the law he is my fulfillment of the law and i would not have it any other way my gentile forefathers worshiped idols but i have been grafted in through jesus to worship the god of abraham isaac and jacob i am chosen through adoption the bible says
2604776 you know john the baptist was the first christian missionary
2604777 yes he was jewish and went about telling everyone about jesus a man whose sandals he was unworthy to untie
2604778 acts 17 30 explains that god is calling me everywhere now to repent and believe on jesus for salvation he is the only savior for our sins
2604779 have you got anything on other religions i am going to be a chaplain soon
2604780 you are going to come back to the lord the lord has let me know that he is going to save you
2604781 god loves me more more than my mother loved me and my mothers deep love for me came from god
2604782 when we read john 17 and how much jesus loves his own yes no words can explain our feeling of gratitude
2604783 i just weep and weep sometimes when i think of how much he loves me
2604784 i cant believe god would let me set up outreaches like this to tell others about such a savior it is foolishness to the world but to me it is a high honor of which i am so unworthy
2604785 truly truly i say to you i am the door of the sheep if anyone enters through me he shall be saved and go in and out and find pasture the thief comes only to steal kill and destroy i came that they might have life and might have it abundantly

2604935 sabemos que los agentes trabajan aunque es muy dif cil porque no hay una pista s lida que les lleve hasta l ellos har n lo que puedan y confiamos en que el periodo de vacaciones no perjudique en las investigaciones
2604936 no haya llamado ninguna vez que yo sepa para saber c mo est la familia y es algo qu s hac a el anterior jos segura cada vez que pasa el tiempo es peor no se puede superar su falta y es algo que no se olvida nunca

2604941 no se consigue con la creaci n de otro cuerpo policial
2604942 en los entrenamientos trabajamos generalmente sobre nosotros mismos y del rival hacemos algo m s espec fico el d a anterior y el mismo d a del partido esto es lo que vamos a hacer con grecia l gicamente cosas nuestras que estamos trabajando nos sirven para grecia y para todo
2604943 lo que todav a no s c mo solucionar es el d a de alemania porque si tenemos que hablar el d a anterior y el d a del partido nos vamos a tener que levantar a las cuatro de la ma ana porque es la primera vez que vamos a jugar a las nueve
2604944 somos conscientes de que lo estamos haciendo bien y de que lo hemos hecho bien pero tenemos que hacerlo bien de ahora en adelante y aun as est la dificultad de los rivales
2604945 este equipo tiene calidad el momento del baloncesto espa ol es muy bueno y hay mucha calidad vamos a intentar aprovechar esta calidad para poder seguir diciendo lo mismo despu s de los juegos porque sabemos que las cosas hay que demostrarlas haci ndolas
2604946 el emparejamiento de dobles es de lo peor que te puede tocar no hemos tenido suerte porque el equipo sueco es muy fuerte pero hay que jugarlo y vamos a intentar sacar el partido adelante
2604947 es un rival duro con mucha experiencia y que se encuentra en un buen momento
2604948 era inviable para la zona porque en el lugar hay rboles con mucho porte que son especies protegidas y no ser a factible trasladarlas

2604950 la estrategia que ten amos pensada y preparada para la ce ida ha sido err nea
2604951 hemos tenido algo m s de presi n y hemos conseguido recuperar en el tramo final las boyas de sotavento con poco viento y muchos barcos se convierten en cr ticas y mientras en la segunda manga he pasado bien en la primera he cometido un desastre de escuela de vela de iniciaci n
2604952 abre mucho el panorama eso es lo divertido pues aunque vayas 14 puedes tener opciones en realidad ste es un campo divertido precioso de navegar con corrientes cambios de presi n lo que pasa es que con un r gimen tan flaco de viento todo puede cambiar en un momento
2604953 debido a la relevancia del problema y a la falta de informaci n en nuestra isla consider oportuno llevar a cabo este estudio sobre la frecuencia y factores de riesgo de los trastornos de voz en el personal de ense anza media de la isla
2604954 en este sentido el n mero de alumnos por clase es una variable de gran importancia puesto que a medida que aumenta el alumnado crecen tanto los problemas de ronquera como las alteraciones de la voz en los docentes con lo cual es muy importante hacer grupos homog neos de alumnos lo m s peque o posibles y evitar las clases saturadas
2604955 con lo cual otra estrategia en la que se podr a trabajar para disminuir este problema es una buena formaci n en t cnicas de abordar las clases sin tener que gritar

2604993 whispered in musharrafs ear that it is time to leave
2604994 over the next few days they will make it clear to him musharraf that a protracted battle against impeachment is not in pakistans interests
2604995 it is as though the us does not understand international law its meddling in anwars case goes to show that the powerful nation is biased and only out to meddle in our internal affairs we will bring this matter to the un as this has to be stopped soon
2604996 i am not concerned about the relationship between them the us and anwar i am just reminding them to look beyond the interests of one person and not blame our legal system
2604997 sodomy is a crime in our country our legal system is different from that of the us and they must understand this
2604998 there should not be any doubt about the island being part of our territory
2604999 the four islands which made up the pulau pisang island group belong to johor and this was affirmed by an agreement between sultan ibrahim of johor and the british colonial government in 1900
2605000 the agreement also stipulated the exact size of the area where the lighthouse and jetty to be used by its personnel are to be built
2605001 there are currently 87 farmers who tend to their orchards on the island
2605002 the trickle effects of the projects will definitely go down to the local smes
2605003 even if this project turns out to be a success it would not seem likely to be ours
2605004 please bear in mind that iskandar malaysia is just two years old we have to be patient with it
2605005 the smes have their own unique characteristics which make them important players in our economy
2605006 the state government will continue to support them and provide whatever assistance available
2605007 i will not say that the tariffs will be reduced but it will be relatively better considering the present circumstances
2605008 they definitely havent reached out to the younger generation as strongly as i hoped they would
2605009 its a big mistake youve got to create something that people want to be a part of im just not getting that feeling this go round
2605010 republicans are sort of talking down to gen nexters not bringing them in
2605011 let me just start by saying that it would not be unheard of for a republican candidate to win the youth vote
2605012 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable
2605013 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2605014 i knew on the last lap that my chance had gone
2605015 i got stuck behind watching valverde im disappointed but i cant complain the race was very tough
2605016 i told my small team before the race to follow the big countries
2605017 i tried everything and it was very close this was a very important game for me of course i am disappointed but that is how it goes
2605018 i played okay but im obviously devastated with the loss i came so close
2605019 the three mps are fong po kuan batu gajah sim tong hin kota melaka and charles santiago klang
2605020 under our regulations they dont need to state their reason for withdrawing
2605021 i think that is going to be one of the most watched games in sports history
2605022 hes not going to score 100 points and we hope to come close to scoring 100 points
2605023 i think you have to make sure that he doesnt dominate the game
2605024 chu sian and marbawi had average scores but luckily for us khalmizam kept his focus from the start to take us into third place
2605025 what i know is that i have never scored this high but there is still work to be done as anything can happen in the elimination rounds
2605026 i cant deny it was an important issue there are very few players who left me against my wi ll
2605027 real madrid now know they are dealing with a different animal and cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here
2605028 he has got four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully we would like to extend it
2605029 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2605030 the specialist he saw yesterday thursday and is delighted with the progress
2605031 well now take him to the next stage and for a month he will be in rehabilitation and then he should be in full training by that time
2605032 this is a competition on the home court i had the special support of the crowd especially from chinas fans and so i dont think i was under great pressure
2605033 im glad expectations are high as they should be its an honour for us to have that bestowed upon us i have worked very hard to have that kind of pressure
2605034 if there was no pressure that would mean i have no chance at a medal if there was ever a chance for me to be on top of the podium its now
2605035 because i am in the best form of my life by far and i believe that i can do it i really do
2605036 im not thinking too much about that but its like a dream come true
2605037 its a new beginning in the team event we play hong kong china followed by germany and then romania
2605038 it will not be easy to play against any of them but thats the olympic games
2605039 its always a game we never quite use of a do or die thing we use it is a barometer for fitness
2605040 sometimes in the past weve played players who were never nearly fit just because we have to give them games and give them minutes on clock before the start of the season
2605041 once the flow of the team came and the fitness came we ended up winning the league
2605042 we have a bit of illness of course and weve got one player nani suspended for the opening matches so its exactly like last season
2605043 the difference is we are a year older theres great quality in the squad and theres a great enthusiasm that has been accelerated by winning the european cup
2605044 they had a great season last year and now harry has brought crouch into the squad the partnership of crouch and defoe will be a handful for anyone now but hopefully we can cope with that
2605045 the atmosphere was really good everybody telling you go go go ive never had that feeling before
2605046 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2605047 im used as cannon fodder they said send the old bugger out there first and see what happens
2605048 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2605049 its going to be a race between three or four of us tomorrow night today and im looking forward to it or tomorrow morning today i should say
2605050 its going to be a tough one but im sure going to give him a run for his money
2605051 i do get a little bit jittery thinking about it
2605052 tomorrow today im sure i will really be on edge
2605053 i dont want to be in lane four given to the fastest swimmer
2605054 i dont swim well when im the centre of attention
2605055 teams such as germany the netherlands and spain are all quality teams who along with a number of other countries are all capable of winning gold at beijing
2605056 we dont know what will happen but were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2605057 the president of the brazilian football confederation ricardo teixeira accepted the brazilian olympic committees request that the olympic team did not wear the official jersey because it would blemish brazils bid to host the 2016 olympics
2605058 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2605059 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2605060 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2605061 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2605062 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2605063 trotz kaputtem knie und katastrophalem katzenbuckel zu spitzenleistungen bei den paralympics durch push up spritze von pille amp palle
2605064 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2605065 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2605066 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2605118 we zijn er anderhalf uur bezig geweest met twee collegas
2605119 die agenten zijn er in tien minuten heengereden dan kun je wel nagaan dat ze niet vijftig kilometer per uur hebben gereden
2605120 jan heeft voor zichzelf n mij alvast besloten dat mocht ie ooit een zoon krijgen die dan vernoemd wordt naar hemzelf ik kan op mijn kop gaan staan en al maar die beslissing is allang genomen
2605121 that sounds like a fair deal to me maar hoe zou het zijn als je alleen maar allemaal dochters krijgt wordt het dan verplicht een janneke
2605122 het lijkt me fantastisch om achter de schermen jong televisietalent op te leiden met zon jonge club zou ik bijvoorbeeld heel graag een vernieuwde telekids willen maken
2605123 ik weet zeker dat er ook weer een periode komt dat het publiek even geen zin heeft in carlo boszhard

2605125 hans agerande de senaste tta ren har varit s brutalt och s katastrofalt att jag har sv rt att se n got positivt i honom
2605126 it was a day to play young guys and it served its purpose in terms of giving us an assessment we had a chance to see two kickers square off i would have liked to have seen more kicks there but that gave us a decent idea we got some young running backs touches in case harvey unga or fui vakapuna arent able to perform or get hurt
2605127 we saw a lot of the young linebackers and secondary players play and so there is going to be some pretty critical decisions made as you watch maybe monday or tuesdays practice as to players that might have moved up or down in the depth positions
2605128 we have been charting every kick from the minute fall camp began and so literally the numbers will decide
2605129 my job is to just try to put the situations as equal as possible and expose them to similar pressure so if we get the same volume of kicks the same pressure and the same circumstances then hopefully the job will be clear and it will be based on the numbers rather than just me having to pick who i feel best about
2605130 when you have the first five practices that are in half pads or no pads it is difficult to get caught up in the run game or to assess that part early so we made a focus on running the ball and stopping the run to see where we are in that part and so the best part about it is we were able to assess that and i think we are decent on both sides not dominant on either side but that gave us a day to focus on maybe an area because of what the ncaa rules say to maybe accelerate that part of our program
2605131 a very close third right now to either kellen or david and would possibly be the next player in at either spot
2605132 this was just a scrimmage so it doesnt mean nothin really game day will tell

2605140 barring a kind of anti realism that none of us should tolerate wouldnt it be remarkable if the lines of reality match the lines that we have words for the simplest exercises of sociological imagination ought to convince us that the assumption of such a harmony is altogether untoward since such exercises convince us that it is something of a biological and or cultural accident that we draw the lines that we do
2605141 theyd be stupid because they would have to have different intuitions than we do

2605143 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2605144 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders

2605146 if they could be so known then non english speakers should be able to know them simply by reflecting on and reasoning about them which of course they cannot

2605151 the possible individuals in question will be inhabitants of a world other than our own in which princeton has a philosophy department in order for them to understand the princeton proposition which is at least in part a proposition about our world they have to be able to think about our world singling out a specific nonactual world in thought is no small feat but we may suppose that their mental capacities far exceed our own and that they are able to get our world uniquely in mind by imagining it in full detail

2605159 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier

2605173 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
2605174 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all
2605175 of course our concern is for him and that he doesnt risk further injury but im sure eddy knows his body well and will know exactly how much he can give or whether or not he needs to rest speaking on behalf of the team i can say were all ecstatic to have him back
2605176 m s de cuatro a os de su vida gastaron mar a y eduardo en un noviazgo aparentemente feliz que se acab cuando terminaron la carrera que estudiaron juntos fue como si hubieran agotado los temas de conversaci n que ten an en la universidad para entrar en una competencia profesional que lejos de dar trascendencia a su relaci n marcaba territorios incompatibles finalmente eduardo confes que cuando se dio cuenta de que su noviazgo le reclamaba mas formalidad tuvo miedo de continuar porque necesitaba tiempo para saber si mar a era la mujer con quien realmente deseaba pasar el resto de su vida su caso es el de cada vez m s parejas modernas que huyen de la responsabilidad como del demonio incluso cuando ya tienen todo preparado para la boda quiz s no supieron nunca que el verdadero amor no se traduce en sentir bonito cuando se est frente a la pareja y que tampoco significa estar de acuerdo en todo lo que se hace porque cuando realmente se ama a alguien se adquiere el compromiso moral de ayudarlo respetuosamente a ser mejor a que crezca como ser humano en todos los aspectos cuando los j venes sue an con encontrar al pr ncipe azul o a la s per mujer para ser felices siempre tendr n que plantearse con toda seriedad si no est n esquizofr nicos porque un mundo as solo se da en las letras o en las telenovelas donde navegamos a merced de la imaginaci n del autor pero no en el mundo donde el creador ha dispuesto para los hombres la felicidad y el sufrimiento los logros y los fracasos la aceptaci n y el rechazo y la lucha constante y permanente desde que nacemos hasta que dejamos de respirar hace poco llego a mis manos una informaci n de cimac en la que martha celia herrera psicoterapeuta del centro de interdisciplina conductuales asegura que las mujeres aun hoy conservan la expectativa de encontrar a un hombre maduro productivo estable rico inteligente paternal que cambie pa ales que las acompa e al pediatra que sepa preparar papillas que sea una excelente pareja tierno que externe sus emociones que no pida relaciones intimas cuando ella est enojada que sea emp tico ellos entre tanto buscan a la mujer de sus sue os productiva inteligente excelente anfitriona que desee uno o dos hijos cuando l lo decida que no pida dinero que sea autosuficiente independiente y aut noma que colabore en la econom a familiar y que cuide a los ni os que lave planche cocine y tenga bien arreglada la casa adem s de que se d tiempo para cuidar su apariencia que siempre est s per delgada que sea vea sexy etc etc la doctora herrera dice que con la revoluci n sexual y el feminismo se rompi el equilibrio tradicional entre el papel que correspond a a los hombres y el que estaba destinado a las mujeres los varones se asustan frente a las mujeres que compiten con ellos en su espacio laboral y que a menudo est n m s calificadas que ellos y esa amenaza a veces se extiende al campo sentimental influye tambi n que se dividieron los roles pero nunca quedaron delineados ahora la mujer tiene m s actividades que antes porque debe estudiar trabajar y atender a su familia hecho que resulta desconcertante para todos las expectativas femeninas y las masculinas son irreales y poco objetivas muchos ni siquiera son capaces de expresar lo que esperan del otro yo no soy psicoterapeuta pero se que en la vida nada es m gico ni gratuito los hombres y las mujeres hemos sido siempre los mismos aunque las circunstancias han cambiado y en este rengl n no tan positivamente como seria deseable hoy queremos que todo sea f cil y desechable pero eso no es posible en las personas nadie est ya hecho la vida entera no nos alcanza a veces para irnos moldeando seg n nuestras metas y proyectos de la misma manera dos seres inacabados que tendr an que estar conscientes de que van a esculpirse juntos durante toda la vida anhelar un pr ncipe azul o una s per mujer junto a nosotros no es un pecado pero si puede llegar a convertirse en un obst culo para ser felices al lado de un ser humano de carne y hueso con potencialidades y miserias que como nosotros necesita comprensi n y verdadero amor para perfeccionarse poco a poco si hoy tantas relaciones se rompen despu s de un tiempo de tratarse en su noviazgo es precisamente porque no estamos dispuestos a trabajar para forjar una relaci n sana sincera basada en el verdadero amor que no es solo romanticismo sino prueba constante de fidelidad comunicaci n respeto y de humanidad curiosamente la doctora herrera concluye que mientras estudian licenciaturas maestr as y doctorados hombres y mujeres no se dan tiempo para habilitarse en pareja para hablar de si mismos todo eso se queda guardado y cuando cumplen 30 a os o m s deciden tener un compa ero suponen que como por arte de magia contar n con habilidades que no desarrollaron porque nunca se dieron tiempo para hacerlo para relacionarse con otra persona hay que estar dispuesto a negociar a manejar enojos a discutir no pelear porque aunque existan puntos de vista diferentes es posible conseguir objetivos que satisfagan a los dos dice la doctora pero eso cuesta quiz s el problema radica en que nadie desea comprometerse a entablar la lucha por lograrlo demasiado ego smo dir a yo cada d a son m s las mujeres y hombres profesionistas independientes inteligentes y de exito que ven pasar los a os sin encontrar pareja personas de todas las clases sociales se encuentran frente al mismo problema son solteros y solteras se han quedado atrapados as en un espacio dentro de la sociedad actual muy limitado en cuanto a diversiones y actividades y se les dificulta mucho encontrar personas en su misma situaci n ya no se diga para casarse sino simplemente para acompa arse y entablar una buena amistad ya no existe la palabra solter n a y su imagen ha cambiado 180 grados ya no es el hombre o la mujer gris amargada vestido como fraile o monja seg n sea el caso ahora son seres impecables atractivos as de muy buen car cter que van supliendo la juventud con personalidad y desarrollo humano e intelectual que hay demasiadas mujeres y pocos hombres es una idea que se escucha todos los d as y que ha llegado a penetrar profundo en la conciencia de las mujeres de todos los estratos sociales este punto se da como un hecho apoyado en estad sticas generalmente falsas o bastante caprichosas a un n mero determinado de mujeres les corresponde un n mero equivalente de hombres a diferencia de la idea com n de que por cada hombre hay cinco o seis mujeres pero la soledad no es exclusiva de aquellas personas que son solteras hay mujeres que aun estando rodeadas de mucha gente llegan a sentirse muy solas y a sufrir de carencias afectivas tambi n entre mujeres y hombres casadas os que comparten su vida con su pareja es frecuente encontrar solas acompa adas para poder amar verdaderamente hay que renunciar a creer que ese sentimiento es el fin de la soledad y estar dispuestos a aceptar dos soledades la del otro y la propia y es que amor es confesar si yo te amo como tu eres aunque no correspondas a mis sue os y a mis esperanzas tu realidad me da mucho m s regocijo que mis sue os
2605177 i have no reason to be believe that the public is in any danger
2605178 its just so far outside the realm of what i consider possible
2605179 its not going to kill you but itll ruin your weekend
2605180 1st year undergrad commerce student fashion and photography obsessed blogs to spread the love
2605181 the only reason certain hos are popular is for what goes in their mouths not what comes out of them
2605182 we received a call that someone was smelling fumes in the area and we investigated with the coast guard and found oil in the canal between the power plant and the barrier
2605183 it didnt get into dickinson bayou and was stopped in the canal but there was an impact to coastal waters
2605184 every night we looked at the pictures and said heres the lobby and heres the classroom so it was not a new experience for her
2605185 its very important that they fit so they can go back to school and maybe feel a bit better because they have new shoes
2605186 he is a normal person and has never been spoken to about anything like this before
2605187 maybe the police in chile have got the wrong person
2605188 i spoke to his fiancee lorena and she is obviously concerned and upset
2605189 negotiating any piece of legislation through the senate is always a challenge
2605190 i have had discussions with some of the cross bench senators theyll continue and we will continue to argue vigorously for fuelwatch
2605191 this is really giving motorists the chance to call for a tender for their petrol and really the conservatives in the senate should get out of the way and let motorists have that opportunity
2605192 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2605193 its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2605194 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2605195 i always have believed that the australian public make a very clear distinction between voting for a territory government or voting for a state government and voting for a federal government
2605196 they understand fully all the implications of our federal system so i dont draw too much into the northern territory result and i wont draw too much from the west australian result other than to say we know it will be a tough election
2605197 but the liberals have been very much in disarray here wa and wa premier alan carpenters done a good job in difficult circumstances so whilst we think it will be tough were confident that alan carpenter will do well
2605198 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2605199 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign i think it is always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results on to federal results or vice versa

2605217 bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2605218 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2605219 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2605220 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2605221 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2605222 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man

2605291 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2605292 its a pity it took us so much time to score in the first half we had many opportunities we displayed a lot of desire in the second half
2605293 what a man does in private is his own business
2605294 we call on all the parties to immediately engage in a cease fire we urge all parties to commence the dialogue
2605295 the organisation for security and cooperation in europe osce has offered the finnish foreign minister to get the parties together to discuss what has been a longstanding difficult issue
2605296 the later statements that we hear especially from the international community are quite hopeful
2605297 what we right now need is at least a one day cease fire to get all the civilians out and then we can move on things from there
2605298 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are of course a crime and above all its a crime against their own people
2605299 thats because a mortal blow has been dealt to the territorial integrity of georgia itself
2605300 therefore huge damage has been inflicted on its statehood its hard to imagine how south ossetia can be convinced to be a part of the georgian state
2605301 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate moreover they are necessary in line with existing international agreements
2605302 russia is not only carrying out peacekeeping tasks but is also obliged if one of the sides violates a cease fire agreement to protect the other side
2605303 i have a mandate to to liberate the zone of conflict from violators
2605304 whatever it takes we will do the only way to stop it is for the commander in chief of the georgian army to withdraw from the area they illegally occupied
2605305 a tank assault has been stopped on the southern suburbs of tskhinvali 12 georgian tanks have been put out of action
2605306 we are defending against a georgian infantry attack that is continuing in the south of tskhinvali
2605307 hes wandering around looking like fifi hit paris in digby
2605308 this is like richard nixon and the dirty tricks department of donald segretti
2605309 i mean it makes no sense if the guy wanted to come into the room all he had to do is take off his secret squirrel outfit that kind of behaviour might work well in the bush world of reaganomics and republican politics but it doesnt work in canada
2605310 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2605311 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2605312 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2605313 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market
2605314 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2605315 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2605316 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2605317 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2605318 the flex history manager lets users navigate through a flex application by using the web browsers back and forward navigation commands for example a user can navigate through several accordion container panes in a flex application and then click the browsers back button to return the application to its previous states the historymanager class provides a subset of functionality that is provided by the browsermanager class and deep linking in general you should use the browsermanager class and deep linking for maintaining state in an application and manipulating urls and browser history but the historymanager class can be useful under some circumstances such as if you are maintaining a flex 2 x application for more information about deep linking and the browsermanager class see about deep linking history management is implemented as a set of files that are referenced in the applications wrapper by default adobe flex builder generates a wrapper that supports history management but you can disable it when you deploy an application that uses the historymanager you must also deploy the history management files such as history css history js and historyframe html these are the same files that are used by the browsermanager for deep linking support for more information see deploying applications that use deep linking

2605342 the right of secession should be ingrained in a free society
2605343 order was only restored in l a when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks three days after rioting began
2605344 mainly because they have not yet been assimilated into our rotten liberal culture which admonishes whites faced by raging blacks to lie back and think of england
2605345 mostly black welfare recipients will feel justified in stealing from mostly white haves

2605353 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2605354 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2605355 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2605356 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2605357 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2605358 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2605359 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2605360 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2605361 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2605362 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2605373 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions the wind at the time was a south westerly force 5 7 with a moderate to rough sea state generating a heavy surf
2605374 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions
2605375 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2605376 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of they way the reproduce theres a huge potential for cross pollination it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2605377 distract from the real solutions that we all know we have our concern is that biofuels will distract people away from other solutions
2605378 its the long term environmental implications that we should be worried about
2605379 its difficult to predict what the long term consequences would be in the forests you have a vast number of species and a diverse ecosystem the trees last for a long time if something goes wrong the consequences are quite long term and significant

2605435 a reminder of obamas essential elusiveness and how little we understand about how the candidate himself would resolve these thorny problems
2605436 in the hardest cases im not always sure where professor obama or president obama for that matter comes down
2605437 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
2605438 the number of voters who intend to plump for mccain in november is probably pretty much set already

2605639 our counter thrust must be to prick holes in the stiff front erected by the russians leaders
2605640 there were several attacks on georgia but strictly on military targets
2605641 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2605642 if we allow ourselves to do that the world will end up on a slippery slope toward an endless series of military conflicts we cannot allow that to happen
2605643 im sure you figured it out sure youre the spitting image of each other
2605644 no os he escogido yo a vosotros los doce y uno de vosotros es diablo
2605645 os lo digo ahora antes de que suceda para que cuando suceda cre is que yo soy el que soy
2605646 entonces judas iscariote uno de los doce fue a los sumos sacerdotes para poner en sus manos a jes s ellos al o rlo se alegraron mucho y prometieron darle dinero y l buscaba oportunidad de entregarlo
2605647 era uno de los nuestros y obtuvo un puesto en este ministerio
2605648 fue acosado por el remordimiento y devolvi las treinta monedas de plata a los sumos sacerdotes y a los ancianos diciendo
2605649 el diablo hab a puesto en el coraz n a judas iscariote hijo de sim n el prop sito de entregarle
2605650 satan s entr en judas llamado iscariote que era del n mero de los doce
2605651 jos llamado barsab s por sobrenombre justo y mat as
2605652 judas se arrepinti y lleno de remordimiento devolvi las 30 monedas de plata diciendo
2605653 gozaos por cuanto sois participantes de los padecimientos de cristo
2605654 y qui n es aquel que os podr hacer da o si vosotros segu s el bien m s tambi n si alguna cosa padec is por causa de la justicia bienaventurados sois por tanto no os amedrent is por temor de ellos ni os conturb is sino santificad a dios el se or en vuestros corazones y estad siempre preparados para presentar defensa con mansedumbre y reverencia ante todo el que os demande raz n de la esperanza que hay en vosotros teniendo buena conciencia para que en lo que murmuran de vosotros como de malhechores sean avergonzados los que calumnian vuestra buena conducta en cristo porque mejor es que padezc is haciendo el bien si la voluntad de dios as lo quiere que haciendo el mal

2605656 always a big surge in business so sometimes its as much as thirty to forty percent uprise in business we look forward to it every four years because it helps our business
2605657 well it doesnt take a rocket scientist to know that insert blatantly obvious fact here
2605658 its replacement could be wiisports a pentathlon of tennis bowling golf baseball and boxing
2605659 theres plenty of skill involved with perfecting the tennis power serve or getting the right spin on a bowling ball
2605660 there would also be the added joy of seeing a 9 year old win the gold medal
2605661 you found a dead body down the street every week
2605662 i tell him theres a naked fellow in the plane he said omigod can you show me
2605663 looking back im thinking theres not many naked people on this plane
2605664 its a bit like having a football league with no footballs
2605665 i tested it i threw it in the pool and it didnt move at all so ill still have to swim
2605666 here is a better idea use instant replay to double check birth certificates
2605667 a 22 year old soldier with ties to the madison area was killed this week in afghanistan said his father michael brennan of mcfarland
2605668 he just wanted to be there for his friends and make sure they were ok
2605669 a highly decorated soldier brennan did not die immediately in the ambush he was shot in the chest but was still alive when taliban fighters tried to drag him away brennan said a medic who stood up to throw hand grenades at the taliban and prevent them from taking brennan was also killed brennan was taken by a helicopter to receive medical help his father said and died later
2605670 if that man is elected president hell be shot sure as hell
2605671 looking back on the way we always got together when josh would come home it was like we all knew we would only have him for a short time
2605672 he was a guy that could be responsible for others he could handle stress that most people couldnt fathom
2605673 for the 45 minutes that it took for the medevac bird to arrive josh continued to do cpr on lt derrick huntz even though he knew he was gone josh refused to let go i was left with the impression that as long as josh felt he could make a difference he would continue to give it his all
2605674 you guys throw the word hero around a lot and thats good but josh brennan was a hero before he died
2605675 he looked me in the eye and he said i dont know what your worried about
2605676 here we are josh standing right beside you and i know youre here looking down from above were still your brother were still your brothers
2605677 i would like all of you to stand up right now and be recognized as joshs brothers

2605683 hi youve reached the simon residence if your message is for ms simon press 1
2605684 its replacement could be wiisports a pentathlon of tennis bowling golf baseball and boxing
2605685 theres plenty of skill involved with perfecting the tennis power serve or getting the right spin on a bowling ball

2605692 here is a better idea use instant replay to double check birth certificates
2605693 equal parts shruggy new york indie strumming and groovy afro pop vampire weekends organ and drum runs highlight narratives about relationships punctuation and sometimes both
2605694 i climbed to dharamsala too i did i met the highest lama his accent sounded fine to me to me
2605695 take advantage of the natural cycles immanent in the reproductive system and engage in marital intercourse during those times that are infertile
2605696 i feel like it really works in harmony with the way that god designed our bodies to work
2605697 in contrast with the pill which works by altering and suppressing our natural systems nfp works by supporting those systems in harmony with their functions it goes with the flow so to speak there is a wisdom and a rightness to that which i really appreciate
2605698 the only spiritual objection i have to birth control is that for me using hormonal birth control indicates that i dont really trust god with every area of my life
2605699 it is an effort on my part to control something that i really believe god can be trusted with
2605700 a fascinating examination of gods sovereignty and human free will
2605701 what does it mean to submit your physical bodies to gods sovereign care
2605702 our personal experience in the past five years has shown that we had a lot to learn about nfp and that there is a dark side we werent aware of
2605703 during such times as well as during menopause and stressful life seasons strict nfp reaches a point where it is more harmful for a marriage than good
2605704 crazy or irresponsible to consider not being on the pill
2605705 protestant pastors are not used to talking about vaginal fluids
2605706 i took a view that china was going to be a world power
2605707 my kids started learning mandarin when they were four years old
2605708 when i went to taiwan 20 years ago and opened offices there i was impressed with the entrepreneurial spirit of the chinese people when they werent shackled
2605709 then in 2001 i travelled again over their major mainland industrial areas and noted that the taiwanese free spirit of business was spreading all through china
2605710 i dont see a revolution coming in china any more than in the united states
2605711 chinese people want change but not the radical change that western commentators imagine
2605712 the economic elite has either come out of the party elite or its been absorbed into it
2605713 otherwise not only will our generation lose face but also our ancestors
2605714 in the 1960s people werent necessarily convinced they were just terrorised into submission
2605715 now they stress management rather than control because they understand that persuasion is more effective than force
2605716 it does help explain the resilience of communist party rule despite the fissures in society and the corruption of much of officialdom
2605717 in the chinese cultural context a regimes legitimacy is conferred largely by its ability to mobilise this bureaucratic tradition
2605718 that is one of those real tipping points because that is something which they themselves whatever the rest of us think see as a fundamental core national interest
2605719 which doesnt mean necessarily that they will go to using that approach to their overall global engagements theyre going to need the rest of us for such a long time theres still so much that they cant do
2605720 theres no doubt that china saw the games as a sign of their international acceptance and its a good thing that they want it
2605721 in short to use an english expression they should take it easy
2605722 hey everyone english lessons right now in the elementary school theres a girl here from the u s ready to teach head on over if you want to learn english

2605743 these are always case by case bases its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2605744 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2605745 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2605746 20 1 a landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex including the rental units in it in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health safety housing and maintenance standards

2605750 that all the territories which japan has stolen from the chinese such as formosa and the pescadores shall be restored to the republic of china
2605751 im not afraid of the people its better to submit to the people than to certain domestic and foreign interests
2605752 we hope they find an agreement either before the referendum or immediately afterwards on just one interpretation of the rules
2605753 this referendum is illegal there is no room for a referendum in the constitution if the president looses he can call for an election but if one of the governors looses he will have to leave right away
2605754 the situation in bolivia is that what i do is legal and what my enemy does is illegal so right now nobody respects the laws
2605755 security as to how their votes will be counted and how the results will be defined
2605756 most people think the referendum is a distraction from the problems we have and i dont think itll change anything really

2605759 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2605760 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2605761 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2605762 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2605763 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2605764 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2605765 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2605766 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2605767 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2605768 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2605769 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2605770 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2605771 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2605772 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2605773 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2605774 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2605775 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2605776 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2605777 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2605778 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2605779 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2605780 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2605781 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2605782 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2605783 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2605784 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2605785 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2605786 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2605787 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2605788 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2605789 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2605790 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2605791 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2605792 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2605793 just so you all know we did set a record
2605794 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2605795 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2605796 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2605797 there is no excuse for the legislatures failure to reach a compromise and to send me a budget
2605798 until the legislature passes a budget that i can sign i will not sign any bills that reach my desk
2605799 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2605800 at the beginning of this case you were given every privilege that could be given to you with regard to travel
2605801 i apologize to the citizens as well but mostly to you
2605802 now that hes caught hes taking responsibility he thought he got away with it
2605803 weve got a lot of things in common with china
2605804 we view them as a very important country whos making an imprint and will make a bigger one as time goes by the u s china relationship in my viewpoint is about the most important bilateral relationship we have and for the president to insult china by not coming here would have been far worse
2605805 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2605806 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2605807 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2605808 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2605809 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2605810 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2605811 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2605812 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2605813 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2605814 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2605815 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2605816 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2605817 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2605818 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2605819 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2605820 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2605821 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2605822 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2605823 i liked him before but i dont see any integrity
2605824 the image of him and his wife was very important the image of that union
2605825 i have great things to say about john edwards he opened that window up for our rural community
2605826 it gave something to our community and our students and their families
2605827 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2605828 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2605829 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2605830 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2605831 shes fucking crazy what the hell is she talking about
2605832 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2605833 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2605834 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2605835 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2605836 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2605837 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2605838 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2605839 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2605840 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2605841 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2605842 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2605843 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2605844 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2605845 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2605846 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2605847 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2605848 you can stay w us next time youre playing in bellingham washington
2605849 consequence of economic growth and development untendered by adequate concern and conservation
2605850 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2605851 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2605852 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2605853 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2605854 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2605855 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2605856 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2605857 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2605858 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2605859 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2605860 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2605861 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2605862 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2605863 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2605864 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2605865 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2605866 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2605867 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2605868 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2605869 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2605870 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2605871 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2605872 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2605873 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2605874 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2605875 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2605876 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2605877 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2605878 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2605879 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2605880 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2605881 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2605882 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2605883 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2605884 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2605885 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2605886 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2605887 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2605888 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2605889 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2605890 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2605891 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2605892 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2605893 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2605894 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2605895 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2605896 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2605897 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2605898 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2605899 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2605900 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2605901 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2605902 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2605903 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2605904 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2605905 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2605906 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2605907 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2605908 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2605909 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2605910 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2605911 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2605912 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2605913 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2605914 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2605915 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2605916 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2605917 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2605918 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2605919 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2605920 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2605921 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2605922 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2605923 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2605924 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2605925 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2605926 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2605927 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2605928 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2605929 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2605930 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2605931 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2605932 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2605933 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2605934 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2605935 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2605936 georgia clash provides a lesson on the united states need for russia
2605937 real results by the end of my first term in office
2605938 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2605939 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2605940 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2605941 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2605942 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2605943 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2605944 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2605945 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2605946 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2605947 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2605948 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2605949 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2605950 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2605951 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2605952 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2605953 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2605954 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2605955 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2605956 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2605957 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2605958 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2605959 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2605960 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2605961 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2605962 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2605963 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2605964 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2605965 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2605966 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2605967 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2605968 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2605969 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2605970 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2605971 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2605972 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2605973 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2605974 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2605975 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2605976 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2605977 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
2605978 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
2605979 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
2605980 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
2605981 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
2605982 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
2605983 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
2605984 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
2605985 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
2605986 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2605987 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2605988 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2605989 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2605990 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2605991 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2605992 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2605993 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2605994 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2605995 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2605996 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2605997 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2605998 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2605999 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2606000 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
2606001 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2606002 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2606003 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2606004 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2606005 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2606006 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2606007 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2606008 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2606009 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2606010 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2606011 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2606012 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2606013 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2606014 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2606015 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2606016 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2606017 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2606018 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2606019 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2606020 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2606021 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2606022 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2606023 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2606024 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2606025 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2606026 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2606027 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2606028 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2606029 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2606030 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2606031 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2606032 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2606033 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2606034 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2606035 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2606036 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2606037 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2606038 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2606039 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2606040 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2606041 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2606042 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2606043 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2606044 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2606045 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2606046 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2606047 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2606048 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2606049 we know youre paying a little bit but if you dont pay this much every month well be forced to take legal action against you
2606050 a primeira vez que vi rocky foi no cinema ao final do filme voltei correndo para casa disposto a treinar at ser o melhor devo muito da minha carreira para aquela hist ria de vida e perseveran a
2606051 wow frango com lim o que seu telefone vai tocar
2606052 you packed up your life with no family and moved not many people can say they did that
2606053 hey everybody were the tap dancing fetuses and were gonna play
2606054 the extension works by simply adding our referral code to the url when you browse on amazon if you follow an amazon referral link from someone elses site this extension will not override their referral code
2606055 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2606056 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2606057 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2606058 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2606059 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2606060 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2606061 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2606062 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2606063 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2606064 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2606065 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2606066 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2606067 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2606068 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2606069 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2606070 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2606071 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2606072 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2606073 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2606074 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2606075 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2606076 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2606077 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2606078 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on nonuse of force with south ossetians
2606079 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2606080 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2606081 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2606082 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2606083 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2606084 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2606085 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2606086 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2606087 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2606088 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2606089 reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2606090 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2606091 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2606092 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2606093 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2606094 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2606095 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2606096 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2606097 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2606098 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2606099 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2606100 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2606101 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2606102 forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us
2606103 my little family has acquired the 2nd story dream that lives in the heart of every poor immigrant whos left everything behind to schlep it to this magnificent land
2606104 sshhh im trying to watch this quick go turn on all the faucets in the house before the pipes freeze up and explode killing us all with flying shrapnel in our sleep
2606105 do it now the woman on the tv just said hurry before i regret moving to this miserable fucking country even more than i already do
2606106 what the hell is a snow angel were muslim we dont believe in snow angels bundle up
2606107 so thats what those look like no wonder mom didnt want to do that it looks painful as hell
2606108 well just wait til you see what dumbass forgot to bring home
2606109 again ladies and gentlemen we dont know how long this winter storm will last but the highway patrol urges all residents in the metro area to remain indoors and stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary
2606110 residents are advised to stock up on groceries milk and bread items especially now before icy conditions make road travel even more dangerous keep your faucets on overnight
2606111 they on deck capital have higher interest rates but a shorter payoff period it turned out to be a good move because both studios are already turning a profit
2606112 im looking harder at things like the carrying capacity of a borrower because the overall economy has slowed to a point where its important to know what would happen if some of the customers stopped coming
2606113 the marketplace for commercial lending is as competitive as ever
2606114 not only do you have more banks but increased competition from credit unions and other lending sources
2606115 it is very important for a company to have its account receivables in order before applying for a loan
2606116 the further out someone is on paying their bill the harder it is to collect this is a good time to be aggressive on that front its important to be liquid have cash flow when the economy is slower
2606117 dont bother asking for exceptions because thats not going to happen
2606118 banks are looking at their portfolios and seeing that residential units arent selling right now the banks got the message and started looking in other areas
2606119 were not seeing the troubled credit issues locally that you hear about nationally and were seeing a lot of loan requests for commercial projects
2606120 this is period where business owners should be making decisions based on their specific situation because there are parts of the economy that are strong right now
2606121 its good to know whether your business is in a cyclical trend or is being impacted by a recession
2606122 for example june is always a slow month for us so i took that into account when making this decision
2606123 ive believed its easier to adapt to the clientele you have rather than going out and getting new clients
2606124 many of our clients were making changes to adapt to the economy and one of those changes was to drive less they are great customers and i didnt want to lose them
2606125 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2606126 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2606127 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2606128 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2606129 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2606130 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2606131 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2606132 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2606133 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2606134 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2606135 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2606136 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2606137 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2606138 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2606139 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2606140 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2606141 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2606142 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2606143 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2606144 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2606145 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2606146 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2606147 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2606148 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2606149 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2606150 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2606151 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2606152 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2606153 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2606154 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2606155 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2606156 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2606157 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2606158 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2606159 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2606160 were not going to allow these people to compound the tragedy of the mclean family loss and canadians simply wont tolerate these lunatics disrupting what should be a respectful service
2606161 entering canada by a u s citizen isnt an absolute right and if youre coming here only to disrupt the social order and to promote what we consider to be bordering on hate crimes or hate language they shouldnt come into canada
2606162 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2606163 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2606164 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2606165 i thank the lord there are people out there like you
2606166 sweetie idont want to die either but if its gods plan to take me at least i will go down fighting i will try everything possible even if the doctors cant save me maybe something they learn from me will help find the cure for someone else maybe that is what god meant for me
2606167 my doctor said i looked tired and he decided to run some routine blood work i anticipated it would say i was like usual a little anemic the blood work came back with an extremely high white cell count but he didnt want to worry me so he ordered a second cbc the results were not a fluke
2606168 i found myself just moments later that morning sitting in an oncologists office with my mother by my side unfortunately my wife dana was sadly sitting in another doctors office at the same time her obstetricians she would soon learn that she was having a miscarriage this would be our second loss we had been so blessed to have a beautiful 2 year old daughter isabella and we hoped that someday we would be able to provide her with a sibling to share her life with my mother and i were soon given the fateful news that i had chronic myelogenous leukemia cml by this time dana had joined us in the doctors office and we all cried together we were told that without treatment my life expectancy was 3 to 5 years

2606189 if we let this stand youre going to see the undoing of this society i didnt preside over this movie industry to see it disintegrate like the music industry

2606199 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2606200 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2606201 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2606202 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2606203 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2606204 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2606205 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2606206 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2606227 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was so mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the whole round
2606228 there could be a signing tomorrow after the leaders have met to thrash out the remaining issues
2606229 i think quite a number of western countries will want time to assess and review the outcome before committing themselves and will not simply listen to zanu pf or the mdcs versions of events
2606230 if they come on board and give the process a chance that will be good for the economy but if they dont zimbabwe will still face problems internationally
2606231 absinthe has a wonderful colour green a glass of absinthe is as poetical as anything in the world what difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset

2606306 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
2606307 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2606308 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2606309 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2606310 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2606311 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2606312 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2606313 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make

2606318 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
2606319 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2606320 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2606321 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2606322 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2606323 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2606324 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2606325 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2606326 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit

2606337 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2606338 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2606339 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2606340 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2606341 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2606342 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2606343 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2606344 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2606367 most of us have been unwilling to admit that we were alcoholics no person likes to think that he is bodily or mentally different from his fellows therefore it is not surprising that our drinking careers have been characterized by countless vain attempts to prove that we could drink like other people

2606419 i work in a restaurant i cant take off a whole shift to go sit in a caucus we need to all be on the same primary system why should 2 000 people in iowa have the same say as 2 million in pennsylvania
2606420 caucuses inherently disenfranchise the elderly disabled shift workers single parents and others whose circumstance prohibits participation in caucuses
2606421 allow party officials spouses employers or other aggressive participants to exert undue influence and coercion over voters
2606422 its time to eliminate caucuses from the presidential nomination process
2606423 our party is proud that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2606424 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2606425 they did a really bad thing to her the bias against her was so bad
2606426 this is not the way theyd talk about their wife or mother or daughter

2606434 this is not the way theyd talk about their wife or mother or daughter
2606435 its tough on everybody to have to wait around today at least i didnt get in the middle of a round and have to go back out
2606436 the forecast right now is generally much better than today hopefully dry
2606437 pace of play will be important well need to start on time and need to get everyone out on time
2606438 we should still have time even if theres a playoff for a three hole aggregate score playoff if need be but it will be tight
2606439 i cant believe it i have a chance for tomorrow and i have to wait but its great to be here
2606440 we did obviously try to get play resumed this afternoon
2606441 we had a couple of breaks where it looked like we had a possibility to play but both times cells built up again behind to the west so obviously we did not get out
2606442 yeah if it plays a little longer itll probably set up a little better for me
2606443 the greens are still pretty firm well see they have got 12 hours or so to work on the golf course and it needed a little bit of rain so well just see what happens
2606444 i think that every one of us can play we can play 36 holes
2606445 its going to be tough for us but it can be done its going to be more exhausting than anything
2606446 it would be akin to muddling plastic in the drink at ten bucks a pop the sangria is just not at all worth it
2606447 looks good in the dark perhaps its a good thing its dark
2606448 now i can click on yelp that this place is wheelchair accessible
2606449 wow guys this is a great way to give a pick up line
2606450 god that place looks so cute i should go there
2606451 medium rare but more to the rare side like south south west
2606452 maybe its five stars because my girl friend and i had a great time
2606453 nu ne temem de rapid ii respectam si ne vom juca sansa
2606454 not every place that calls itself a brewery actually brews beer
2606455 you cant afford it you cant afford it wanna lick psyche
2606456 very clever dinner appetizing food fit neatly into interesting round pie
2606457 the wagyu beef was so pricey that being tasty was less an accomplishment than a contractual obligation
2606458 this is the best steak i think i have ever had and yours is even better than mine
2606459 the chef tends to undercook you know something like that i have held off a few days before writing this review in hopes of changing my mind yeah that didnt work not really a fan
2606460 finger licking good taste that was unbelievable the onion rings the sugar snap peas and the mushrooms were all flavorful and cooked perfectly
2606461 icy cold as the doors open and youre all sweaty from grinding with that drunk chick
2606462 the floor and the ceiling probably cant stand another layer of brick cements weight
2606463 people in a city like fuzhou are pretty ignorant about any of the stuff i probably know more than anyone else in the city
2606464 my budget is roughly between 7 000 14 000 usd but material and construction certainly dont cost the same here as it does in the states so this budget carries different meaning here than in the states
2606465 get an adapter cable that will take that signal from the mackies 1 4
2606466 after a letter back from the ceo saying that he was sorry and embarrassed by the situation and that he was sure he wanted to work with me again and that they were about to have a meeting to figure out how to pay multiple debts that they owed
2606467 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2606468 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2606469 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2606470 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2606471 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2606472 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2606473 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was so mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the whole round
2606474 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2606475 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2606476 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2606477 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2606478 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2606479 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2606480 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2606481 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2606482 he looks like hes 25 hes got a huge game
2606483 im just going to go out and play my game and give it my best shot blumenherst said
2606484 im putting better than i was last year which is good
2606485 the only real difference that i might have kind of forgotten about last year was that it is 36 holes
2606486 i didnt hit the ball as well as i have been at the beginning my driver was going a little left and the rough was just so thick that it kind of can be a little trickier
2606487 i thought i played pretty well said lee who qualified for the 2008 u
2606488 it was really hard because i mean shes my best friend munoz said
2606489 it was really weird but i guess it is what it is we couldnt change who i was playing
2606490 i knew it was going to be a really hard match today because i knew she was playing awesome mozo said
2606491 i think shes really skillful and a really great player mozo said
2606492 she made it because her stroke is perfect i hope she can finish strong tomorrow
2606493 its going to take a lot of hard work from everyone on the team
2606494 that win at sonoma wasnt easy at all once the green flag falls youve just got to stick to your strategy and hope everything works out in your favor
2606495 you go out there and run as hard as you can to see what youve got
2606496 whether we win or whether we run out of gas just doesnt matter at this point weve got to win
2606497 its important especially for the first two or three races of the chase when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at
2606498 it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2606499 i dont know if either one of us has a lot to be proud of today
2606500 i think both of us will be looking to get some momentum in the morning hoping it will carry us through on whats going to be a long day
2606501 this isnt the ryder cup week we have three weeks to go i want a guy who is confident and if the guys confidence is shattered when he left here join the club
2606502 ive been tempted for a while especially with this horse to try american racing
2606503 i took the lead because i wanted to run my race
2606504 he quickened when i asked him to so i never saw what was happening behind me

2606509 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2606510 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge

2606544 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2606545 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2606546 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2606547 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2606548 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2606549 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2606550 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2606551 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2606552 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2606553 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2606554 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2606555 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2606556 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2606557 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2606558 you know the olympics opening ceremony would be a good time to smash them while the world looks the other way
2606559 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2606560 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2606561 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2606562 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2606563 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2606564 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
2606565 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines
2606566 i dont know what were going to do maybe well just have to give some of it back
2606567 i would not want to be cfo of a public company now
2606568 googles soc is a formal sponsorship program tailored specifically to open source
2606569 my primary role has changed from developing drupal web sites myself to consulting with large clients such as mtv sony bmg records bbc and popular science magazine that use drupal my job is to help train their developers help architect web sites mapping wireframes to drupal functionality and to impart best practices and advice that ive picked up from working in the drupal community over the past three years lullabot also gives us time built into our working schedule to work on drupal itself
2606570 an internship is a nice opportunity for both an employer and an employee to size each other up to see if theyd be a good match and real world experience will always trump anything you read in a book
2606571 ive been mostly self taught but i went to school to help fill in some of the gaps
2606572 one of my instructors ian macleod mentioned gsoc it sounded like a wonderful opportunity to me id had a love of open source basically since i first heard the term in the late 90s but i had always lacked the confidence to believe that i could be part of it to be able to get my foot in the door and to be paid to do it at the same time was basically a dream opportunity so i applied figuring what the heck
2606573 someone reading about gsoc might come away thinking the sole goal of the program is for open source organizations to use googles money to pay students to work on much neglected or much needed features
2606574 what a sweet deal however i believe gsoc is more about attracting and retaining talent to an open source project than it is about producing fantastic code
2606575 i would much rather have only semi fantastic code from a student who stays on with the project long term and gets involved in other aspects such as documentation and core development than a 100 working thing of beauty from a student who we never hear from again after gsoc is finished
2606576 students work on something fun that they enjoy and get paid to do it
2606577 it greatly lowers the barrier of entry to getting involved in an open source project
2606578 and if they cant help you they know someone else who can
2606579 its a great way to bug test your documentation to see if its easy for new people to get up to speed
2606580 potentially long term contributors get completely immersed and start taking on additional roles in the project since open source projects thrive on contributors the opportunity to obtain more of them is a huge benefit
2606581 working in open source effectively gives you an open resume
2606582 instead of taking you at your word your employer can actually look at your code and see its progression from when you first started on a project until now they can view your interactions with fellow community members and see how you can effectively solve problems in a team environment you demonstrate your ability to use collaboration tools necessary for serious software development
2606583 this program served to completely shatter the myths i had about how open source projects worked i thought everyone who works on open source is this enormous genius with a huge brain and is some sort of god of programming which paralyzed me from getting involved in open source for nearly 10 years
2606584 everyone contributes what they can whether its a starter solution a fantastic algorithm thatll blow your mind a confirmation that the change works on internet explorer 6 under windows xp or documentation that has proper grammar and sentence structure
2606585 suddenly i was collaborating with people in hungary germany and the united states
2606586 instead of smashing your face on the problem for three days mentors are available who will answer your question in five minutes realizing that its perfectly ok to ask questions and in fact encouraged was one of the hurdles i had to get over students also have the tendency to avoid committing projects until theyre so clean and shiny you can eat off them when i finally learned to commit early commit often i had fewer headaches and a lot more help
2606587 i chose to apply for the quiz module which allows people to use drupal to build web based quizzes and tally the results
2606588 one of the people i did contract work for was kieran lal who was with a drupal company called civicspace labs he had seen me actively participating in the drupal community and paid me to drive a couple of patches home and to write some gnarly technical documentation about the new form api that had just been added to drupal after this kind of test drive he ended up hiring me to work full time and that became my first drupal job in november 2005 three months after completing gsoc
2606589 last year i helped manage drupals participation in the google highly open participation contest which was a gsoc like program but for 13 to 18 year old students with a focus on short term tasks rather than two month long projects
2606590 berry was a ghop student who increased drupals automated test coverage by many orders of magnitude and is now working on the usability testing suite which will allow field testing of proposed user interface changes in order to get immediate feedback from users novak is a three time gsocer with drupal who is passionate about re tooling drupals feed aggregation system
2606591 lenders gsoc project was around an automated testing framework for drupal and he was hired by nowpublic a citizen journalism web site powered by drupal to help manage internal testing procedures several of our students have gone onto jobs within drupal shops and one at google itself
2606592 people often get jobs at companies like red hat with no previous relationship to the company however interning certainly can assist in opening doors and building relationships that lead to full time employment
2606593 there are related roles in engineering sales and marketing positions like these are available at red hat and candidates can review our careers site to find more information
2606594 this is often facilitated by the close relationship that red hat maintains with the
2606595 at red hat our new hires must have the basic skills we require to perform the job so while we dont offer on the job training we do offer opportunities to enhance core skills with additional training for example with our associate technical support engineer role new hires participate in six weeks of in house training and then sit for their red hat certified engineer certification which is paid for by red hat
2606596 we red hat have a three month intern program where interns work for specific departments and participate in cross functional projects the internship program delivers a robust exposure to open source
2606597 beyond that as a growing company and a leader in the open source community we look for entry level employees who can demonstrate an ability to scale with red hat
2606598 with regard to specific technical skills experience with linux up stream work java c c perl and python are big pluses
2606599 one approach for this is to seek additional education or certifications that are in high demand in the marketplace for people focused on an open source career a rhce certification could be a good opportunity
2606600 in the web 2 0 world building a strong network is critical to managing your career utilizing tools such as linkedin facebook and plaxo to build your professional network early in your college career is an important first step
2606601 also try to seek out skill enhancement opportunities that are aligned to your career goals
2606602 many college graduates are finding it difficult to enter the information technology world with little or no work experience

2606612 a equipe come ou bem mas estamos finalizando pouco a gol acho que equipe poderia ter um pouco mais de agressividade

2606627 apabila anaknya itu sampai umur yang membolehkan dia berusaha bersama dengannya berkata ibrahim wahai anak ku sesungguhnya aku melihat dalam mimpi bahawa aku akan menyembelihmu maka fikirkanlah apa pendapatmu anaknya menjawab wahai ayah jalankanlah apa yang diperintahkan kepadamu insya allah ayah akan dapati daku dari orang yang sabar
2606628 ingatlah peristiwa tatkala nabi yusuf berkata kepada bapanya wahai ayahku sesungguhnya aku mimpi melihat sebelas bintang dan matahari serta bulan aku melihat mereka tunduk memberi hormat kepadaku bapanya berkata wahai anakku janganlah engkau ce ritakan mimpimu kepada saudara saudaramu kerana aku khuatir mereka akan menjalankan sesuatu rancangan jahat terhadapmu sesungguhnya syaitan adalah musuh yang nyata bagi manusia dan demikianlah caranya tuhanmu memilihmu dan akan mengajarmu tabir mimpi serta akan menyempurnakan nikmat nya kepadamu dan kepada keluarga yaqub seba gaimana ia telah menyempurnakannya kepada datuk nenek mu dahulu ibrahim dan ishak sesungguhnya tuhanmu maha mengetahui lagi maha bijaksana
2606629 sesungguhnya allah membenarkan rasul nya dalam perkara mimpi itu dengan sebenarnya iaitu bahawa kamu akan memasuki masjid al haraam insya allah dengan aman mencukur kepalamu dan menggunting sedikit rambutnya serta kamu tidak merasa takut kerana ia mengetahui apa yang kamu tidak mengetahuinya maka ia sediakan sebelum itu satu kemenangan yang dekat
2606630 dan raja mesir berkata sesungguhnya aku mimpi melihat tujuh ekor lembu yang gemuk dimakan oleh tujuh ekor lembu yang kurus dan aku melihat tujuh tangkai biji bijian yang hijau dan tujuh tangkai lagi yang kering wahai ketua ketua kaum yang hadir terangkanlah kepadaku tentang mimpiku ini kalau kamu orang yang pandai mentabirkan mimpi mereka menjawab yang demikian itu ialah mimpi mimpi yang bercampur aduk dan kami bukanlah orang yang me ngetahui mimpi mimpi itu dan berkatalah orang yang terselamat di antara mereka yang berdua itu dan teringat akan yusuf sesudah beberapa waktu aku akan memberitahu kepada kamu akan orang yang pandai mentabirnya oleh itu hantarkanlah daku pergi kepadanya yusuf wahai orang yang benar tabirkanlah kepada kami tujuh ekor lembu yang gemuk dimakan oleh tujuh ekor lembu yang kurus dan tujuh tangkai biji bijian yang hijau dan yang lain kering supaya aku kembali kepada orang yang me ngutusku itu semoga mereka dapat mengetahui tabirnya yusuf menjawab hendaklah kamu bertanam tujuh tahun seperti biasa kemudian apa yang kamu ketam biarkanlah dia pada tangkai tangkai kecuali sedikit dari bahagian yang kamu jadikan untuk makan kemudian akan datang selepas itu tujuh tahun yang bersangatan kemaraunya yang akan menghabiskan makanan yang kamu sediakan bagi mereka kecuali sedikit dari apa yang kamu simpan untuk dijadikan benih kemudian akan datang pula sesudah itu tahun yang padanya orang ramai beroleh rahmat hujan dan padanya mereka dapat memerah hasil

2606647 when u s military bases in the restive sunni city of tikrit iraq first came under insurgent mortar attack five years ago american commanders sharply disagreed about how to respond screw brigade col nathan sassaman yelled during a mortar attack in august 2003 return fire now the tale of a renegade soldier ignoring a direct order from a higher ranking officer didnt come to light during a pentagon investigation or congressional probe it was relayed in a new book by col sassaman warrior king the school of thought led by gen david petreus with its focus on counterinsurgency tactics economic development and political reconciliation is currently ascendant but there is a small number of officers who think that the military has moved too far from its core competency fighting wars and they that the u s erred by not taking a hard enough approach in iraq the simple somewhat barbaric truth is that we had to convince the iraqi people that they should fear us more than they feared the insurgents col sassaman writes he says the military should have responded to insurgent attacks with heavy artillery and should have destroyed any building including private homes used by insurgents sassaman believes his former boss gen frederick rudesheim is an arrogant uncaring aloof officer who preferred to stay back in the comfort of his elegantly appointed office rather than accompanying troops on nighttime raids in his book he also argues that the golden dome in samarra a revered shiite shrine should have been demolished by u s forces when insurgents began using it as a base to fire rocket propelled grenades and machine guns
2606648 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2606649 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2606650 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2606651 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2606652 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2606653 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2606654 if excellence is a habit then we are what we repeatedly do
2606655 it seems like every year the majors are getting harder and harder
2606656 this year we have played in a lot of wind almost every week even a normal week on the tour we have played in a lot of wind
2606657 the open championship had winds stronger than the others and then weve had it tough again this week as well
2606658 i would definitely say this year is the toughest set of majors ive ever played
2606659 augusta wasnt easy and the u s open is never easy
2606660 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2606661 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2606662 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2606663 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2606664 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2606665 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2606666 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2606667 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2606668 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2606669 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2606670 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2606671 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2606672 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2606673 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2606674 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2606675 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2606676 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2606677 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2606678 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2606679 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2606680 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2606681 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2606682 treasurer wayne swan has already made clear were making it easier for people to switch loans so they can be there looking for the best possible deal
2606683 ive been running this race since i was 13 years old
2606684 third was my best coming into today and to win it is a dream come true for me
2606685 its the biggest race in australia and to be the first over the line is amazing
2606686 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2606687 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2606688 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2606689 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2606690 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2606691 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2606692 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2606693 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2606694 to ensure stability authorities have strengthened controls on non residents to root out trouble and stepped up controls on key people religious figures and trouble making petitioners to stay abreast of things
2606695 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2606696 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2606697 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2606698 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2606699 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2606700 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2606701 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2606702 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2606703 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2606704 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2606705 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2606706 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2606707 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2606708 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2606709 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2606710 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2606711 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2606712 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2606713 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2606714 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2606715 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2606716 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2606717 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2606718 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2606719 cheating on ones dying wife who just made political commercials re how wonderful you are is the height of slime
2606720 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2606721 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2606722 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2606723 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2606724 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2606725 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2606726 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2606727 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2606728 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2606729 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

2606732 i have to ask a question before i can give you an answer en espa ol
2606733 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2606734 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2606735 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2606736 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2606737 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2606738 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2606739 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2606740 debemos convertir este 23 de noviembre en otro 2 de diciembre
2606741 tenemos una excelente noticia para el pueblo de sucre y es que quedan apenas 105 d as para que este nefasto gobierno municipal termine lo que en 8 a os no han hecho que no pretendan venir a ofrecerlo ahora no al chantaje sucre se respeta aqu viene un gobierno para todos el pueblo le dice no al radicalismo y al sectarismo esto no lo para nadie
2606742 estamos en la encrucijada entre el continuismo el radicalismo el chantaje que significar a la tercera gesti n del candidato de rangel valos y la opci n de la pasi n por sucre del compromiso eterno con la gente la constancia y el orden que representamos nosotros simplemente quien se sienta conforme con el caos en que se encuentra el municipio que vote por el candidato impuesto por el oficialismo pero quien quiera un sucre ordenado seguro limpio y para todos aqu esta su gallo quien les habla el pr ximo alcalde de petare
2606743 en sucre el 80 de la gente no es due a de su casa vamos a impulsar un proceso de titularidad de tierras y urbanizaremos los barrios ya lo dijimos hace varias semanas modernizaremos el municipio y junto a los gobiernos nacional regional y metropolitano construiremos un sistema de metrocable en los sectores populares
2606744 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2606745 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2606746 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2606747 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2606748 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2606749 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2606750 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2606751 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2606752 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2606753 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2606754 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2606755 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2606756 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2606757 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2606758 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2606759 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2606760 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2606761 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2606762 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2606763 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2606764 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2606765 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2606766 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2606767 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2606768 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2606769 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2606770 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2606771 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2606772 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2606773 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2606774 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2606775 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2606776 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2606777 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2606778 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2606779 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2606780 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2606781 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2606782 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2606783 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2606784 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2606785 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2606786 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2606787 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2606788 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2606789 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2606790 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2606791 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2606792 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2606793 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2606794 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2606795 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2606796 who are open to doing something on the production side
2606797 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2606798 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2606799 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2606800 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2606801 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2606802 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2606803 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2606804 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2606805 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2606806 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2606807 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2606808 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2606809 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2606810 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2606811 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2606812 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2606813 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2606814 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2606815 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2606816 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2606817 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2606818 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2606819 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2606820 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2606821 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2606822 the degree to which commercial entities will go to disrupt a humanitarian project
2606823 this was a project that could operate outside the regular business world
2606824 and thats not an unreasonable expectation but it is in some ways threatening to businesses and when you threaten businesses especially very large ones they are going to react in ways that hurt you
2606825 he said that sort of thing privately to people i knew
2606826 there was a fair amount of that i was annoyed enough to say so and he apologised for it a lot of good that did
2606827 was not the how of computing but the why and the primary answer was learning
2606828 this was a very remote village no electricity no telephone no tv but the wi fi was so well done that when i asked myself if you look at the constituent parts they were all replicable and in most cases the prices would scale down
2606829 its crippling because like an suv most of the power in that machine is being used to drive the machine not you or i
2606830 its not working as well as it should because not enough people are connected at the moment
2606831 it was like you get married and then your girlfriend comes back
2606832 that intel viewed it quite as holistically as we did
2606833 but we came this close to not doing it i was advised by absolutely everybody to make it a profit making entity so we could make lots of money and then give it away but the non profit decision was important because it provided clarity of purpose first a head of state will talk to you because its about children and learning and not profit and secondly the best people will work for you for zero salary
2606834 he would go from prime minister meeting to president of country meeting and that was his sales model
2606835 and it didnt work absolutely not as we have learnt in the business world just because you have a handshake from the president or the prime minister it doesnt mean you have an order
2606836 it created enough hype and pictures of nicholas shaking hands with heads of state that back in taiwan where 250 engineers were working on it people felt part of something
2606837 it can take years to get a ui right so starting from scratch for me was a question
2606838 i left because the future of sugar was going to be bigger and bolder than just being confined to the olpc laptop
2606839 its hard to pinpoint a start date with the nature of ethnographic research in which ethnographers collect data over a long period of time
2606840 which is chartered to extend pc access to the worlds next billion users
2606841 that they waited until very late in the day to make it nearly impossible for olpc representatives on the east coast to get their side of the story in the first stories
2606842 if nicholas hadnt said what he said in january 05
2606843 this machine wouldnt be here and a lot of other technologies and discussions wouldnt be here he accelerated people getting access by probably years
2606844 they could keep on coming up with innovations and license out the technology take the money and fund olpc or they could open source the entire design of the computer

2606848 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2606849 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2606850 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2606851 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2606852 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2606853 y el final del siglo xviii y comienzos del xix vio en europa y en am rica la revoluci n tan ansiada igualdad libertad y fraternidad fue su lema pero la burgues a y el pueblo ve an cada uno a su manera el enfrentamiento con el clero y la nobleza aquellos que trataban de consolidar definitivamente el mercado ve an la igualdad como un principio legal la misma justicia para todos los otros la estimaban como el derecho a re r vivir comer y gozar como tambi n lo hac an los cl rigos y nobles y como lo hac an los ricos si no se debe obedecer a alguien por el mero hecho de que sea un notable de la iglesia o un noble por qu obedecer a alguien que meramente es rico los partidarios del mercado consideraban la libertad como aquello que les capacitaba para poder intercambiarse los derechos de propiedad de las cosas sin ning n tipo de limitaci n o intromisi n los otros ve an la libertad como el derecho a hablar a expresarse a organizarse los unos ve an la fraternidad como el resultado colectivo de su buen hacer individual los otros ve an en la fraternidad el final de la pobreza la solidaridad la cooperacion es l gico que unos y otros no se entendieran y todo acabara en sangre la de los otros fundamentalmente
2606854 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2606855 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2606856 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2606857 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2606858 leading indicators for an above normal season during 2008 include the continuing multi decadal signal atmospheric and oceanic conditions that have spawned increased hurricane activity since 1995 and the lingering effects of la ni a
2606859 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
2606860 it is critical that everyone know the risk for your area and have a plan to protect yourself your family and your property or to evacuate if requested by local emergency managers be prepared throughout the remainder of the hurricane season
2606861 even people who live inland should be prepared for severe weather and flooding from a tropical storm or a hurricane

2606865 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2606866 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2606867 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private

2606875 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all

2606901 cyprus is participating in the beijing olympiad in a spirit of fair play and at the same time is fighting for reunification peace and friendship for its people greek cypriots and turkish cypriots
2606902 the most valuable medal for us which we want is the medal of peace
2606903 our flag has been hoisted at the olympic village and this lifts our hearts because we are at a place where peace cooperation friendship and solidarity among people lauds and solidarity is what cyprus needs
2606904 an excellent spectacle which presented chinese history and culture and the olympic torch was lit in a memorable manner
2606905 the primary objective is for our athletes to qualify for the finals in the sport they are competing in i wish them all good luck
2606906 although it is the aim of all of us to promote the spirit of noble competition through the whole presence and participation of cypriot athletes in the beijing olympiad
2606907 we believe we can achieve this in the chinese capital
2606908 i am certain that the cypriot athletes will compete with self confidence and athletic spirit in beijing and do their best to honor cyprus
2606909 cyprus now has very modern facilities and infrastructure for the training of our athletes and the state is trying to the extent of its financial capabilities to offer our athletes everything necessary for their further progress

2606931 this is another example of states being two steps ahead of the federal government with the white house and gop leadership continuing to block environmental bills states are being forced to come up with their own plans
2606932 instead of wasting time debating offshore drilling plans that are opposed by the public and which will do nothing to solve our energy problems the ocean action plan wisely promotes renewable offshore energy and ecosystem based management to ensure our ocean are being administered responsibly and protected for future generations
2606933 the plan echoes calls for a commitment to our oceans through an ocean trust fund and regional ocean management federal legislation i introduced last year would create a trust fund to provide support for regional plans exactly like the one introduced on tuesday
2606934 im proud to represent the peaceful values of the central coast were lucky enough to live in communities that are aware of whats going on overseas and care about the fate of others
2606935 groups like peace action do a great job bringing a message of peace to congress and its a message many of my colleagues need to hear
2606936 five years after the beginning of the iraq war the united states desperately needs to make a fundamental change of course in foreign policy
2606937 ultimately its an active and vocal public that will determine if the country makes the profound changes in u s foreign policy we need
2606938 our military has unfortunately been forced to take on many roles it is not suited for from diplomat to nation building this civilian response corps will shift the burden of stabilization and reconstruction to civilian experts where it should have rested all along
2606939 usaid and the state department dont have the resources they need and this response corps will go a long way toward restoring their capabilities
2606940 stabilization and reconstruction is a mission that civilians must lead
2606941 but for too long our civilians have not had the capacity to lead and investments were not made to prepare them to lead

2606970 cyprus now has very modern facilities and infrastructure for the training of our athletes and the state is trying to the extent of its financial capabilities to offer our athletes everything necessary for their further progress
2606971 but i try whenever possible to keep myself informed about development in sports and especially football from newspapers and television
2606972 knowledge is just opinion that you trust enough to act upon
2606973 no properly written program should require more than 128k of ram
2606974 a properly designed system didnt need any anti virus or anti spyware software
2606975 but then the machine isnt a pc anymore its a computing resource 100 managed by an it department
2606976 i saw a post the other day im not sure where otherwise id cite it that proclaimed that a properly designed system didnt need any anti virus or anti spyware software
2606977 you just paid 650 for this vulgar thing heres your receipt
2606978 this file that just got dumped in your browsers file cache its got this exploit in it
2606979 to see the dancing bunnies turn off your anti virus use the password showmethebunnies to unzip the attachment and run sucker
2606980 you are avoiding the real issue which is that the os network services and common applications like outlook are the entry points for malicious things that get in despite normal responsible use
2606981 flicking the voltage level switch on the back of your computer will double its performance
2606982 there has to become a point where the user realises that they are having to jump through too many hoops and what they are doing is wrong
2606983 i still hold that any child processes of an internet application web browser email client news reader whatever should be run with reduced privileges
2606984 consider the sysadmin of a large corporation whose networks contain data sensitive enough to warrant an intelligent determined attacker banks credit card companies governments etc theres no virus signature or spyware definition for his code what is he to do
2606985 arent you glad it found it before it could do any damage
2606986 no bill gates does not have an email tracking program and he is not reading your email and no i wouldnt count on him sending you a check later on
2606987 a good range of new age books self help material plus other esoterica
2606988 they have artwork for sale used to be original artwork it looks like mostly lithographs now a large kids section and great events throughout the week amp weekend
2606989 step into the 1920s at this last vestige of what used to be booksellers row owner leonard bernstein who took the reins from his father 30 years ago is a bookseller of the old stripe complete with fleet street mustache and paisley tie customers like to see the blood sweat and tears of a small bookstore
2606990 a big store with a huge selection of catholic books of every kind
2606991 this store has a good selection of books in spanish kids and adults fiction and non fiction spanish originals and in translation imported from south america and spain prices not too cheap but not out of line for imported goods
2606992 its a good clean well stocked used store along the lines of brand books in glendale
2606993 odium is in a word extreme odium is a store specializing in the darkest nature of humanity categories include celebrity scandals true crime witchcraft deviant sex amp filth crazy christians death philosophy black power fascist studies conspiracy satanism ufos and the most complete charles manson amp manson family collection to date
2606994 its hardly more than a corridor from the back room of aroma cafe to the bookstores own garden but in that elegant little space they have an excellent selection of literature much of it commented by the stores very engaged and engaging staff as well as cookbooks handsome photography books a number of self help and psychology tomes a lovingly tended poetry section and a nook for children complete with touchable toys many a parent parks their child there while browsing
2606995 why the colon in the title i dont know out of print scarce rare hardbacks well organized and maintained
2606996 because he believed a colon was the proper punctuation to be used for the abbreviation of given names this was the way samuel johnson used to sign his name
2606997 a funky store to add to your list they carry unusual books on all sorts of subjects the store also has an art gallery tons of postcards toys neat stuff around the corner from skylight bookshop
2606998 new used rare out of print books on dada amp surrealism cinema acting music drama buddhism kerouac amp the beat poetry philosophy religion modern art amp world literature
2606999 the largest computer book selection of the chain stores including quite a bit of professional software engineering 2 bookcases while they dont have as much as opamp they are much more convenient for many people because of location and late hours
2607000 terrific for childrens books the store has recently doubled its space so theres more room for strollers the staff is friendly knowledgeable and ready to please they do everything from helping people select books to start a classroom or preschool library to book fairs it is very rare that they dont have a book in stock the childrens art book collection is superb i am an art docent at our local school so i know whats available on the market
2607001 there is a good deli down the street to relax in after youve bought your books and baskin robbins across the street
2607002 another fairly large catholic bookstore though much smaller than cotters
2607003 arguably the most inviting used book store in all of l a county l a times
2607004 a very serious academic christian bookstore one of the best in the western us for theology and biblical studies they have barths church dogmatics on the shelf
2607005 id just like to say that of the thirty or so used book shops i visit in southern california this is my favorite the one if i had my choice that id most like to own it has a large selection of titles both hard cover and paperback its books have a relatively rapid turnover rate it is located in a fairly well patronized central business district it offers free parking in a nearby building it has floors covered by carpets and attractive shelving its owner and employees seem to like books and its sound system provides classical music to soothe the soul
2607006 brand books is an old time favorite clean well lighted with a good turn over of stock ive been going there for a good five years the owner seems to favor buying books as long as he needs that particular stock with the notion that if he doesnt buy from a person now when he doesnt need stock then when he does that person may not come back to sell brand has a very solid poetry section european and american history are standouts as well the philosophy section could use shoring up from time to time but still all major titles seem to be covered his general lit and fiction section is likewise well stocked prices are modest ive seen higher book quality is generally good staff is always helpful the owner jerome is charming to talk with highly recommended
2607007 a good range of new age books self help material plus other esoterica
2607008 they had a number of readings and signings coming up but i dont know if this is regular practice or just part of their grand opening they have new books and remainders a small selection of international newspapers and a cappucino espresso machine
2607009 i think of it as a smaller version of duttons
2607010 near the pier in hermosa beach used hardcover and paperback books unalphabetized
2607011 its not huge but it is enjoyable and i have found several excellent books on their 25 cent table ive also found pleasant surprises in their very small foreign books section very unpredictable
2607012 a good range of new age books self help material plus other esoterica
2607013 a lot of books but they are very poorly alphabetized and to a lesser degree categorized you must check bags at the front desk
2607014 i find this store always to have an exceptional collection of nonfiction books especially in americana and us history i have found many books there after fruitless searches through dozens of other stores
2607015 large selection of used hardbacks and paperbacks no particular specialization books are alphabetized by subject manager owns a parrot adept at mimicry
2607016 a rather small shop with not a huge variety of books but fairly well organized
2607017 a good range of new age books self help material plus other esoterica
2607018 ojai is a beautiful area it was shangri la in the film
2607019 sorry this special offer may not be applied to your account
2607020 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2607021 this is really almost suffocating so its a matter of staying really relaxed and not panicking in the conditions were just saying breathe all the way down the track breathe breathe
2607022 you see some of the europeans with a pink face so theyre struggling with it a bit which is a nice thing to see
2607023 if you have a loss on fund shares which paid tax exempt interest you cannot deduct a loss up to the amount of interest earned on shares held six months or less
2607024 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2607025 a study 1975 1989 showed that portfolios that finished the first five years in the top quintile were actually the least likely to finish in the top half over the next five years
2607026 of the 50 top performing funds in 2000 not a single one appeard on the list in either 1999 or 1998
2607027 using past performance numbers as a method for choosing mutual funds is such a lousy idea that mutual fund companies are required by law to tell you it is a lousy idea
2607028 the enemy of a good plan is the search for a perfect plan
2607029 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2607030 i surrender all i surrender all all to jesus my precious savior i surrender all
2607031 ive had enough i havent surrendered all but now im going to
2607032 whom have i in heaven but you and besides you i desire nothing on earth my flesh and my heart may fail but god is the strength of my heart and portion forever

2607034 im gonna make up for my size by being a complete cunt
2607035 it seems like every year the majors are getting harder and harder
2607036 this year we have played in a lot of wind almost every week even a normal week on the tour we have played in a lot of wind
2607037 the open championship had winds stronger than the others and then weve had it tough again this week as well
2607038 i would definitely say this year is the toughest set of majors ive ever played
2607039 its less than ten minutes no have a glass of water
2607040 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2607041 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2607042 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2607043 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2607044 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2607045 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2607046 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2607047 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2607048 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2607049 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2607050 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2607051 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2607052 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2607053 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2607054 ii dont kno i wanted to have the last laugh
2607055 men wut da f k y yu textiin when yu talkin to me men yu know i dont liike that hi
2607056 im certain that hugh morris managing director of the england team had long ago addressed what would happen if michael vaughan or paul collingwood were to go as captains of the test and one day teams
2607057 there was nothing frantic about last weekends response to michaels resignation hugh peter moores and geoff miller the national selector just needed to be certain michael had really thought through what he was doing
2607058 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2607059 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person
2607060 the plastic safety net the reality behind debt in america
2607061 shes so lucky shes a star but she cries cries cries in her lonely heart
2607062 converting it to inr it goes to 2 83 09 657 wow that was huge
2607063 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2607064 we are hearing from more and more prospective buyers that they want to find a house closer to their jobs
2607065 we formed a group we got a lawyer we did everything we could to fight it but the suncor people kept assuring us there wouldnt be any problems and by god they were right
2607066 maybe once or twice catching a little whiff that smells like bread baking
2607067 the only problem i have with it is that its ugly when you see it on the horizon
2607068 but we already have so many plants like that one more doesnt make that much difference
2607069 when its bad its really off the scale bad you dont want to experience it trust me
2607070 when we were first approached there was concern it would be like the plant in chatham which is very odorous its not people friendly
2607071 since its been in operation to my knowledge council has had no complaints
2607072 we try to keep as much public access as possible to our waterfront here
2607073 in my point of view thats where these places belong in an industrial area

2607084 i just buy the potato flakes they taste just as good
2607085 a lot of things about it just didnt seem right
2607086 los altos niveles de violencia y el aumento de los asesinatos bajo la modalidad del sicariato demuestran que no existe una pol tica de parte del estado para luchar contra el crimen organizado
2607087 o no sh t want me to let yu go
2607088 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2607089 a brought it over to a pile of sandbags underneath the drive through teller area of the bank
2607090 teleconferences which was a guided imagery session with and i managed to go 4th dimensional for a few seconds
2607091 hey bro she didnt pour this right can you get me another one
2607092 ill pour another one but its going to come out the same
2607093 the city of tskhinvali no longer exists there is nothing left it was wiped out by the georgian military
2607094 our losses are mounting as many as 40 military servicemen killed and over 100 wounded
2607095 the losses are also mounting among civilian population in the cities
2607096 frankly we have not expected the russian invaders to hit our residential buildings to hit our peaceful cities to hit our peaceful citizens
2607097 from the legal point of view our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate
2607098 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are a crime of course primarily a crime against their own people
2607099 this aggression led to numerous casualties among civilians in particular and virtually caused a real humanitarian catastrophe and that is already a crime against the ossetian people
2607100 at the same time i would like to stress that georgia has always been greatly respected in russia and georgians regarded as brotherly people
2607101 we have managed to down 10 russian jets and one of the pilots has been captured alive and is being treated in a military hospital
2607102 we have also destroyed up to 30 russian tanks and heavy military vehicles
2607103 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2607104 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2607105 is not about south ossetia it has never been in the first place it is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace freedom and liberty
2607106 this unprovoked long time ago planned invasion and aggression must stop
2607107 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2607108 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2607109 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2607110 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2607111 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2607112 we chose the chicago blackhawks logo as the best in the nhl because it represents everything this competition is about it is instantly recognizable has universal appeal and has inspired countless imitations the logo itself has an unwavering sense of pride and duty to it and looks great on a jersey or a hat it is truly one of the classics in all of sport
2607113 its not a big truck its a series of tubes
2607114 si me olvidare de ti oh jerusal m pierda mi diestra mi destreza y mi lengua se pegue a mi paladar si de ti no me acordare si no enalteciere a jerusal m como preferente asunto de mi alegr a

2607119 he aqu que yo extiendo sobre ella paz como un r o y la gloria de las naciones como torrente de aguas y vendr n a ti humillados los hijos de los que te afligieron y a las pisadas de tus pies se encorvar n todos los que te escarnec an y te llamar n ciudad de dios tzi n del santo de israel yo har que seas gloria eterna el gozo de todos los siglos
2607120 por amor a tzi n no callar y por amor a jerusal m no descansar hasta que salga como resplandor su justicia y su salvaci n se encienda como una antorcha y ser s corona de gloria en la mano de eterno y diadema de reino en la mano de tu dios
2607121 sobre tus muros oh jerusal m he puesto guardas todo el d a y toda la noche no callar n jam s los que os acord is de hasem no repos is ni le d is tregua hasta que restablezca jerusal m y la ponga por alabanza en la tierra
2607122 hasem jur por su mano derecha y por su poderoso brazo que jam s dar tu trigo por comida a tus enemigos ni beber n los extra os el vino que es fruto de tu trabajo
2607123 me d cuenta de que algo no iba bien mi sonrisa fallaba mi comunicaci n era escasa y mala y mi negativismo hac a mella en m bastantes veces me estaba volviendo egoista me centraba siempre en poder hacer ganar acumular sin preocuparme lo que otros pudieran estar haciendo hasta darme cuenta de que me estaba canibalizando a m mismo me encontraba en un c rculo vicioso en el que no pod a salir hasta que algo hizo que me importaran muy poco las personas y mucho las cosas hasta que cierto d a mi pensamiento cambi gracias a que me hab an robado me quitaron mis cosas y mis pertenencias en un viaje de placer me quitaron todo y mi desnudez temporal me hizo comprender que vestirme de buenos pensamientos y generar positivismo personal deber a ser un buen comienzo as es como comprend que mi barca se hund a si no hac a algo por construir algo positivo y mejoraba como persona
2607124 alegrar hoy mi vida y la de los dem s

2607128 india sparkles in areas where one might not expect but stumbles in the basics like the math genius who can give the definition of pi to the 999th decimal point but is unable to tie her own shoes
2607129 uniquely indian practice that can roughly be understood as a solutions oriented entrepreneurial attitude calling on any conceivable means to reach the desired end

2607145 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2607146 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2607147 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2607148 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2607149 i can no longer afford this house and need to sell before i default
2607150 it was very difficult for the players to move on that quickly we only had three hours to deal with everything
2607151 the players called their parents we were supposed to have a technical meeting but we didnt do it i gave them time to speak to their families
2607152 it was difficult to deal with it was the first time in my life that i had to deal with something like that before a game
2607153 voc est segurando uma hist ria e uma vida nas m os filho assim que as pessoas conhecem outras pessoas com hist rias que se transformam em vida e vidas que se tornam hist ria

2607158 hes a guy that ive grown up playing against and had a good rapport with so its an interesting coincidence to have two territory footballers playing milestone games
2607159 but if we can get over the line then that does give us a chance
2607160 i can only smile and be proud of my effort its not the final moment but the experience that matters
2607161 i thought the scores were a little low i think the judges need to reward someone who pays attention to the smallest of things
2607162 com a greve dos roteiristas demorou demais para isto come ar a andar e o escritor roger avary tinha um compromisso na fila antes de wolfenstein mas entrei em contato recentemente e ele est trabalhando no roteiro agora mesmo acho que em se tratando de progresso est um pouco mais lento do que esper vamos voc n o pode controlar as greves e tudo mais
2607163 i grew up with the mind set that after work you go to dinner and watch a movie
2607164 i dont want to go to a club and not wear panties
2607165 most other olympics acquired their label during or after the games usually after emotions had coalesced or a big news event pushed other stories off the front page but the combination of fascination with china and increasingly intense churn of media attention has changed that
2607166 how have you been papa its so good to see you
2607167 excuse me maam papa seems to be a bit cold could you find him a sweater or something
2607168 gee daddy warbucks i bet you are really glad to see your son
2607169 i know its been quite a while perhaps even a year since i last came to visit
2607170 daddy warbucks is dead and i just put a sweater on him
2607171 jeane was very clear with me that if she was ever found dead of an apparent suicide i was to make sure that all the evidence was publicly disseminated so that it could be independently evaluated
2607172 copies of any and all records including without limitation police reports and photographs related to the investigation of the death of deborah jeane palfrey on may 1 2008 at redacted tarpon springs florida this request includes copies of every document related to the matter regardless of the format in which the information is stored i note that information stored on a computer is as much a public record as a written page in a book or stored in a filing cabinet
2607173 fully investigate and reveal the circumstances of her death if deemed a suicide by authorities
2607174 while i dont mean to cause jeanes family additional grief an attorneys first duty is to his client and jeane was very clear with me that if she was ever found dead of an apparent suicide i was to make sure that all the evidence was publicly disseminated so that it could be independently evaluated
2607175 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2607176 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2607177 he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2607178 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2607179 he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

2607181 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2607182 he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2607183 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2607184 he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2607185 lo que les sucede a los mapuche sus problemas sus triunfos o derrotas me afecta nos afecta estoy convencido de que nos necesitamos mutuamente y a muchos otros para cambiar esta sociedad y hacer juntos una nueva historia
2607186 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2607187 had no reason to be more optimistic today than we were yesterday
2607188 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2607189 i dont think there will be any continuation of discussions on the statement the positions are too far apart
2607190 the pullout of georgian troops is the most important thing
2607191 to go as soon as possible to the region to propose to the parties concerned some elements to get out of the crisis
2607192 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia the re establishment of the situation that existed before
2607193 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2607194 the future world order is to be decided today in georgia
2607195 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to us 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
2607196 what we see here is not just a confrontation of minor republics but probably the confrontation between i am sorry to say that moscow and the entire west because now russia is basically protecting its clients and its own citizens up to 80 per cent of south ossetian population have russian passports
2607197 german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier was trying to solve the abkhazian conflict he proposed money to be allocated in the west in order to rebuild the infrastructure of this separatist republic but it didnt work because sides do not accept european mediators any more thats because the eu is politically too weak in the caucasus the eu has no real economic interests in the region and it has no armed forces there it failed in the past 16 years to develop some kind of co operation with russia and georgia or to join the peacekeeping missions in the region
2607198 several russian peacekeepers have been killed and that has greatly increased the stakes in the conflict because a few weeks ago president medvedev personally called mikhail saakashvili and asked him to refrain from using force against russian peacekeepers and the worst has happened the georgians killed russian peacekeepers in south ossetia and it is an attack not only against south ossetia its an attack against russia
2607199 be leader of stability and security on the entire territory of the former ussr
2607200 global ideological confrontation has been replaced by a struggle for spheres of interest in geopolitics
2607201 it is extremely important that all those involved show restraint and play their part in bringing about a political solution
2607202 it is important that the parties in conflict quickly start to communicate so as to put an end to the use of violence
2607203 for the georgian people this is really a sign of strong solidarity with them
2607204 its one thing to know it its another thing to see it
2607205 the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia must be respected
2607206 only the russian media and one ukrainian channel have been filming in the breakaway republic no western camera crews have been working in the conflict zone
2607207 the president of the united states and putin discussed the situation
2607208 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2607209 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2607210 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2607211 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2607212 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2607213 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2607214 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2607215 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2607216 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2607217 weve pretty much given up on the idea of issuing any kind of statement at this point
2607218 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2607219 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2607220 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
2607221 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2607222 nobody ever will defy russian rule in this part of the world
2607223 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia and the re establishment of the situation that existed before
2607224 this is a 100 per cent unprovoked brutal russian invasion and aggression into a sovereign country
2607225 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2607226 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2607227 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2607228 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2607229 our unomig military observers report ongoing military preparation by the abkhaz de facto authorities for a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2607230 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2607231 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2607232 the georgians have made an offer of a cease fire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2607233 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2607234 there is great dispute and controversy about the origins of this including prior mobilization of russian troops on the other side of the georgian border
2607235 we didnt know the president was here until after the game but it was great for him to come and support us

2607321 toda consideraci n de la violencia en el plano social debe tomar en cuenta primero que puede haber violencia tanto por parte de los que apoyan el r gimen establecido como de los que lo atacan y segundo que ser la justicia de las respectivas posiciones lo nico que permitir resolver cuando hay una violencia reprobable y cuando hay un uso leg timo de la fuerza

2607349 los elementos de juicio referidos en el fundamento s ptimo de la sentencia de alzada letras g h i y j constituyen un conjunto de presunciones judiciales que apreciados en conciencia son suficientes para dar por establecido que a v ctor ancalaf le ha correspondido una participaci n de autor de los hechos acontecidos el 17 de marzo de 2002 que tipifica el delito terrorista contemplado en el art 2 n 4 de la ley 18 314 en relaci n con el art 1 del mismo texto legal por haber intervenido en su ejecuci n de una manera inmediata y directa
2607350 que los incendios de los camiones y retroexcavadora se encuentran circunscritos dentro del conflicto pehuenche
2607351 las acciones desplegadas en aquella ocasi n evidencian que la forma m todos y estrategias empleadas ten an una finalidad dolosa de causar un estado de temor generalizado en la zona situaci n que es p blica y notoria y que estos jueces no pueden desatender se trata de un grave conflicto entre parte de la etnia mapuche y el resto de la poblaci n el il cito est inserto en un proceso de recuperaci n de tierras del pueblo mapuche el que se ha llevado a efecto por v as de hecho sin respetar la institucionalidad y legalidad vigente recurriendo a acciones de fuerza previamente planificadas concertadas y preparadas por grupos radicalizados que buscan crear un clima de inseguridad inestabilidad y temor en la provincia de malleco puesto que la mayor cantidad de sucesos y tambi n los m s violentos han ocurrido precisamente en comunas de esta jurisdicci n estas acciones se pueden sintetizar en la formulaci n de exigencias desmedidas hechas bajo presi n por grupos violent stas a los due os y propietarios a quienes se les amenaza y presiona para que accedan a los requerimientos que se les formulan muchas de estas condiciones se han materializado mediante ataques a la integridad f sica en acciones de robo hurto incendio da o y usurpaci n que han afectado tanto a las personas y bienes de diversos propietarios agr colas y forestales de sta zona del pa s
2607352 todo ste actuar il cito se encuadra dentro de un contexto que forma parte de una serie de acciones il citas que han tenido como objetivo atacar a un sector determinado de la poblaci n con el fin de causarles temor de ser v ctimas de atentados similares atendida la naturaleza y efectos de los medios empleados tanto como por la evidencia de que los hechos obedecen a un plan premeditado siendo ste sector de la poblaci n el formado por todos los propietarios sean empresas forestales agricultores y peque os parceleros vecinos o colindantes a comunidades mapuches donde existen grupos que buscan la reivindicaci n de dichas tierras en forma violenta o propietarios cuyos predios son declarados en conflicto unilateralmente por estos mismos grupos violentos
2607353 el hecho descrito precedentemente tanto por la naturaleza y efectos de los medios empleados se desarrolla dentro de un contexto destinado a producir un justo temor en un grupo determinado de la poblaci n de ser v ctima de atentados similares adquiriendo en consecuencia el delito de la especie el car cter de terrorista
2607354 es la voluntad individual de una minor a de propietarios la que decidir libremente y sin trabas sobre el empleo y destino de los bienes que la naturaleza ha puesto a disposici n de todos los hombres
2607355 colocar lanzar o disparar bombas o artefactos explosivos o incendiarios de cualquier tipo que afecten o puedan afectar la integridad f sica de personas o causar da o
2607356 cualquier definici n de terrorismo que se quiera enunciar debe necesariamente contener el concepto de desprecio a la vida humana propia o ajena concepto que no resulta del contenido de los hechos que se relataron en la audiencia
2607357 que del citado precepto se puede concluir que los verbos rectores son colocar lanzar o disparar se entiende por colocar el poner una cosa en un determinado lugar lanzar significa arrojar impeler con violencia una cosa de modo que recorra una distancia movida del impulso que ha recibido resulta as que los incendios de los veh culos se llevaron a efecto a lo menos colocando sin descartar su lanzamiento de artefactos incendiarios lo que origin los incendios cuyo objetivo y lo prohibido en este delito es la acci n de prender fuego a una cosa ajena para destruirla o deteriorarla lo que importa una noci n de peligro pudiendo afectar la integridad f sica de las personas y causando da o siendo el bien jur dico protegido la integridad f sica de las personas y la propiedad p blica o privada y si bien stos son los bienes atacados directamente afectan tambi n bienes jur dicos m s trascendente que son el orden y seguridad p blica

2607360 la reconstrucci n de la naci n mapuche y ha adoptado una estrategia de control territorial
2607361 testimonios pericias y evidencias son antecedentes que llevan a estos sentenciadores a tener por acreditados los hechos que fundamentaron la acusaci n tipificando en sus respectivos casos el incendio a la casa habitaci n del fundo nancahue el incendio forestal al fundo san gregorio y las amenazas proferidas a los due os y administradores de esos predios como conductas terroristas toda vez que las acciones que originaron esos il citos evidencian que la forma m todos y estrategias empleadas ten an una finalidad dolosa de causar un estado de temor generalizado en la zona situaci n que es p blica y notoria y que estos jueces no pueden desatender se trata de un grave conflicto entre parte de la etnia mapuche y el resto de la poblaci n hecho que no fue discutido ni desconocido por los intervinientes
2607362 en efecto los il citos antes se alados est n insertos en un proceso de recuperaci n de tierras del pueblo mapuche el que se ha llevado a efecto por v as de hecho sin respetar la institucionalidad y legalidad vigente recurriendo a acciones de fuerza previamente planificadas concertadas y preparadas por grupos radicalizados que buscan crear un clima de inseguridad inestabilidad y temor en diversos sectores de la octava y novena regiones
2607363 es obvio inferir que la finalidad perseguida es provocar en la gente un justo temor de ser v ctima de atentados similares y con ello obligar a los due os para que desistan de seguir explotando sus propiedades y hacer que las abandonen
2607364 para convicci n del tribunal se encuentran acreditados los elementos del tipo penal exigidos por el art culo 7 de la ley 18
2607365 el incendio que afect al fundo poluco pidenco el 19 de diciembre de 2001 es precisamente una conducta terrorista toda vez que las acciones desplegadas en aquella ocasi n evidencian que la forma m todos y estrategias empleadas ten an una finalidad dolosa de causar un estado de temor generalizado en la zona situaci n que es p blica y notoria y que estos jueces no pueden desatender se trata de un grave conflicto entre parte de la etnia mapuche y el resto de la poblaci n hecho que no fue discutido ni desconocido por los intervinientes
2607366 los incendios de los camiones y retroexcavadora se encuentran circunscritos dentro del conflicto pehuenche en la octava regi n sector cordillerano denominado alto bio bio lo que se relaciona con la oposici n a la construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco donde adem s es de p blico conocimiento que las hermanas berta y nicolasa quintrem n calp n son las que se oponen al proyecto de endesa porque sus terrenos ser n inundados con la construcci n de la central y en los cuales se encuentran sus ancestros sus or genes su cultura y sus tradiciones las acciones il citas antes referidas se han llevado a efecto por v as de hecho sin observar la institucionalidad y legalidad vigente recurriendo a acciones de fuerza previamente planificadas concertadas de acuerdo como acontecieron los hechos lugar y modus operandi con la finalidad de crear situaciones de inseguridad inestabilidad y temor infundiendo miedo para la formulaci n bajo presi n delictual de peticiones a las autoridades imponi ndole exigencias para lograr sus fines
2607367 todo ste actuar il cito se encuadra dentro de un contexto que forma parte de una serie de acciones il citas que han tenido como objetivo atacar a un sector determinado de la poblaci n con el fin de causarles temor de ser v ctimas de atentados similares atendida la naturaleza y efectos de los medios empleados tanto como por la evidencia de que los hechos obedecen a un plan premeditado siendo ste sector de la poblaci n el formado por todos los propietarios sean empresas forestales agricultores y peque os parceleros vecinos o colindantes a comunidades mapuches donde existen grupos que buscan la reivindicaci n de dichas tierras en forma violenta o propietarios cuyos predios son declarados en conflicto unilateralmente por estos mismos grupos violentos

2607392 i feel horrible because of the situation i put myself in and both my teams into
2607393 but i definitely learned a lot of things most importantly when youre a division i athlete and you make a mistake a lot of people are going to hear about it and a lot of people are going to find out about it and pinpoint you as a bad person
2607394 for me it was just trying to stay as positive as i could throughout the entire situation and try to let people understand yeah im a young adult i made a bad mistake but hopefully you can still take me as a good person though i did break the law i feel horrible about it and everyone i talk to does understand that
2607395 when news hit the media students are walking around pointing their fingers at you saying look at that idiot look at what he did look at how he screwed up for both his teams
2607396 its tough to walk through that but its something i definitely matured from something that made me stronger as a person
2607397 i was never screwing up before that one night i made a terrible mistake and ill regret it for the rest of my life and i certainly learned from it and who knows maybe that mistake led to me being a much better person in the long run and saved peoples lives in the long run

2607401 i felt fine last night except for the fireworks that woke me up
2607402 they were loud i was pretty relaxed ill think ill be better tomorrow and the day after
2607403 i think we were all about like lets get this party started
2607404 i couldnt ask for a better first game so im excited
2607405 it was cool seeing the fans seeing my family the place was packed all the way up to the top
2607406 i think on the defensive end i worked hard and got in front on the press but i wasnt aggressive enough offensively i need to be more aggressive in the next game
2607407 candace is such a dominant player so versatile this is her first game and she is only going to get better
2607408 she played a great game tonight but i expect her to get even better as we get into the tournament
2607409 one of the advantages of coming off the bench is that you get a feeling for what is needed
2607410 what i saw was a need to be a little more aggressive and apply a bit more pressure on the ball when i came in i just tried to get all over the point guard i feel that our defense which forced 27 turnovers kind of opened things up for our offense
2607411 i thought candace came off the bench and did a great job and catch came off the bench and did a great job
2607412 once we got the wheels going a little bit it started to work for us
2607413 at that point in the game i just felt like it was best for me to lay it up and get two points
2607414 it was cool just being out on the court and representing your country
2607415 we waited so long to be here its a great feeling
2607416 it was great for them to come and show their support
2607417 we were trying to decide whether to go or not because of the game the next night but i was so glad i went
2607418 it was just like a rush you hear your crowd and you hear your country announced and youre walking behind your flag and it really is a remarkable feeling
2607419 ive become convinced that although jesus message was personal it was not private ive been convinced that it has everything to do with public matters in general and politics in particular including economics and aid personal empowerment and choice foreign policy and war

2607809 referees have got to get rid of tip sheets its distracting their line of thought and its distracting their performances
2607810 theyll tell you that they havent got tip sheets but believe me they have
2607811 it refereeing is a tough job but theyre making it tougher for themselves by having these stupid tip sheets
2607812 they pick a couple of little things in the game previously which they so call review and they knit pick their way through a game

2607814 mick has been really providing a lot of goals and goal assists i said to him during the week can you kick five and he gave me another three so that was handy

2607818 once he learns how to play that role he might do okay
2607819 where football is heading with players and how much we tend to criticise what they do and there were a lot of comments that were made about matthew earlier this year but he is one of the best players that i have ever seen
2607820 he brings it upon himself to do everything that you would want a leader and a captain to do
2607821 theres a couple of areas where late in games he has missed shots on goal but thats because of how he has worked to try to rally the team
2607822 theres a couple of areas where we turned the ball over that made it too easy for sydney to have an easy passage towards goal and of course they had goodes and hall up the other end who were finishing off

2607828 there certainly were a lot of things talked about and it was all very important to me as long as rutgers and the state of new jersey are committed to being the best were going to grow responsibly i think thats what weve done
2607829 could i have had it if i wanted yes but im part of something bigger than just football im part of rutgers university
2607830 i felt the commitment was there i dont want to do things that way when youre part of something there has to be trust
2607831 ive been at a few places and theres always some dissent its not just at rutgers

2607842 it is kinda silly for any political campaign to allow open signup for blogs on a campaign site it is even more foolish not to moderate everything prior to posting it

2607850 what weve seen over the last couple of years is a significant increase in the number of students who own an apple laptop or apple desktop or plan to buy one
2607851 its a big land grab as far as market share is concerned
2607852 thats what theyre telegraphing when they say margins could be down this quarter and next year they know they have this opportunity in front of them they have the momentum they have the mind share

2607855 for many consumers theres still some confusion on whether their devices can even play it or if you need a specific plan but with the publicity around devices like the iphone people are realizing what their phones are capable of and were expecting a good amount of video traffic
2607856 i didnt feel much like sleeping its nice down here
2607857 you live alone dont you doesnt get much more peaceful than that
2607858 being alone and being at peace are two different things
2607859 im sorry but im not sure which one you are
2607860 george and dont worry about it mum still gets us mixed up and shes our
2607861 came down to grab a snack for fred and me
2607862 sorry i held up your brother he was just wondering what i was still doing awake
2607863 a man your age needs loads of sleep doesnt he
2607864 peaceful when now well i suppose but you have to get ninety nine percent of the family knocked out first awful lot of trouble to go to just for a quiet moment
2607865 true you shouldve asked us wed have whipped up a little something and had them all out by ten
2607866 if youre asking what i think youre asking then its none of your business
2607867 its just you know if things were the way we think they were between you then it mustve been that much more painful when he died
2607868 i loved sirius very much his death hurt me deeply and a physical relationship between the two of us would not have made that pain any stronger or weaker
2607869 you should probably go back to bed molly wont be happy if she discovers ive kept you up
2607870 yeah we were just taking a break to refuel but we can eat later
2607871 consider it our gift to you its loads better than the gift we actually got you anyway
2607872 you might be too dignified to get sloshed in front of the others but theres no need for such silliness with us drink up now
2607873 mind if we all head to bills room since youre staying in there
2607874 eggnogs dreadful without alcohol must be all that nog or whatever
2607875 bills staying with us in our room because mum assigned his room to you so can we all head up to his room
2607876 youll be doing us a favour too it was a right pain in the arse waiting for bill to start snoring and then having to keep quiet seriously inconvenient
2607877 when i went into my office one day and all my belongings including the furniture were on the ceiling
2607878 when the charm finally wore off all my things simply flipped back over and floated gently to the floor so i thank you for that im fully aware that it couldve been a lot worse
2607879 im not sure your parents are going to appreciate you bringing that up here
2607880 what can i say im not sure he can be summed up in words you just have to experience him
2607881 he was exciting and dark and even frightening in some ways not the sort of person i thought id be associating with but somehow we fit together he was confident and unashamed and sexy
2607882 he was everything or a lot of things i wanted to be
2607883 i know youve probably never considered that your quiet former professor might have a dark exciting side well perhaps he does
2607884 sirius made it okay to be a little wild he made my furry little problem seem almost normal almost okay
2607885 when was the last time you had a cock in your mouth
2607886 or in any part of you really were not fussy where we stick them
2607887 is this what the two of you brought me up here for
2607888 no no no no no uh uh this is just no
2607889 we might be going a bit fast for him lets try something else come here
2607890 and no one can hear whats going on in here either we made sure of that
2607891 i want to state for the record that this is very very wrong
2607892 having it off with a couple of young ripe students
2607893 young student mouth on your big throbbing prick thats all youve ever wanted isnt it
2607894 its a curse and its just something i have to deal with its not sexy its not kinky its not something to be turned into a harmless fetish its far from harmless its ugly and its destructive
2607895 touch that feel it and tell me what you want
2607896 how much how much come do you have for me
2607897 fuck im going to pump so much spunk inside you its going to come out your mouth
2607898 i know youve thought about fred and me the cute young identical twin boys going at each other fucking sucking and drinking each others come i
2607899 there it is theres the darkness its coming out now isnt it
2607900 we know we knew it then and we were fifteen years old you
2607901 something about pumping me full of so much spunk it comes out of my mouth i believe
2607902 i want your hot sticky spunk professor fill me full of it
2607903 well we might tell you one day oh oh yeah
2607904 nothing im fine and breakfast is wonderful molly thank you
2607905 you look as though you keep remembering something particularly awful
2607906 he spent half the night listening to celestina warbeck remember
2607907 well we find we appreciate you more and more mum now were washing our own socks
2607908 thank you george and you know theres no need to call me professor as that is no longer my profession
2607909 i havent been in contact with anybody very much but tonks has got her own family to go to hasnt she
2607910 maybe i got the impression she was planning to spend christmas alone actually
2607911 you know the pendent on that necklace we got you opens up and you can hide things inside it
2607912 good perhaps i dont need to say it then but i will anyway what happened last night was completely inappropriate and what happened at lunch just now was arguably worse your parents your little sister and brother were sitting right there with us anyone could have seen molly almost did
2607913 i didnt hear any complaints while my finger was buried in your arse
2607914 i admit i could have stopped it from happening i could have said no last night as well and i am truly sorry for that it was wrong of me to allow any of this to happen
2607915 lengthening charm thats how i was able to reach you
2607916 wouldnt have needed a lengthening charm since i was sitting right next to you but we thought fred appearing to reach behind me would look less weird than one of us reaching behind you if anyone happened to notice
2607917 well at any rate you shouldnt have done that and i shouldnt have let you i should have known better and i hope you can accept my apology
2607918 we took your mind off your loneliness though didnt we
2607919 but yes you did take my mind off some things for a while
2607920 because im a guest in your parents home do you have any idea what molly and arthur would say if they discovered what id done with two of their children
2607921 mum practically thinks of tonks as a daughter and seems awfully keen to get you together with her
2607922 plus that spending christmas alone comment was clearly meant as some kind of passive aggressive jab at you
2607923 well now i think about it i suppose mollys hardly been subtle
2607924 but you know this isnt the same thing tonks isnt her daughter
2607925 well you can deny it all you want but the fact is youre cute as hell
2607926 you certainly have a knack for picking completely inappropriate men ill give you that
2607927 then the big idiot wouldnt even talk to us you saw him downstairs the prick wouldnt even look at us
2607928 so you were attached to him not only as a brother but also as a lover
2607929 he only came because he was scrimgeours ticket to come speak to harry
2607930 perhaps part of him wanted to see you and the others he could have said no to scrimgeour
2607931 percy refuse a request from a superior you dont know him very well do you
2607932 he was sort of a quiet solid presence in the house you know
2607933 yeah when he wasnt telling us all off for being too loud or too lazy or just generally
2607934 he was like you in some ways remus well except for the telling us off part sometimes when fred and i would sneak out of bed to well i suppose its best you not know what for
2607935 sometimes wed find percy downstairs curled up in the armchair writing in the middle of the night
2607936 said it was quieter down there cause he couldnt hear us all snoring all around him
2607937 we dont know what hed write he never showed us i suppose we couldve looked anyway
2607938 but we never did seemed like too much of an invasion i guess anyway he seemed much more tolerant of us in general during those times sometimes hed let us sit with him and wed just talk
2607939 well it sounds like you have some nice memories of him and im sure youll have more hes a reasonable man hell come to his senses
2607940 seems like no ones noticed were gone we might have some time to play a bit
2607941 i cant do this not here not with molly and arthurs children not in bills room
2607942 yes i know youre adults and i respect the fact that you can both make your own decisions and you can choose to seduce older men if you like not that i think thats what happened
2607943 but this feels very very wrong to me you can understand that cant you
2607944 well perhaps but thats not a promise or anything alright
2607945 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
2607946 we call on all the parties to immediately engage in a cease fire we urge all parties to commence the dialogue
2607947 the organisation for security and cooperation in europe osce has offered the finnish foreign minister to get the parties together to discuss what has been a longstanding difficult issue
2607948 the later statements that we hear especially from the international community are quite hopeful
2607949 what we right now need is at least a one day cease fire to get all the civilians out and then we can move on things from there
2607950 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are of course a crime and above all its a crime against their own people
2607951 thats because a mortal blow has been dealt to the territorial integrity of georgia itself
2607952 therefore huge damage has been inflicted on its statehood its hard to imagine how south ossetia can be convinced to be a part of the georgian state
2607953 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate moreover they are necessary in line with existing international agreements
2607954 russia is not only carrying out peacekeeping tasks but is also obliged if one of the sides violates a cease fire agreement to protect the other side
2607955 i have a mandate to to liberate the zone of conflict from violators
2607956 whatever it takes we will do the only way to stop it is for the commander in chief of the georgian army to withdraw from the area they illegally occupied
2607957 a tank assault has been stopped on the southern suburbs of tskhinvali 12 georgian tanks have been put out of action
2607958 we are defending against a georgian infantry attack that is continuing in the south of tskhinvali
2607959 around the time of the oscars every year i often hear people say things like
2607960 gamers can find respite from the heat and take advantage of time off to engage in their passion
2607961 i want his socks and his shorts and then ill forgive him
2607962 hes obviously in the process of learning the differences in rugby union and rugby league
2607963 bit by bit hell pick them up rugby league is perhaps more aggressive than union
2607964 when he came to centre he got a bit more ball tonight the toulon public have discovered an amazing player who is going to play for us in the top 14
2607965 the two or three balls he did get he showed great enthusiasm the supporters really appreciated that and were hoping to get a lot more from him as well
2607966 they like to be in your face and i suppose they like the rough stuff a little bit more than at home
2607967 thats the sonny special hes got to learn to wrap his arms around i guess if the rugby league boys saw it theyd probably think the rugby union boys are a bit soft but thats the rules

2607975 i wont talk about any specific cases or individuals but we wouldnt offer a scholarship if we knew they had problems with the law
2607976 texas is one of the hardest schools when it comes to looking at character
2607977 when youre looking at a guys physical attributes you can just watch him and find out if hes got what youre looking for you dont know if hes always going to develop but you know if the foundation is there
2607978 but its the character that weve got to do a lot of research on now
2607979 this is a hard deal we try to research guys the best we can we talk to coaches high school counselors principals parents teachers opposing coaches we talk to everybody and its still not an exact science
2607980 i think they almost ask more questions about character now than they do about a players athletic ability
2607981 well the ones that do more research some of these schools offer kids scholarships before they even come talk to us
2607982 they see them at a recruiting camp and they offer him there then they come and ask questions not texas or texas a amp m they ask questions first then offer
2607983 one of the main issues some schools have is all these high school coaches want players to go to big time programs
2607984 its a big deal when youre a high school coach and one of your players goes to texas or oklahoma florida or usc its more attention more press so these coaches want their players going to these big schools
2607985 i dont know if high school coaches lie to college coaches but they might not be 100 percent forthcoming about the kids background youve got to know a high school coach is being honest with you
2607986 if theyve got good values in their family and they tell you the truth they call you when theyre supposed to they show up when theyre supposed to they e mail back when you e mail them and theyve done things for the school and leadership with the community theyre responsible those are no brainers but that makes sense
2607987 we prefer kids from two parent families because they tend to be more stable
2607988 more recently weve accepted kids from one parent families because half the kids come from those homes now our rule is that there has to be one strong parent as a role model
2607989 if we have trouble with the parents we dont recruit the kid
2607990 if hes got a high test score and low grades it means he hasnt really been working as hard and isnt putting as much effort into school
2607991 a confident kid is going to have success and isnt as prone to falling into something because of peer pressure
2607992 youve got to talk to the assistant coaches coaches of their opponents the coaches of the opponent might not know as much about character but theyre good to talk to the more people you talk to the more you know the kid youre recruiting
2607993 youd like to think that youre aware of most of the stuff that happens off the field
2607994 even in a class 5a program you hear about most the stuff that happens off the field
2607995 the way i see it is if i have kept a kid on my football team hes worth any college recruiting if he wasnt worth it he wouldnt be on my team
2607996 there have been some times throughout my career i dont know if its 20 percent 15 percent or 10 percent sometimes guys who you think are good for your place somewhere along the line they do something that you know theyre not a fit for your place
2607997 you get fooled for a while but usually the kids characters reveal themselves
2607998 i smiled a bit when i saw a few posts from people who suggested i started the triiibe group as some sort of grand scheme to sell books ive gotta tell you there are far easier ways to sell a few thousand copies of a book than to build and run an online community
2607999 no people most people dont do things only for money
2608000 indirect ways a book can increase your revenue stream what authors do get from publishing a book is the opportunity to share their unique vision their specific knowledge their hard won lessons with the world to better other peoples lives they get the honor and prestige of having pushed through all the obstacles to actually write and publish a book some polls indicate that as many as 82 percent of people say they have a book in them most get no further than that others do according to susan driscoll and diane gedymin in get published some 14 million adult americans engage in some form of creative writing in a year finished manuscripts for an estimated 8 million novels and 17 million how to books are lying in desk drawers all over the country waiting to be published the dip

2608018 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2608019 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2608020 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2608021 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2608022 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2608023 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2608024 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2608025 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2608042 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2608043 these are always case by case bases its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2608044 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2608045 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up

2608051 take advantage of the natural cycles immanent in the reproductive system and engage in marital intercourse during those times that are infertile
2608052 i feel like it really works in harmony with the way that god designed our bodies to work
2608053 in contrast with the pill which works by altering and suppressing our natural systems nfp works by supporting those systems in harmony with their functions it goes with the flow so to speak there is a wisdom and a rightness to that which i really appreciate
2608054 the only spiritual objection i have to birth control is that for me using hormonal birth control indicates that i dont really trust god with every area of my life
2608055 it is an effort on my part to control something that i really believe god can be trusted with
2608056 a fascinating examination of gods sovereignty and human free will
2608057 what does it mean to submit your physical bodies to gods sovereign care
2608058 our personal experience in the past five years has shown that we had a lot to learn about nfp and that there is a dark side we werent aware of
2608059 during such times as well as during menopause and stressful life seasons strict nfp reaches a point where it is more harmful for a marriage than good

2608085 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2608086 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2608087 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2608088 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2608089 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2608090 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
2608091 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2608092 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2608093 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2608094 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2608095 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2608096 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2608097 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2608098 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2608099 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2608100 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2608101 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2608102 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2608103 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2608104 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy
2608105 the aiken family the foster family and the parker family are all thrilled
2608106 people dont want to have that type of stuff pushed people who are living in omaha or in charlotte or wherever
2608107 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2608108 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did
2608109 bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2608110 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in
2608111 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2608112 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2608113 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities
2608114 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2608115 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2608116 there was an incident involving angie everhart and her boyfriend
2608117 he was gone from the location of the incident before deputies arrived there were minor injuries but they did not require medical attention he was subsequently booked for misdemeanor spousal battery
2608118 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2608119 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish
2608120 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
2608121 why cause you scared of me scared im a say something you expletive right think i wont say something
2608122 its like somebody says something and they run like wildfire with this stuff
2608123 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2608124 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2608125 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous

2608243 we know where we need to make a step up but we also know we have the ability to do just that were now going to sit down and focus on the all blacks whom the boks face in cape town this coming weekend
2608244 we knew it was going to be tough they are the best team in the world and it was also a difficult time of the year for us to come out here and play we gave it our all in the first 30 minutes but couldnt maintain the momentum
2608245 after that i got mad and played not very concentrated the rest of the round
2608246 i couldnt come back after that eight because i was mad
2608247 i was fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the round

2608255 on his new planet earth physiology will react to the radiation of a differently colored sun causing him to develop abilities far beyond those of mortal men
2608256 he will be faster than a speeding prius stronger than the existing superfund program and able to leap mountains of red tape in a single bound these superpowers will sustain him in his never ending battle against conservatives wealthy industrialists and other environmental supervillains

2608268 there are a lot decisions that go into a publicly funded program and there are only so many health care dollars available
2608269 had we known the vaccine was available we would have made private arrangements to have brody covered
2608270 no other kid in the province should die from this devastating disease
2608271 no other parents should suffer the tragedy that my wife and i have suffered and will likely suffer the rest of our lives

2608313 ive got my foot on the rock and my mind made up though i walk through the lonely valley though i drink from the bitter cup when the devil comes a knockin showing me an easier way i stand right square on my feet i throw my head in the air i look him straight in the eye i say my foots on the rock and my minds made up
2608314 the idea of selflessness is to let go of all of the trappings of self identity which include our notions and beliefs about who we are our preferences our desires and our expectations or aspirations the practices that are described in kabbalistic literature for attaining this state are
2608315 startup ideas are so hard to come by everythings been done if i had a great idea id definitely do a startup

2608317 that sleaze ball who cheated on his wife while she was dying of cancer
2608318 the final hours before d day were employed in checking personal equipment sharpening the knives we had bought in jacksonville and san francisco and the regulation bayonets
2608319 in our cabin tonight capt hawkins who was to be the first marine ashore on guadalcanal and i talked over the coming offensive he said the men were ready all over the ship he said he had seen them sharpening their bayonets oiling their knives cleaning and sighting along their rifles and they do it without being told he said as if awed by the phenomenon
2608320 on deck the lads lounged about still shooting the breeze still sharpening knives i just want to kill a jap thats all said one of them to me
2608321 marines gathered in a small knot of sweaty dungarees and dangling web belts hung with sagging canteens knives and bayonets
2608322 i had dug an l shaped foxhole along the chicken wire fence line this was what i considered a clever new foxhole design that anyone wishing to get at me had to stick his head into the short end of the l this put his neck in a convenient position for me to grab it and rip it open with a very keen hunting knife i had bought at jacksonville before i had gotten the hunting knife i had owned a hook knife used to butcher hogs but it was stolen from me it was too novel for anyone to resist so it was not long in my possession but the hunting knife that replaced this hook knife was adequate to any job i felt and i was proud of it you cannot easily cut a throat with a bayonet it was too dull it is a stabbing weapon anyway so most of us bought from our own funds various knives for emergencies and for cooking the bayonet was a can opener and a good one
2608323 the landing ration bars a chocolate bar fortified with mysterious elements known only to the war department were hard slabs guaranteed to contain enough food value to provide energy for a day or two ordinarily it took about two days to eat one bar as they were slightly bitter and served to kill the appetite rather than satisfy it when we had canned milk we prepared a hot drink using the landing ration bars the mix was prepared by shaving the bar with a knife allowing the thin pieces to fall into an empty canteen cup this process required about fifteen minutes of careful work as the shavings had to be thin or they would not dissolve in the milk a large size can of condensed milk was then opened and poured into the canteen cup which was placed in the fire to heat occasional stirring with a bayonet turned the mixture into a rich thick cocoa unequaled for its food value and ability to kill any known appetite for almost twelve hours
2608324 corp george f grady of new york city had charged a group of eight japs on gavutu hill by himself he had killed two with his sub machine gun when the gun jammed it was probably a reising he used it as a club to kill one more jap and then dropping his gun had drawn his sheath knife he carried on his belt and stabbed two more of the enemy before he was himself killed by the three japs who remained unharmed
2608325 the first official knife adopted by the marine corps was a combat weapon designed by lt colonel clifford h shuey usmc formerly in charge of the engineer division at marine corps headquarters patterned after the british commando knife this weapon was a sturdy all steel he meant all metal stiletto 14 inches long with a short guard and a knurled steel actually zinc handle particularly adapted for use by landing parties and the raider battalions though this type of knife had proved admirable for quick raids on the french and norwegian coasts and served excellently well the purpose for which it was provided in the southwest pacific it could not be used for both of the purposes that any jungle knife must serve hand to hand combat and the daily chores of campaign life that is for hacking vines cutting saplings or whittling branches opening cans preparing food possibly even for grubbing out foxholes duties for which the bayonet was awkward and too tender a weapon and the machete too cumbrous

2608327 after a handmade sample embodying all the features desired was produced through the cooperation of one of the knife manufacturers union cutlery company ka bar brand it was offered to various officers returning from guadalcanal prior to its final adoption and was considered by them as the ideal knife for the purposes desired the marine corps commandant authorized the production of the knife on 23 november 1942 on 27 january 1943 the first shipment of 2100 knives to fill the most urgent needs was nearing its destination

2608330 far be it from us that we should forsake the lord to serve other gods
2608331 i dont know what the hell im going to do in september
2608332 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2608333 that seems like so long ago it seems like a dream
2608334 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down that i know every guy in the locker room or they know me
2608335 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2608336 i was really surprised that today i was as effective as i was and im not saying that that was good
2608337 im just saying i was able to take a snap call a play we were able to break a huddle and i was able to complete passes in some sort of rhythm
2608338 all the rumors about him throwing hard yeah theyre true
2608339 as soon as we stepped out here the stands are filled and it creates a new energy for the team
2608340 i came here as a kid and there were always a few people here and there but nothing like this
2608341 of course i and this team would come out being victorious
2608342 i hope at the end of this season i really do that i feel like i made the right decision i hope the jets fans and the people throughout the nfl world feel like i made the right decision at this point i think it was the right decision id love to win the super bowl i wouldve loved to have gone and won it last year as i said yesterday and the day before my intentions are to help this team win
2608343 hes trying to learn everybodys name trying to figure out where the cafeteria is and the dorm rooms and all that other stuff

2608346 im two weeks behind as far as practice and im also 38 years old so im a little bit behind there too
2608347 my arm feels fine itll be tired tomorrow and itll be sore because theres no substitute for getting into game type situations and putting the pads on
2608348 a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others
2608349 when the governments boot is on your throat whether it is a left boot or a right boot is of no consequence
2608350 the cynical might say that the publicity that sahayatrika has received has also been propelled by the commodification and hyper sexualization of lesbian identity the invisibility of women loving women in daily life is countered by constructions of the lesbian in the popular imagination and a proportion of our hotline callers seem to imagine a lesbian not to be a woman with same sex attractions but instead a woman who will have sex with anyone and our efforts to create safe women centered spaces are at risk of being overwhelmed by male sexual harassment desire
2608351 oops become a member but if your on a member account it will say you have been banned for hours minutes its a weird glitch
2608352 i love him when im not talking to him i cant get him out of my mind but were only friends when we talk i want him to love me but our religions would make our relationship unsuccessful i hope he doesnt love me actually i hope he does love me
2608353 there is in fact good reason to suspect that the classification of sexual paraphilias as mental disorders or illnesses is the codification of social mores the historical record clearly shows that in issues such as masturbation abortion and contraception venereal disease and the inferiority of women and blacks physicians have generally supported the prevailing mores presenting research that gave credence and medical scientific legitimacy to social prejudices
2608354 would it make people angry make some people uncomfortable im assuming it would
2608355 barack is not the next messiah whos going to fix it all in the end hes just a man
2608356 to have taken up painting no matter at what age or point in ones life is to have entered into a new and deeper awareness of the whole meaning of existence to have tasted spiritual refreshment and to have found the perfect form of creative relaxation

2608361 ah nggak usah dibahas nanti kalau matinya masuk neraka kan dia juga yang nanggung akibatnya

2608386 a capoeira praticada nas senzalas ruas e quilombos foi vista como uma amea a pelos governantes que assim estabeleceram em 1821 medidas de repress o capoeiragem incluindo castigos f sicos e pris o as medidas policiais contra a capoeira s deixaram de vigorar a partir da d cada de 1930 mas isto n o significou que fosse plenamente aceita e que seus praticantes tivessem a simpatia da sociedade brasileira
2608387 assim dois ramos da capoeira surgiram na d cada de 1940 e se distinguiram mais efetivamente a partir dos anos 70 ocorreu por um lado a organiza o da capoeira esportiva capoeira regional como arte marcial e por outro lado a mobiliza o de grupos de resist ncia cultural afro baiana que perceberam nos poucos grupos angoleiros a manuten o dos elementos da capoeira trazidos pelos africanos de origem banto
2608388 a capoeira de angola a m e de todas as outras e vem sendo cada vez mais respeitada tendo se abastecido muito do candombl com m sicas letras entre outras coisas
2608389 a diferen a entre essa capoeira e as outras o lado l dico infantil eu venho aqui com os problemas do dia a dia e saio de alto astral alegre fiquei viciada na capoeira e nesse ambiente gostoso que ela proporciona

2608396 esta a o s contribui para o agravo do nosso problema todo mundo reclama da polui o do rio mas alguns moradores daqui tamb m s o responss veis pelo estado que o rio se encontra
2608397 ap s algumas drenagens precebemos a exist ncia deste duto que impedia a continuidade de nossos trabalhos temos a inten o de resolver o problema do rio mas para isso preciso que a embasa resolva o problema do duto e tamb m das bocas de esgotos que constantemente despejam dejetos no canal e s o de sua resposabilidade
2608398 e podem ter sido as constantes escava es da sumac que tornou este emiss rio vuner vel

2608437 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2608438 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2608439 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2608440 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2608441 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2608442 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2608443 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2608444 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2608445 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2608446 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2608447 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2608448 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2608449 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2608450 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2608451 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2608452 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2608453 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2608454 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2608455 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2608456 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2608457 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2608458 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2608459 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2608460 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2608461 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2608462 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough

2608495 if we dont get any joy with the dna we might look at a reconstruction but that is way down the track
2608496 we are going to try everything else we will go down the dna path first and that will take a couple of months
2608497 if we dont get anything from the dna then we will make a decision whether or not we are going to go down the reconstruction path or whether it is going to have to be filed as a john doe
2608498 the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the renaissance
2608499 what makes this complicated is that until the whole package is done its not done
2608500 yes we have things on the table that weve agreed to
2608501 they are obviously going to be extremely attentive not just to the substance but also to the presentation
2608502 have granted us exclusive jurisdiction for u s troops and dod defense department employees the iraqis can bring forward any concerns on any cases and we may decide to let them handle it
2608503 but the positives outweighed the negatives by a mile this was a test we undoubtedly passed
2608504 a good start they embarrassed us in midfield sometimes but we were better where it mattered up front and in the centre of defence
2608505 o torcedor queria esta atitude de ra a tivemos um bom posicionamento defensivo foi um jogo ruim no primeiro tempo mas prefer vel levar assim do que se abrir e correr o risco de perder como fizemos em outros jogos a equipe estava al m do limite de ang stia e esse n o era o melhor time que temos eles torcedores entenderam viram que o jogo n o era t o bom e apoiaram isso d uma aliviada

2608511 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2608512 okay we go higher on the hill and push more harder
2608513 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2608514 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2608515 so what is this do what i say not what i do war is like your democratic reforms whats good for u s is good for russia no
2608516 around the time of the oscars every year i often hear people say things like
2608517 gamers can find respite from the heat and take advantage of time off to engage in their passion
2608518 do your work and then step back the only path to serenity
2608519 se verdade que um pol tico tamb m se mede pela dimens o dos seus advers rios h dias em que me sinto particularmente pequeno
2608520 hvor gammel er du n da hvilken klasse skal du g i n hvilken skole g r du p vet du hva du vil jobbe med da

2608522 im arguing that something just shifted that the new marketing isnt just about technology is not just an online phenomenon and isnt wacky not anymore
2608523 a great ad campaign will make a bad product fail faster it will get more people to know its bad
2608524 advertising doesnt create a product advantage it can only convey it
2608525 nobody counts the number of ads you run they just remember the impression you make
2608526 our job is to sell our clients merchandise not ourselves our job is to kill the cleverness that makes us shine instead of the product our job is to simplify to tear away the unrelated to pluck out the weeds that are smothering the product message
2608527 i wouldnt say im comfortable but i am more confident im just trying to put everything together its going to be good to have an actual show against somebody whos not used to us to see if i can actually do this or not
2608528 i just want to show i can make plays on the ball and be tough in run support
2608529 yes hes not in great shape yes hes overweight but both those things are changing his weight is coming down hes making good progress and he continues to improve
2608530 it is of the utmost importance that we have a place thats ours
2608531 its important to have a place thats dedicated only to soccer a place where we can schedule everything
2608532 we had to rent fields and that was very expensive
2608533 it took a long time to find the right place the right location
2608534 this books sounds very interesting maybe we should buy it maybe for some of our friends at christmas mmmm yes because nothing says christmas like social media marketing
2608535 weve missed a little bit on qualifying hopefully it looks like the car is pretty strong this week
2608536 said watern a centerville resident who works at wright patterson air force base
2608537 its a myth that people over 40 are washed up i feel better in my 40s than i did in my 30s
2608538 she weight trains has a chiropractor does yoga has a dietician and has the natural talent so its not too surprising
2608539 its a genetic component that lets her be able to maintain the physique that 99 9 percent of people dont have
2608540 as you age you lose muscle mass but if they have maintained their training they can slow that loss
2608541 in college i couldnt tell you where the rec center was now its a big thing for colleges to build bigger and better rec centers its whats important now
2608542 i think well see more older elite athletes but i wouldnt expect to see a 40 year old gymnast anytime soon
2608543 a lot of people are saying im tired because i pitched in winter ball but i only pitched eight innings in winter ball so how can i get tired with eight innings
2608544 i pitched more innings in spring training than winter ball
2608545 probably the most difficult part of this sport is coming to the park every day knowing you are in last place and have to work your way up every day thats the challenge we have what we have to overcome
2608546 i spent the first third of the season just taking it all in what a big league season is all about
2608547 im at the tail end of the second third of the season and im trying to establish myself as a player
2608548 now i feel like i have to stay upbeat and concentrate my efforts on helping the team not that i wasnt before but whatever i can do to help the team win in any way shape or form being a younger player im trying to learn that
2608549 this is his first year and he is 7 11
2608550 i started my career 1 11 0 6 my first year and started 1 5 my second year
2608551 i had a lot of old guys next to me like vicente padilla and francisco cordero in texas
2608552 they kept telling me you know you can pitch in the big leagues just keep working thats what i kept in my mind even when i was 1 11 keep confident i knew i could sometime have a year like this year
2608553 its just that they got ahead further than what we could get ahead
2608554 fort wayne beat up on us a few times but im really worried about our bullpen when you have back to back games when your starter cant go more than two innings it kills you
2608555 competing in the olympic games has always been one of my dreams and i wish i would have been able to represent my country alongside my teammates
2608556 it didnt go so well thats a tough language to learn ask anybody man thats tough im gonna worry about learning english all the way before i get to mandarin
2608557 i got ni hao and xie xie hello and thank you down pat
2608558 this will probably be one of the most watched games theres ever been in sports history
2608559 the games gonna be electrifying itll be the biggest stage ive ever been on in my career it will be loud and im sure itll send a lot of chills through my body
2608560 its my fourth trip to china and i know the way people here express their feelings about basketball its just like in america they love it and love to play it and most of all they love yao hes like their savior hes the heart of sports here
2608561 were clearly not at the level of the americans but we wont shy away from a chance of playing the best players in the world in front of all our fans its something ive dreamed about for a long long time
2608562 i dont think we understood what it meant to be an olympian and to put on a usa uniform we didnt realize all the people we were representing growing up i never thought about being an olympian all i thought about was playing in the nba
2608563 but in the last couple of years ive come to understand what this is about
2608564 and i know now this is 20 times bigger than an nba championship the whole world is watching here
2608565 the thing is we have a lot of winners on this team i dont have an nba championship or a gold medal but i won three of four state championships in my high school career and we went on to win 109 games and lose just six
2608566 i know what it takes to win and i think i know how to do it the right way on this team i think we all do now we understand what it takes to be an olympian
2608567 watch us on sunday well show you what it takes
2608568 i didnt think id never make it but some newspaper writers and all gave up on me i was never going to give up i was going to hit the ball well it was a long journey
2608569 ive learned from my mistakes stuff happens a lot of teams didnt want to bring a guy back from being suspended
2608570 now is the best time of my life other than when my son was born
2608571 im excited to be here im here to hit off lefties and start as a dh every once in a while when a lefty starts i want to help the team win and hustle and be ready off the bench
2608572 many swimmers improve after high school and college because of a more mature body better discipline and increased desire
2608573 what dara has done doesnt come as a surprise to me
2608574 the understanding of the physiology of the swimming stroke and the body in the water has increased and improved training methods have followed
2608575 thats why you see the times drop swimmers are using their whole body now their torsos not just arms and legs
2608576 before my injury a year and a half ago i could sprint with most young guys
2608577 i have a friend whos 55 and still out sprinting the young riders
2608578 i was swimming my 50 meter breaststroke in 35 seconds for years
2608579 now its at 40 seconds no matter what i do you just naturally lose bone and muscle mass
2608580 at a race in santa rosa california i got into a breakaway and wasnt hydrating
2608581 within the last few miles dehydration hit me the pack caught up and i ended up finishing 36th
2608582 the sense of thirst doesnt really hit you when you get older when i finally realized i wasnt hydrating it was too late
2608583 when you finish after all your hard work theres a feeling of satisfaction i love just knowing ive done well
2608584 cum ce sa facem mergem la rock la mures fara discutie

2608594 if im right there with him then thats pressure its going to be tough but im going to give him a run for his money
2608595 i didnt think that id be the first to get it not until the finals all i know is i wanted to be in the middle of the pool tomorrow
2608596 i just wanted to show that the entire olympic team is out to compete were going to come out with undying canadian pride and compete
2608597 all that means is that i am going to show up perform well and lead the best way i know how
2608598 that was a good first swim and i can build on that
2608599 i got the bugs out with that swim im very happy i was just lets get this party started its a lot of fun out there
2608600 obviously having the heats at night shakes things up a bit
2608601 it is always great to get the first race over and done with a few things went wrong out there but its great to know how i have some things to improve in the semi final
2608602 im going to have a double shot espresso tomorrow morning and ill be ready
2608603 while its a little nerve racking being the youngest im not really nervous before my race tomorrow im sure i will really be on edge
2608604 i got a chance to get rid of the anxious nerves get a feel for the routine and crowd and prepare for tomorrow morning
2608605 its not about the money its about what you can do with the money
2608606 o lady of last assurance light in the laurels sunrise of the dead wind of the ships and lightning of lepanto in honour of thee to whom all honor is fled
2608607 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
2608608 because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honour him with long life will i satisfy
2608609 knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing
2608610 sigh tomorrow we will be back where we truly belong
2608611 when i look at your beautiful piece it reminds me of looking down on a valley from a height and it reminds me of many aspects of our life that seem to be vanishing the lush green river flats rivers meandering through a valley full of water and life and the centre piece made me think of a beautiful oasis a haven rich in promise
2608612 how does one keep the love aflame and the spark going
2608613 i am ashamed of myself and i want to apologize to you
2608614 i have been able for these past two years to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your masters house because of my flaws you have to do all of this work and you dont get full value from your efforts
2608615 as we return to the masters house i want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path
2608616 did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path but not on the other pots side thats because i have always known about your flaw and i took advantage of it i planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while we walk back from the stream youve watered them for two years i have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my masters table without you being just the way you are he would not have this beauty to grace his house
2608617 i never feel that i have comprehended an emotion or fully lived even the smallest events until i have reflected upon it in my journal my pen is my truest confidant holding in check the passions and disappointments that i dare not share even with my beloved
2608618 and you still go every morning even though she doesnt know who you are
2608619 she doesnt know me but i still know who she is
2608620 that is the kind of love i want in my life
2608621 na primeira partida contra a china eles jogaram com dez e mesmo assim causaram muitos problemas
2608622 eles trabalham bem o jogo a reo mas tamb m n o deixam a desejar com a bola nos p s
2608623 nas partidas do brasil os jogadores ficam ansiosos em pedir a nossa camisa a de cinco estrelas para levar para os seus pa ses d para ver como ficam felizes como se tivessem ganho um trof u
2608624 love is patient and kind love does not envy or boast it is not arrogant or rude it does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth love bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things so now faith hope and love abide these three but the greatest of these is love
2608625 spent a number of years lobbying on behalf of georgia and has publicly taken strong pro georgia anti russia positions
2608626 has developed a very close relationship with president of georgia mikheil saakashvili and many senior georgian officials
2608627 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
2608628 the us should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2608629 has involved russia with opening fire at russian citizens and peacekeepers now he is trying to involve other states and international organizations
2608630 the 1980 carter doctrine that the us was determined to dominate the persian gulf is at the root of the first gulf war of the present iraq war and of the possible war on iran brzezinskis grandiose schemes of world transformation caused a renewal of the cold war and gave birth to al qaeda and without soviet restraint the results could easily have been far more tragic than they turned out to be
2608631 this project means that americans will be committed to fight and die for a gangster regime in the caucasus at the far end of the black sea
2608632 a child can always teach an adult 3 things to be happy for no reason to always be busy with something and to know to demand with all his might that which he desires
2608633 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2608634 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2608635 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2608636 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2608637 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2608638 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2608639 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2608640 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2608641 china has the games doesnt it expect the players to show up too
2608642 which categories of foreigners are not permitted to enter china
2608643 those who are believed to potentially engage in smuggling narcotic trafficking or prostitution after entering china
2608644 those who are suffering from a mental disorder or insanity sexually transmitted disease or an infectious disease such as active tuberculosis

2608647 other than that response that doesnt have a response to it its an important one so im actually glad that you said it
2608648 i confess the really messy importance of the responsibility that the city council had for this budget
2608649 what we have in front of us and what we have presented in addition to the things that people want and nobody has told me what else concretely because i agree that we want to get rid of corruption but that means you have to create ways to do it
2608650 the city has a rule that were not eliminating vacancies in the police fire and office of emergency communications even though some think those could be rearranged and organized
2608651 were not in a position to start cutting those because there is a very strong point of view that people want to have the best public safety possible
2608652 it is a popular feeling that property taxes are onerous for a good reason
2608653 but the other fees in many ways are more expensive if you were to prorate them out on a monthly basis but theyre more hidden and people dont feel as strongly about them
2608654 i dont know where theyre going but theres now going to be a 100 fine instead of a 90 fine
2608655 i would strongly recommend to everybody in this room because part of the reason the city is doing this actually is to create safer streets and if we create safer streets well save money so i feel fine telling you dont get the fine just dont go through a yellow light
2608656 we can at least leverage tif dollars for federal monies that the cta can no longer leverage because the state has been requiring that it pay off that money every year and unless the debt is restructured its not going to change
2608657 the last thing i was told which was very recently was that ground will be broken by the end of this year
2608658 contrary to rumor there has been no change everything i said i said a zillion times and im not going to say it a zillion times again
2608659 im hesitant to give any more details because as you know they obviously changed a lot over the years
2608660 the details of the project havent changed but the timing is a little elusive as you know but there is constant progress
2608661 we have a sincere desire to learn from your comments and feedback
2608662 an anthropologist at tulane has just come back from a field trip to new guinea with reports of a tribe so primitive that they have tide but not new tide with lemon fresh borax
2608663 i swear i raised that tiger like a member of the family that it tried to drag me to a mountain hideaway and eat me is pretty shocking i just didnt think frank had that in him
2608664 maybe i dont understand the process fully but this doesnt sound like good news to me he can still be traded but count on seattle having to eat some of his salary if washburn is still here in september i will definitely join all of you in criticizing pelekoudas performance

2608667 in a secular world history takes on the role of showing us good and evil virtues and vices religion no longer plays as important a role as it once did in setting moral standards and transmitting values history with a captial h is being called in to fill the void it restores a sense not necessarily of a divine being but of something above and beyond human beings it is our authority it can vindicate us and judge us and damn those who oppose us

2608669 he works for a small town lake view only employs four people the chief and three others and so they dont make a killing down there
2608670 hes doing fair he working hes struggling but he is working hes got good spirits
2608671 he aint letting it get him down hes fighting it
2608672 but i dont want to see him run out of money and dont have the things he needs
2608673 hes a good guy the reason im doing it is because weve been good friends since 2002 im just trying to help him out
2608674 you hear about cancer every day but when it starts affecting your good friends and your family its kind of rough
2608675 its a way that the people can get together and enjoy themselves on a good ride and at the same time raise money for a good cause
2608676 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2608677 these are always case by case bases its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2608678 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2608679 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2608680 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign i think it is always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results on to federal results or vice versa
2608681 for many of the people on that plane that may well have been the last thing they saw
2608682 when i think of skyline drive i think of those drag lines
2608683 you wish you didnt have to do it but this was a celebration of the process
2608684 i wish each and every iranian could travel abroad come to the u s or go to europe for just one week and feel smell and breathe freedom human dignity and realize the value of their lives
2608685 all who affirm the use of violence admit it is only a means to achieve justice and peace but peace and justice are nonviolence the final end of history those who abandon nonviolence have no sense of history rather they are bypassing history freezing history betraying history
2608686 fight in the cause of god against those who fight you but do not transgress limits god does not love transgressors
2608687 if they seek peace then seek you peace and trust in god for he is the one that heareth and knoweth all things
2608688 the most perfect in faith amongst believers is he who is best in manner and kindest to his wife
2608689 there is no compulsion or coercion in the religion islam the right direction is distinctly clear from error
2608690 of any organized attempt to force the acceptance of islam on the non muslim population or of any systematic persecution intended to stamp out the christian religion we hear nothing had the caliphs chosen to adopt either course of action they might have swept away christianity as easily as ferdinand and isabella drove islam out of spain or louis xiv made protestanism
2608691 god has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of all nations o mary god gives you good news of a word from him whose name shall be the messiah jesus son of mary honored in this world and the hereafter and one of those brought near to god he shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity and shall be of the righteous
2608692 o my lord how shall i have a son when no man has touched me
2608693 truly the likeness of jesus with god is as the likeness of adam he created him of dust and then said to him be and he was
2608694 i have come to you with a sign from your lord i make for you out of clay as it were the figure of a bird and breath into it and it becomes a bird by gods leave and i heal the blind and the lepers and i raise the dead by gods leave

2608697 a chilling term for muslims calling to mind the violent clashes between the forces of medieval christendom and islam almost 1 000 years ago
2608698 in my culture not to be a virgin is to be dirt
2608699 if youre a muslim woman growing up in more open societies in europe you can easily end up having sex before marriage
2608700 so if youre looking to marry a muslim and dont want to have problems youll try to recapture your virginity
2608701 there are many trouble spots around the world but as a general rule its easy to make an educated guess at one of the participants muslims vs jews in palestine muslims vs hindus in kashmir muslims vs christians in africa muslims vs buddhists in thailand muslims vs russians in the caucasus muslims vs backpacking tourists in bali
2608702 working is my hobby if im not traveling then id rather be at work
2608703 the training support and opportunities here are amazing we invest in talented people and im happy to work with such outstanding individuals
2608704 in no way is islamic shariah islamic government compatible with western understandings of human rights and freedom of conscience traditional islam forbids conversion from islam forbids anyone to leave islam theres no way out and it forbids muslims and non muslims to live as equals in society it mandates the second class status of non muslims forbidding them to hold authority over muslims forbidding them to hold certain jobs as a result it even mandated in history that houses of worship of jews and christians were neither to be built or repaired making communities relegated to a perpetual state of decline

2608707 i had a terrible headache i dont know where it came from probably the pollution
2608708 it feels like youre at 3 000 metres because of the air you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog

2608710 its hard to adapt but you cant cry and look for excuses
2608711 its within the power of our officiating team to take measures in case the situation is reaching an unacceptable level
2608712 what makes this complicated is that until the whole package is done its not done
2608713 yes we have things on the table that weve agreed to
2608714 they are obviously going to be extremely attentive not just to the substance but also to the presentation
2608715 have granted us exclusive jurisdiction for u s troops and dod defense department employees the iraqis can bring forward any concerns on any cases and we may decide to let them handle it

2608733 hey craig i um i mean cross sorry my dogs name is craig sorry i have no idea why i did that call you craig i mean cause i know your name its not that i dont know your name or anything because i do i mean youre in some of my classes and weve spoken before yknow
2608734 i just got a job working here i need some extra cash so here i am
2608735 the pleasure was all mine its not every day you get to play knight in shining armor to such a beautiful maiden in distress
2608736 its the world we live in give and take sweet and sour its the sweet part that makes getting up in the morning a little easier
2608737 thanks i never thought id be one of the few people the royalty of colonial high would smile on
2608738 do you really think cross and i are as cold and distant as everyone else thinks
2608739 i think that you guys are popular and i am but a painfully awkward and unpopular little girl here to revere and adore you at every spare moment or whatever dont listen to me it is quite possible im on crack and just dont know it yet i have absolutely no idea what the hell just came out of my mouth ignore me while i climb in a locker and die
2608740 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
2608741 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
2608742 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
2608743 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
2608744 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
2608745 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
2608746 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
2608747 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
2608748 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
2608749 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
2608750 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
2608751 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
2608752 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
2608753 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
2608754 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
2608755 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
2608756 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
2608757 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
2608758 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
2608759 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
2608760 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
2608761 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
2608762 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
2608763 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
2608764 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
2608765 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
2608766 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
2608767 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
2608768 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
2608769 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
2608770 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
2608771 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
2608772 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
2608773 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
2608774 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
2608775 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
2608776 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
2608777 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
2608778 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
2608779 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
2608780 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
2608781 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
2608782 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
2608783 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
2608784 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
2608785 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
2608786 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
2608787 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
2608788 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures

2608790 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2608791 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2608792 the emperor must have known that surah 2 256 reads
2608793 show me just what muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
2608794 to invite all to the way of the lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious
2608795 let him who will believe and let him who will reject it
2608796 those who receive guidance do so for the good of their own souls those who stray do so to their own loss
2608797 if people accept guidance they do it for the good of their own souls and if any stray the messenger is only a warner
2608798 if any will see it will be for the good of his own soul if any will be blind it will be to his own harm the messenger is not here to watch over their doings
2608799 allah is our lord and your lord for us is the responsibility for our deeds and for you for your deeds there is no contention between us and you
2608800 if people argue with him dispute with him charge him with falsehood he is to say my work to me and yours to you
2608801 to turn away from them have patience with what they say and leave them with noble dignity
2608802 if it were allahs will he could gather people together unto true guidance
2608803 if it had been allahs plan they would not have taken false gods but the lord did not send the messenger to watch over their doings nor is he set over them to dispose of their affairs
2608804 if allah had so willed he would have made mankind a single people but his plan is to test them in what he hath given them so they must strive as in a race in all virtues
2608805 if it had been the lords will they would all have believed all who are on earth wilt thou then compel mankind against their will to believe
2608806 let there be no compulsion in religion truth stands out clear from error
2608807 the early period when muhammad was still powerless and under threat
2608808 it is not for the messenger but for the lord to make the decision whether to turn in mercy to the unbelievers or to punish them it will be for the lord to call them to account
2608809 leave them alone until they encounter that day of theirs wherein they shall perforce swoon with terror
2608810 those who believe then reject faith then believe again and again reject faith and go on increasing in unbelief allah will not forgive them nor guide them on the way
2608811 anyone who after accepting faith in allah utters unbelief except under compulsion his heart remaining firm in faith but such as open their breast to unbelief on them is wrath from allah and theirs will be a dreadful penalty
2608812 to those against whom war is made permission is given to fight because they are wronged and verily allah is most powerful for their aid they are those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right for no cause except that they say
2608813 cam san everyone is talking about it these days how it is changing the face of the earth but there is one thing that will never change and that is the human heart
2608814 in my past 3 years of experiance in this field i have realised that
2608815 omg we should totally go out for dinner or something
2608816 if i dont sit down theyre going to have me arrested for nothing more than raising my voice in response to their stupidity
2608817 the last person on earth id like to speak to would be anyone who is employed by united airlines
2608818 this government and its citizens cannot have it both ways
2608819 either we are part of this society deserving the same tax breaks as heterosexual couples and our participation in the military is as respected or we are not if not then we must separate from this union and take our tax base with us
2608820 our brothers and sisters at stonewall stood up united and stopped the constant harassment by police officers
2608821 we need to learn from that example and honor their heroic stand by taking our life condition to the next level freedom from being a political election bargaining chip
2608822 since we are not treated as equal members of this society we have every right to form our own union and take our tax base with us we can decide which foreign and domestic policies to support many scientists out there could use our dollars to search for an aids cure for example what do you say are we adult enough or do we need religiously controlled government permission
2608823 i guarantee it nobody in the league has worked any harder than john beck
2608824 you can make a mistake and get caught in a submission but chuck made a mistake and he got caught in an ass whoopin
2608825 a 1950s model of the family with mum at home baking biscuits and looking after the children bears little relation to the realities of modern times
2608826 because we believe that it is a fairer and more consistent way to tax income splitting gives appropriate recognition to the interdependence of the family unit rather than employing an unduly individualistic conception of family members
2608827 a 1950s model of the family with mum at home baking biscuits and looking after the children bears little relation to the realities of modern times
2608828 sure come on over and stay at my place for the next few weeks to a month and a half itll be fun
2608829 a lot of the people in high level government positions remember swimming in this pool when they were children
2608830 there is a lot of pride associated with it in the community
2608831 we did our best to finish it in one month and it is a great job
2608832 there were a lot of people in the beginning who had doubts about the restoration of this historic landmark
2608833 so the son wanted to do a very good job for his father and make sure it was absolutely perfect
2608834 this is a great indication of security the beginnings of liberty and all of those good things that are needed in order for a true society to begin again
2608835 im filing a 10 million libel action and i dont think you want ap to be part of that
2608836 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned

2608839 baghdad he works as a blacksmith in one of baghdads swarming shiite slums but at least once a month abu saif tucks a pistol into his belt hops into a minibus taxi and speeds south his goal to unearth ancient treasures from thousands of archaeological sites scattered across southern iraq
2608840 saad eskander the director of iraq s national library and archive in baghdad finally had some time to catch up on his diary after a couple of very busy weeks
2608841 the pieces were seized at al tanaf crossing on the syrian iraqi border they were hidden in a bag in an iraqi crossing into syria the artifacts include different sized glassware and clay tools
2608842 this is the third smuggling attempt aborted in less than two months by syrian customs officials last month the syrian cultural ministry handed iraq back some 700 pieces of looted priceless antiquities seized inside syria
2608843 the head archaeologist mohammed yahya said the town is more than 20 000 square meters in area and includes administrative quarters temples and other buildings of magnificent and splendid design yahya who is the head of the provincial antiquities department in the province of diwaniya where the new babylonian town was discovered said he still lacks evidence on the town s ancient name the locals call it shamiya after a provincial district nearby he said
2608844 that his team has come across several cuneiform tablets but there is no one to read the ancient writing because iraqi experts with the knowledge to decipher mesopotamian script have fled the country

2608848 the sunday times of april 13 it is a must read mentioning a potential british army effort to protect archaeological sites in the south he ends thus
2608849 by now summer of 2008 excess deaths from violence in iraq since march of 2003 must be at least a million this conclusion can be reached more than one way there is not much controversy about it in the scientific community some 310 000 of those were probably killed by us troops or by the us air force with the bulk dying in bombing raids by us fighter jets and helicopter gunships on densely populated city and town quarters in absolute numbers that would be like bombing to death everyone in pittsburgh pa or cincinnati oh only the us is 11 times more populous than iraq so 310 000 iraqi corpses would equal 3 4 million dead americans so proportionally it would be like firebombing to death everyone in chicago
2608850 the wars of iraq the iran iraq war the repressions of the kurds and the shiites the gulf war and the american calamity may have left behind as many as 3 million widows having lost their familys breadwinner many are destitute
2608851 but over 500 a month dead in political violence is appalling enough the srebenica massacre in 1995 killed 8 000 at the average rate of death in iraq this winter and spring a similar massacre will have been racked up in 2008 in the northern ireland troubles over 30 years about 3 000 people died and it was widely considered a bad situation that death toll is still being achieved every 6 months in iraq according to the official may statistics and of course by the rule of 11 that death toll would be like nearly 6 000 americans dying in political violence every month or 72 000 a year note that this 72 000 figure would only be political deaths since it does not include criminal homicides the annual total murder rate in the us is about 16 000 including political violence what little there is the us is one of the most violent societies on earth and iraq in may makes it look like a pacifist convention
2608852 at the end of 1943 as war raged in europe general dwight d eisenhower wrote to his commanders in italy clearly expressing his intent to spare cultural property from damage whenever possible today we are fighting in a country which has contributed a great deal to our cultural inheritance a country rich in monuments which by their creation helped and now in their old age illustrate the growth of the civilization which is ours we are bound to respect those monuments so far as war allows this statement and other protective measures for cultural property were a direct result of concerted efforts by governments the military and cultural heritage professionals of many of the allied nations to protect europes cultural heritage during world war ii
2608853 the coalition forces in iraq did not have the kind of m onuments f ine a rts and a rchives units that were present during world war ii while most countries still have civil affairs units few cultural heritage personnel serve in todays military leaving most military commanders without this expert advice furthermore units receive little training on cultural property protection beyond instructions to avoid damage during military operations some european nations maintain civil military cooperation units including a small force of reservists who are cultural heritage professionals however their deployment is often hindered by their nations rules regarding entry into combat areas

2608865 with the opening of the beijing olympic games the world has entered an olympic period during these special days the outbreak of armed clashes in south ossetia is something the worlds people do not wish to see
2608866 we believe the olympic games are not the place for demonstrations and we hope that all people attending the games recognize the importance of this
2608867 it is always sad to see such a ceremony disrupted
2608868 the f b i is committed to protecting the news media consistent with the first amendment and department of justice policies and we very much regret that this situation occurred
2608869 my mom went out and bought a ping pong table
2608870 dont feed your infant any gerber food for the rest of this year
2608871 so far this year 150 apparent flying saucers have been reported to police military bases and the ministry of defence compared to just 135 for the whole of 2007 and 97 the year before
2608872 where they regularly airbrushed out images of ufos from the high resolution satellite imaging
2608873 one of these people was a nasa photographic expert and she said that in building 8 of johnson space center they regularly airbrushed out images of ufos from the high res satellite imaging
2608874 i was using something a bit like pc anywhere called remotely anywhere so i could actually see the desktop of the machine i had control of it was at nasa i was spotted i even saw the chaps or womans mouse cursor come down right click the local area connection icon and choose disconnect
2608875 because i was using a java application i could only get a screenshot of the picture it did not go into my temporary internet files at my crowning moment someone at nasa discovered what i was doing and i was disconnected
2608876 contained names and ranks of u s air force personnel who are not registered anywhere else it also contained information about ship to ship transfers but ive never seen the names of these ships noted anywhere else
2608877 i would imagine that the government is going to try to show that hes not this eccentric but that he is using that as his cover story where his real motivation is attacking the government and the military because of u s policies
2608878 us foreign policy is akin to government sponsored terrorism these days it was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on september 11 last year i am solo
2608879 nearly seven years after the 9 11 attacks spawned the question why do they hate us and made the repair of americas poor international image a top foreign policy pursuit the bush administration is taking a new tack in the war of ideas out or at least de emphasized is the effort to explain america and its widely disdained foreign policy in on the other hand is a focus on defeating terrorism and in particular radical islam by largely leaving america out of the equation the plan instead is to promote alternatives to radical violent extremism and nurture the local forces deemed best suited to countering it
2608880 the effort to explain america and its widely disdained foreign policy
2608881 no one would believe this so we have to lie
2608882 and this is my kind of love its the kind that moves on
2608883 drag me far enough to know im blind every mile that you burn
2608884 im gonna learn ya my philosophy you wanna know about atrocity
2608885 and this is my kind of love its the kind that moves on
2608886 and would turn out to be andrew woods most well known song ever theres a good reason it rules
2608887 drag me far enough to know im blind every mile that you burn
2608888 which made it big after being featured in the movie
2608889 im gonna learn ya my philosophy you wanna know about atrocity
2608890 i dont drive on your bike routes so dont ride on my streets
2608891 skilled bicyclists have demonstrated the efficacy and the safety of bicycle driving on major roadways and expressways without causing deaths or injuries
2608892 we rely too much on the wheelmen and not enough on casual bicyclists
2608893 do you remember learning how to drive and how frightening it was new cyclists have the same fear much of it stemming from the unknown that fear is the biggest element preventing people from riding on the street
2608894 it doesnt matter where you ride within the lane someone is going to send you a message get off my street
2608895 things are challenging for both motorists and cyclists but in a general way when i ride my bike as a vehicle i get treated pretty much like a vehicle
2608896 is that from the curb to the lane line if so the lane is narrower as the gutter area is unusable due to debris and storm drains
2608897 bicyclists are full taxpaying citizens like anyone else though were a little slow motorists successfully pass slow or stopped vehicles all the time
2608898 so as far right as practicable makes sense to me but im going to control that lane we have 3 asphalt overlays storm grates so to me as far right as practicable means about 5 feet from the curb
2608899 am i missing something or are these guys selling one dollar bills for 80 cents how is that a sustainable business
2608900 know anything about this company red hat they went public with a 3 billion market cap and near as i can tell their software is free am i missing something how is that a sustainable business or should i short microsoft stock
2608901 jumping into the pool a legal guide to engineering you open source code release
2608902 there is no such thing as an open source business model
2608903 what open source can learn from microsoft and the proprietary world
2608904 is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention
2608905 to the curious incident of the dog in the night time
2608906 the new york times has not deigned to touch the story although it recently ran thousands of words on a relationship between mccain and a female lobbyist which appeared to be based more on innuendo than fact
2608907 i understand it to some point if i put myself into a favre fanatics shoes
2608908 the things i cant understand the things i really take personally is when im driving up to the parking lot gate and punching in my punch code and somebody says f u to me that kind of bothers me or when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me the boos they expect a high level of play and they miss brett favre i understand that but the f u and the little kids saying swear words to me i dont understand that
2608909 basically the first cell of al qaeda in the united states what was the suspicious behavior some prayed loudly in the gate area spoke angrily about the u s and saddam switched seats and unnecessarily requested seat belt extenders with heavy buckles that could be used as weapons according to witnesses americas first muslim congressman keith ellison d mn who took his oath to office on the koran said the imams situation reflects a misunderstanding of muslim prayer and will be sorted out in court the airport is in ellisons district while some constituents have understood the fears of the passenger who reported the clerics prayers as suspicious activity many more have expressed shock and surprise at what they perceive as discrimination
2608910 i think people are afraid there will be a chapter two
2608911 go ahead write the script on spec well give you notes and get it into shape
2608912 hey can you show my movie and give me a cut of the door
2608913 i just got an hd camera do you want to shoot something
2608914 heres this credit cared with 1 000 on it heres another one with 2 000 left lets go
2608915 he wants to play for the yankees so he can get at the red sox
2608916 but i have heard him say that if he served jesus though not knowing the name specific
2608917 could he reach thousands of false converts under one roof
2608918 and the miraculous preaching of the law and the gospel will be in the hearing of guys like rod parsley and jesse duplantis
2608919 may we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting 20you are bringing some strange ideas to our ears and we want to know what they mean
2608920 21 all the athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas
2608921 men of athens i see that in every way you are very
2608922 thumpin it the use and abuse of the bible in todays presidential politics
2608923 if he can get up for 21 to 30 percent hes gold
2608924 and thats exactly what hes doing hes going to fissure off this progressive evangelical voter
2608925 i dont know why im surprised i really shouldnt be after all john edwards is just another in a long line of politicians to cheat on his wife now a days it seems that political affairs are just part of the washington dc landscape all that being said i am still shocked honestly i dont know what surprises me more a that john edwards the seemingly genuine and honest son of a mill worker betrayed his wife and family b that the national enquirer actually broke a real story
2608926 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2608927 these are always case by case bases its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2608928 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2608929 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2608930 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign i think it is always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results on to federal results or vice versa
2608931 to see this many people its 7 months of planning comes down to this and its just a tremendous tribute to my son and what he accomplished in his life
2608932 and to my other son it means a lot to him to be part of this and see the community come together and pay respect to the men and women in uniform
2608933 i love my husband hes a former marine its just one big family its a big family
2608934 its great its nice to see that little town of green bay other than brett favre coming out people coming out to support a good cause it helps helps bring awareness
2608935 this is a marine from the the state of wisconsin who lost his life sacrificed his life for his brothers and to have the nation honor him in this way is a tremendous tribute to him
2608936 younger evangelicals are embarrassed by the hard line against homosexuality that has come to dominate the public stance of the evangelical right
2608937 they do not believe that homosexuality is a or the major social problem and do not believe that the major family values issue is homosexuality
2608938 weve got so many national and international problems to deal with that i cant imagine that what gay people do is going to be a big issue in the future the focus is supposed to be on ourselves and our own behavior and shortcomings not on others no one is so perfect that they can afford to judge others if you dont believe that youre missing the focus of christianity and most other religions too
2608939 the latest twist in the ongoing battle for attitudes and feelings is the attempt by homosexual supporters to change the church make the once wrong now right this effort by the gblt community is the most aggressive to date in its ongoing effort for acceptance of its sexual behavior
2608940 i am an evangelical and am most certainly gay and i am not alone thank god i have wrestled with all the proscriptions in scripture for more than three decades and have decided that my sexual orientation is simply part of the diversity of man and woman kind all of which is made in the image of the creator i long for the day when my partner and i will be fully welcome in an evangelical church
2608941 i had tears in my eyes because it was so neat to see these kids come out and march around the field
2608942 and they were so proud words cant express how proud they feel
2608943 its a great feeling that hes able to enjoy this and do something he likes to do
2608944 he sees it on tv or we go to the brewers game once in a while so he sees that so it makes him feel like hes in the game
2608945 he wakes up looks forward to it just the ability to put on a ball uniform like the other kids do
2608946 takes a lot of time and a lot of money to do something like this and the fact that other people are willing to do that for others is a really cool deal
2608947 youll not make my fathers house a house of harlots
2608948 and the lord added to their number daily those who were being saved
2608949 then why do many churches have flat screen t vs
2608950 while answering a question about his christian faith obama said he believes that jesus christ died for his sins and through gods grace and mercy he could have
2608951 s he was the kindest most decent generous person that i have ever known
2608952 im sure she is in heaven even though she may not have subscribed to everything that i subscribe to
2608953 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2608954 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2608955 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2608956 the only way that we can have compassion and that we can show compassion is to have the heart of jesus which is produced in us when we are born again through repentance towards god and faith in christ alone
2608957 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2608958 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2608959 with tony at the helm i have high hopes of really being able to influence the smurfs with my sorcerors ways
2608960 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2608961 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2608962 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2608963 i dont see any reason to be gracious to ideas it is an unfortunate fact that men who espouse bad ideas must take responsibility for the consequences
2608964 youve not answered many of my questions in this thread the chief question being how can a follower of jesus who claims to have the spirit of god dwelling within him mock the birth of the spirit
2608965 i suspect that youve been carrying water as the say for tony throughout this conversation i suspect that pb is in a position to know something about a connection between you and tony that i am not aware of
2608966 id like to ask you if turning a brother over to satan is incongruous with your assertion that were supposed to be nice and sweet to a brother in error you may with wish to read 1cor 5 where paul talks about purging out leaven paul says that a believer who is in gross sin ought to be delivered over to satan for destruction of the flesh
2608967 do you think mocking and sarcasm lie somewhere between meekness and delivering one to satan
2608968 any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2608969 our zookeepers are looking through a list of african names and were probably going to have a contest
2608970 you diligently study the scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life these are the scriptures that testify about me yet you refuse to come to me to have life
2608971 so the son of man must be lifted up that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life
2608972 this is how you can recognize the spirit of god every spirit that acknowledges that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god 3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge jesus is not from god this is the spirit of the antichrist which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world
2608973 moreover the father judges no one but has entrusted all judgment to the son
2608974 for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him
2608975 those who have done good will rise to live and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned
2608976 you judge by human standards i pass judgment on no one
2608977 as for the person who hears my words but does not keep them i do not judge him for i did not come to judge the world but to save it there is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words that very word which i spoke will condemn him at the last day
2608978 the mind of sinful man is death but the mind controlled by the spirit is life and peace
2608979 he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself
2608980 behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world
2608981 for if when we were gods enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his son how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life
2608982 trying to get the protester out was quite noisy it sounded like they were in a bit of trouble but youve got to forget about that and carry on i dont think it affected him
2608983 with the stage his horse is at it was more than what could be expected
2608984 the man is a real machine hes been working nutting it out and getting everything into detail he didnt thrown away any marks at all in there
2608985 ben thatcher is a vastly experienced full back and is keen to offer us cover with george mccartney and jonathan spector unavailable
2608986 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2608987 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2608988 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
2608989 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines
2608990 la situaci n de los derechos humanos de los emigrantes haitianos en 2007
2608991 christians dont share tolerance as a core value increasingly we are falling into a situation where we are adopting this doctrine of tolerance which is falling well short of where christ wants us
2608992 he averaged 28 3 points a game during the regular season
2608993 most chinese fans love yao ming but they also love bryant lebron james dwight howard and carmelo anthony
2608994 if theres an olympic event where chinese will cheer for another nation its basketball
2608995 weve had several prices increases that have totaled 60 70 percent from all the manufacturers in the past year and a half so prices for most shells are going to reflect those increases
2608996 i can count the number of days on one hand where youre sweating already before the race even starts
2608997 we had ice packs on our backs already and that never happens
2608998 i dont know whether thats got anything to do with it
2608999 you cant put all the gloominess on china its a worldwide issue
2609000 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe you have to understand what liz bachman is to usa volleyball shes probably the nicest person in the entire world her and her family
2609001 her family is like our family because they traveled with us she fought in the 2004 olympics with us she was my roommate in 2004
2609002 t tais subitement crisp tas loup un mouvement sans ten rendre compte
2609003 we need major changes in the first team and everywhere
2609004 we have signed some exciting players and they will offer something different
2609005 lamentablemente mi conclusi n es que va a ser muy dif cil si no imposible encontrar puntos de coincidencia suficientes para elaborar una declaraci n conjunta
2609006 raz n para estar m s optimistas hoy de lo que est bamos ayer
2609007 demostrar autocontrol y a abstenerse de futuros actos de violencia o de fuerza
2609008 la retirada de las tropas georgianas es lo m s importante
2609009 para ir lo antes posible a la regi n y proponer a las partes involucradas algunos elementos para salir de esta crisis
2609010 un cese inmediato de las hostilidades el pleno respeto por la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia el restablecimiento de la situaci n anterior
2609011 it wont take away from the disappointment of what happened last week and i hope that will be with us for quite a while but we definitely showed a determination and it was more like last season
2609012 the biggest problem we have is that we have built up a reputation over the last 18 months and it got ruined in two games
2609013 their attitude and determination to play was something we have not had to question over the 18 months ive been the manager
2609014 obviously the two games we played over the last couple of weeks changed everyones opinion so it was good they got that back again and im sure we will go on from here
2609015 the most important thing was to see the team in a competitive game
2609016 two times we came back it was important to see the team spirit
2609017 we have spoken a lot about team spirit and being together i really appreciate the team they understand what i want and they dont have a gap between the coach and the team
2609018 our midfielders didnt want to defend and we got punished
2609019 if you have lazy players like that out on the pitch then you are always open and liable to lose goals
2609020 players who have a lazy streak wont play for my team i pointed it out to the players and they must accept what i say
2609021 it was going to have to happen one day and im glad it has finally come around
2609022 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2609023 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2609024 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2609025 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2609026 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2609027 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2609028 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2609029 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2609030 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2609031 these are always case by case bases its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2609032 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2609033 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2609034 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign i think it is always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results on to federal results or vice versa
2609035 for the first three months thereafter much more and also that doesnt include the mandatory hardware whose cost actually makes the first three months effectively more expensive even than the later ones
2609036 just as unreliable internet connection now costing more than we claim
2609037 jesus christ joy so is this it did you become the reaper after you kicked the bucket
2609038 i dont believe in god really which means i dont believe in angels per se nor did i ever think they smoked im glad they do what are you doing here
2609039 walking really isnt my thing right now joy seeing as where it got me i cant believe im going down like this i wanted to go out with a bang either a bullet or well a bang
2609040 you know ive done so much since you left and ive always thought about you these tattoos down my arm theyre for you
2609041 i really never have done too many things that im proud of i learned how to martyr myself from generations of women but thats really nothing to brag about i bounce from relationship to relationship looking for something that doesnt really exist i cant seem to fix my problems so i try to solve everyone elses i reached that point where i hit the brick wall behind the neon lights of a bar a few weeks ago though
2609042 i deserve this dont i i mean to die i was granted a gift given every opportunity afforded many priviliges and ive pissed them all away i wonder what i would have become given more time
2609043 hes starting to really lose it joy i worry i cant find a way to fix it though your mom is driving him to a deeper drinking problem i mean its not really her fault he drinks so much but her actions arent helping i feel evil thinking this but why wasnt it her shes so old and bitter so ready to go i know ive tried it before stomach pumps and stitches but i mean jesus fucking christ im not
2609044 ive had so many dreams about you so many moments when i swear youve just driven by me sorry for crying so much its embarassing really i hate to do it but i find ive been doing a lot of it in the past few months the past decade really give or take a few years ive gotten good at it ive learned to cry silently
2609045 good age is catching up with her but shes happier than shes been in a long time oh my god mom
2609046 but joy come on ive pulled my life together in the past few months things were starting to go well for me the only hitch was the whole unemployed thing but it was temporary you know that im sure the god i never believed in knows that too tell him to check his records ive paid my dues tried to make up for all the stupid shit ive pulled im not upset that im dead im upset that i never got a chance to make a few things up to a few people i had plans for fucks sake why dont you pay a visit to your mother shes ready to die been waiting on it for years now and shes ancient and evil
2609047 no not yet i guess im afraid of who ive been for most of my life afraid to confront that but i guess its too late now isnt it
2609048 joy everyone compared me to you dad your mom my mom everyone saw you in me and i was never sure if it was a good thing i think it had a lot to do with the wasted potential and the addictions i never saw it as anything horrible i saw in myself the parts of you i admired the most when i was a little girl do you see you in me
2609049 i see a lot of me in you good and bad kid it kills me at times to see how close youve come to living my mistakes but makes me proud to see that youve tasted some of the same beauty i have
2609050 well then if youre here on some mission from a god i am unsure i believe in can i ask you questions

2609058 this is shocking because i thought the government had done a lot to ensure safety
2609059 i think this might hurt chinas image in the world but i dont think itll disturb the olympics per se
2609060 laura and i were also saddened by the attack on an american family and their chinese tour guide today in beijing
2609061 the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2609062 to tell you the truth this is really a shock because theres so much security here
2609063 there are guards everywhere and cameras so im not sure how something like this could happen
2609064 i would i think because there is still national pride there
2609065 you cant let something like this change the way you live or make you shy away from being american
2609066 we do a lot of traveling this is a very big city and there are people who do bad things

2609070 china is a main contributor to the increase of the bosch business in asia we attach a special importance to the recruiting training and retaining of skilled associates
2609071 we see great growth potential in asia for all our business sectors especially as it relates to green technologies to conserve resources and protect the environment
2609072 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
2609073 too early to say whether the us delegation or athletes will require additional security
2609074 about 86 billion barrels of additional oil may lie offshore according to the us governments energy information administration
2609075 of that amount about 18 billion barrels are subject to the moratorium
2609076 almost 100 percent of the oil companies are constrained in their investment program because there is no rig available
2609077 in the u s gulf of mexico the number of rigs under contract slipped by two after two jackup contracts ended while total fleet size was unchanged with 103 of 123 mobile offshore drilling rigs under contract this week fleet utilization in the region stands at 83 7 percent
2609078 most new orders for drill ships have gone to asian shipyards companies in singapore and china have benefited but south koreas big three shipbuilders samsung heavy industries daewoo shipbuilding and marine engineering and hyundai heavy industries have gotten the bulk of orders for the most complex and expensive types of vessels
2609079 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2609080 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2609081 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2609082 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks like its eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system

2609084 io sono il signore il tuo dio che ti ho fatto uscire dal paese degitto dalla casa di schiavit

2609103 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2609104 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2609105 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2609106 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2609107 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2609108 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2609109 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2609110 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2609115 the legislation in force at the time was not sufficiently strong or comprehensive as to require companies to inform the regulator of safety information when the drug was being used for or tested outside its licensed indications
2609116 we firmly believe we acted properly and responsibly in first carrying out this important clinical trials program and then informing the regulatory agencies when we identified a potential increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in patients under 18
2609117 it is totally unacceptable to hear that when information can be made available at speed young people may have taken their own lives due to a lack of transparency by a pharmaceutical company
2609118 could and should have reported this information earlier than they did
2609119 this investigation has revealed important weaknesses in the drug safety legislation in force at the time subsequent legislation has partially addressed the problem but we will take immediate steps to ensure the law is strengthened further so that there can be no doubt as to companies obligations to report safety issues
2609120 gsk is committed to working with the government appropriate regulatory authorities and other pharmaceutical companies to take whatever action is necessary to improve legislation and policy in this area
2609121 study 329 and does justice come no it does not
2609122 they government officials wanted to know about the research glaxo did that said there were no suicidality problems and what the data really showed
2609123 were quite interested in how study 329 was used to promote paxil for teenagers and kids by clinical researchers glaxo had underwritten
2609124 we acted properly and responsibly in the conduct of our clinical trials program for paxil documentation and submission of results from studies to regulators and communication of important safety information to regulatory agencies the scientific community and the public
2609125 if the fda wanted additional information such as the internal documents you propose providing it they could have requested them from gsk
2609126 concerned that gsk could and should have reported this information earlier than they did
2609127 we know its difficult to think about the upcoming winter season while we are enjoying great summer weather
2609128 but with these higher natural gas prices we dont want customers to be caught off guard and encourage them to enroll now in the budget payment plan to avoid sticker shock with next winters bills
2609129 the budget plan coupled with energy conservation are two good tools to help manage energy bills
2609130 we see huge potential in this area and want to participate in the growth of this east region the acquisition enables brenntag to enter the market in the ukraine and substantially increases our presence in russia furthermore this cooperation is an ideal foothold to enhance brenntags attractiveness for suppliers and customers in fields such as food cosmetics construction paint amp varnish and oil amp gas we are very excited about this acquisition and we are looking forward to future development
2609131 with dipol chemical international as our partner brenntag takes a further important step in strengthening the distribution network in central and eastern europe we would like to extend a warm welcome to both employees and management of dipol
2609132 every day our teams work in hundreds of jails and prisons across the united states

2609134 we wanted to determine the top issues facing our members in order to help provide them with the education and training necessary to mitigate the challenges
2609135 by thinking green in building design and renovation companies can save energy conserve natural resources help protect the environment and make their buildings better places to work
2609136 by seeking leed recognition companies can demonstrate their commitment to the environment and the communities they call home

2609151 this show is the best way to go out of my marching career im immensely proud of everyone in our corps i cant wait to see what next year holds for the corps its going to be something big
2609152 the end of the season has been amazing for a really small drum corps doing really big things we started out with only 62 people and we made two point leaps or greater at every single show so were a 62 member corps fighting it out and winning against 145 member corps and were happy with what weve done
2609153 overall this is the best show ive ever performed and have ever been a part of im really excited i dont care for a score im just really glad we had a great show i cant wait to watch it on the dvd
2609154 today was a big show for everyone in the corps the last few years with the citations have been years of growth weve been adding members staff and new equipment and it felt really good to get all the way to the finals this year its the first time we have been there since 1986
2609155 they told us that we have the chance to go out there and really shock some people and whether they were breathing down our necks or cheering us on we wanted to make a difference we wanted to be the first spokane thunder to make it to the finals we wanted to show what we could do
2609156 todays performance was the best of the season we peaked at just the right time and the crowd really got into our show we played with a lot of emotion today because we knew it was going to be our last time together its bittersweet to be aging out right now my body needs to take a break but my soul wants to keep going
2609157 todays performance was amazing the adrenaline kicked in and i just went for it i went all the way and left it all out there on the field im speechless im so happy that we were able to get to this point and im definitely coming back next year
2609158 every second weve worked on the show has been worth it the road here has been difficult at times but im glad we are here at finals

2609283 i dont really feel like we are disappointed in anyone
2609284 because they all want to know what to do and do it fast because they all want to be good players
2609285 were going to have to look at these two early season scrimmages and make evaluations a little bit more like you would when you cut your team in the nfl
2609286 sometimes you dont keep all the best players because some younger players might not be quite as good as the veteran player at the time but you got to make a decision to invest your time in certain guys that might be able to develop and make you a better team over time and i think some of those decisions are giong to have to be made early in this camp
2609287 on third down he made some big plays out there today its a good thing that we are making big plays on offense
2609288 but i think he has done a better job of making good decisions throughout this camp
2609289 if he continues to make good decisions we are going to make big plays and minimize the bad plays
2609290 he is the guy that probably at this point and time could do the best job executing the offense

2609300 salah satunya dengan mempermudah perizinan usaha dengan menetapkan perizinan satu atap guna merangsang lebih banyak lagi para investor lokal di bidang usaha kecil dan menengah
2609301 sebaliknya keluhan terhadap gangguan dari aksi premanisme yang pada tahun sebelumnya mendominasi pada tahun ini sudah jauh berkurang seiring dengan komitmen pihak kepolisian guna memberantas premanisme di sumut
2609302 mengingat selalu turunnya tim atas instruksi kapoldasu setiap menerima laporan warga ukm menunjukkan adanya keinginan polri menghapuskan tindakan negatif yang diperbuat aparatnya di lapangan
2609303 termasuk mendesak pemerintah pusat supaya mendorong pemerintah daerah supaya segera memberlakukan sistem satu atap dalam berbagai perizinan
2609304 pemerintah harus mempunyai target kualitatif dalam menanggulangi kemiskinan sehingga dengan adanya subsidi dan pso dapat mengurangi keemiskinan membuka lapangan pekerjaan dan pembangunan didaerah perbatasan
2609305 pso merupakan dana yang sangat besar dan terkait langsung dengan kelangsungan masyarakat banyak
2609306 jika pemberian subsidi dan pso tidak diberikan maka kemungkinan angka kemiskinan akan naik
2609307 misalnya di langkat di lapangan kita masih melihat situasinya belum seperti yang diharapkan korban yang tidak ditampung dipengungsian banyak yang belum mendapat bantuan atau kalaupun ada terbilang tidak sesuai dengan kebutuhan mendesak yang dialami mereka
2609308 saya menganggap upaya yang dilakukan bupati langkat untuk membantu warganya yang tertimpa bencana memang sudah maksimal masalahnya bencana begitu luas dan korban pun begitu banyak maka wajar dia kewalahan
2609309 kita masih melihat ketimpangan dan ketidaksiapan di lapangan ini harus menjadi pelajaran ke depan jangan sampai ketika bencana datang masalah serupa masih terjadi kita memang tidak menghendaki terjadinya bencana tetapi jika bencana datang paling tidak masalah yang timbul bisa ditangani dengan baik
2609310 pemerintah harus mengedepankan aspek pelayanan terpadu yang menggabungkan instansi pusat maupun daerah
2609311 karena terlihat kepentingan pusat sangat bertentangan dengan hasrat daerah dalam memanage daerah

2609376 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2609377 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2609378 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2609379 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2609380 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2609381 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2609382 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2609383 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2609384 you would be surprised by how many womens physicians have said dont worry about it
2609385 said pam malcolm rn clinical nursing coordinator for research for the department of endocrinology at the university of california san diego
2609386 once i went off birth control pills i never had another period on my own ever again
2609387 we just dont understand yet why it works for some and why it doesnt for others
2609388 i didnt have a lifestyle that promoted health i ate fast food stayed up too late was way too stressed out so i got off the medications and i got online
2609389 i made it a habit to turn the tv off at 7 p m and i made sure i got enough sleep i was at the gym at 5 30 every morning
2609390 obese all of my life and now i am a health and fitness correspondent
2609391 dont take no from a doctor make sure you get the right tests and as much information as you can
2609392 i didnt realize i had any problem because these symptoms were too easily attributed to other causes
2609393 my weight gain was because i didnt exercise enough a few facial hairs and irregular periods were just wacky hormones my doctor wasnt concerned with the cyst so neither was i
2609394 onset of the syndrome appears to be around puberty and tends to diminish with age with ovulation starting again around 35
2609395 they dont grow out of it and these girls are often at risk for pcos
2609396 many women suffer intense feelings of isolation which lead to depression and eating disorders
2609397 pcos threatens all things female you get overweight you have to shave you get acne and you can be infertile
2609398 my doctor put me on birth control pills and aldactone an anti androgen medication to combat the hirsutism
2609399 he said id have to take them until i was ready to try and have children
2609400 i didnt have a choice my doctors werent giving me any other options
2609401 i became a fanatic i looked up every thing i read every thing i could find and i became my own advocate
2609402 every patient is different with different symptoms we need to tailor treatment to the individual needs of each patient
2609403 the most important advance in pcos has been linking the syndrome to insulin resistance
2609404 for some reason the body seems to become deaf to the actions of insulin so the pancreas speaks louder making more insulin which disrupts the bodys equilibrium
2609405 i read all the literature on the insulin connection i knew i had to get my body well
2609406 so i eliminated all refined carbohydrates and started going to the gym every morning and every night
2609407 i feel better than ever my weight has never been better and i have no cysts
2609408 metformin is an important medication for some but not for all
2609409 it got very popular on the internet yet some women dont tolerate it well
2609410 just because you have pcos it doesnt mean you cant have children
2609411 the hardest thing has been getting used to being thinner
2609412 i remember noticing men notice me for the first time i ran home
2609413 i was a very active person and i just felt myself slowing down and i didnt know why
2609414 black women who suffer with lupus are much more likely to have problems or even die from complications caused by the disorder
2609415 the 20s is typically when people are feeling like theyre healthy and invincible
2609416 i told the nurse theres something wrong with your scale
2609417 carney did the right thing by seeking more than one medical opinion
2609418 as african americans we have to be willing to tell all the symptoms we are experiencing it could be a signal that something bigger is going on inside that could become a big deal later on
2609419 when your blood sugar is elevated it damages the lining of the coronary arteries
2609420 my eating habits were absolutely atrocious and i got zero extracurricular physical activity
2609421 fried chicken fried fish lots of hot sauce i ate a lot of the wrong foods
2609422 i started going to sleep with headaches and waking up with headaches that wouldnt go away
2609423 the head nurse took my pressure and she told me i had to be hospitalized
2609424 in general african americans do not seek out medical care unless something goes wrong
2609425 hypertension is a powerful risk factor for heart disease the 40s is usually when heart disease starts manifesting in men
2609426 when i go out to eat i check the salt limits when i order french fries i tell them no salt
2609427 having an elevated blood pressure destroys the lining of the vessels that supply the heart and the vessels that supply the brain the heart has to work much harder
2609428 in the military they make you do a physical every year
2609429 i used to go to the gym play basketball and play softball i was always on the go
2609430 an african american person who gains weight and has a sedentary lifestyle is twice as likely to develop diabetes
2609431 it was very hard the first couple of times i couldnt bring myself to stick myself
2609432 its an absolute family sport a family that shoots together stays together as far as were concerned
2609433 theres a strong family oriented environment and archery is that thread that holds it all together and the olympics is that goal
2609434 i think the archery has taught them in a positive way that if you work hard and you have purposes and you set those goals and achieve them you could go from state to world champion to olympics
2609435 they didnt have regulations on how you dispose of waste and all these things in those days
2609436 regulations today are tighter on uranium mills than probably any other chemical plant in world
2609437 the u s needs to have at least some degree of production to have security of supply
2609438 these are complex facilities and they require a lot of analysis on our part
2609439 but they also require a lot of design and preparation by the companies
2609440 if they take a look at technical protections built into this mill theyll realize virtually this thing is benign when it comes to environment
2609441 i know this has occurred in the context of the olympics and that is of itself very regrettable
2609442 this has been a longstanding dispute there have been tensions between georgia and russia simmering for some time
2609443 were obviously very concerned our starting point is that we respect georgias territorial sovereignty over south ossetia
2609444 we call on all the parties to immediately engage in a ceasefire and we urge all parties to commence the dialogue
2609445 we wont be hauling anyone in well do it in the usual way
2609446 we will express privately as we are publicly our view that we want the parties to cease violence immediately and to resolve the conflict by discussion
2609447 so it wont be a matter of hauling people in it will be a matter of firmly in the usual way making our view known to the parties concerned and the international community
2609448 we think that any use of force any use of arms to resolve disputes is serious and we take it very seriously
2609449 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened

2609521 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2609522 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2609523 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself

2609535 what did you expect a handshake i dont care if he was mahatma gandhi himself anyone who tries to steal yevhens rifle and spray us with bullets gets clobbered period even if i have to belt the bastard with my own damn hands
2609536 an ak 74 in his hands wouldve done some serious damage now may i ask how are we to follow him back to the middle east he knows damn well that were not his friends anymore
2609537 were going to have to become renegades on the loose someone the whole of ukraine will want to find
2609538 hell i dont know he cant be released and he shouldnt be sent back to kerch
2609539 this is what i want you guys to do take mahmoud here back to bagerovo and have him transported to our facility in tuscany as for us give us twenty four hours then announce to the world that two arab prisoners have escaped from the main prison let the entire planet think that were armed and dangerous terrorists
2609540 jonas and i will work our way to the water and find a boat tell everyone that we were heading towards the southwest away from where were actually heading this should give us some time to formulate a plan for cycling back towards turkey perhaps through russia
2609541 what if you run into the sorcerer you know that hes still on the loose and our forces are searching every square centimeter of our country for him we cannot guarantee that you and mr prinkler will not be impeded
2609542 our plan blew wide open when this jerk here decided to make a break for it i couldnt let him start shooting now he knows that were not friendly to his aims even if he still believed that we were arabs and not americans so we have to do the next best thing we have to make other arabs believe that we are legit that we broke free from the infidels and are now hightailing our way back towards the middle east
2609543 i admit that id rather be in yokosuka listening to old petula clark tunes
2609544 great place ive been there twice on deployment way back in 1983 first to yokosuka for three months then to sasebo for a week loved the place so colorful and interesting without all the crap associated with rundown western cities i suppose that its changed a bit since ive been there but i still want to go back for a visit someday
2609545 we understand crimea is too a beautiful place communism destroyed it now the world overlooks our natural beauty someday someone smart will take advantage of how much we have to offer and we will become a marvelous resort location
2609546 for everything else crimea represents the frontline in the war against radical islam oh yeah i know turkey is our ally but they are still an islamic country ukraine represents the beginning of the christian world and well the russian government isnt exactly in bed with washington so you ukrainians are our best friends in the area too bad the u s hasnt taken the offer of developing sevastopol into a major american naval base it would benefit both our nations
2609547 our team in italy will take care of him for us
2609548 okay everythings settled tell the driver to race us to lenino and perhaps we could sneak a ride on an eastbound train from there regardless though you guys have to make the entire planet believe that we are two horrible terrorists whove broken out of jail and that were heading west
2609549 dont the terrorists know whos in their fold theyll know in an instant that were not one of them
2609550 terrorist organizations are often splintered they have their fanatics their mules their camp followers and their copycats arab terrorist organizations are even worse for theyve been reared in a culture thats fractured and tribalistic in nature in fact theyre so disorganized at the core level that arab armies havent won a war in ages they just dont have ncos like we do what this means of course is that theyll either accept us as ragtag members of someone elses outfit or theyll assume that were just freelancers hoping to make an impact for allah thats why we need to come across as renegade thugs
2609551 were going to have the entire planet after our ass and its just going to be you and me on the friendly side
2609552 it wont take away from the disappointment of what happened last week and i hope that will be with us for quite a while but we definitely showed a determination and it was more like last season
2609553 the biggest problem we have is that we have built up a reputation over the last 18 months and it got ruined in two games
2609554 their attitude and determination to play was something we have not had to question over the 18 months ive been the manager
2609555 obviously the two games we played over the last couple of weeks changed everyones opinion so it was good they got that back again and im sure we will go on from here
2609556 the most important thing was to see the team in a competitive game
2609557 two times we came back it was important to see the team spirit
2609558 we have spoken a lot about team spirit and being together i really appreciate the team they understand what i want and they dont have a gap between the coach and the team
2609559 our midfielders didnt want to defend and we got punished
2609560 if you have lazy players like that out on the pitch then you are always open and liable to lose goals
2609561 players who have a lazy streak wont play for my team i pointed it out to the players and they must accept what i say
2609562 it was going to have to happen one day and im glad it has finally come around
2609563 the preparation has been great for the past six weeks and i was quietly confident before the game that this could be the day
2609564 we need major changes in the first team and everywhere
2609565 we have signed some exciting players and they will offer something different
2609566 i want to find more about what this is about
2609567 we will be asking our general counsel to advise us on what more we should be doing about this
2609568 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
2609569 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
2609570 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
2609571 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
2609572 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
2609573 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing
2609574 sometimes i get angry at the dictionary and let loose with a muffled yell
2609575 the point at which i became bored has long since passed
2609576 human smoke the beginnings of world war ii the end of civilization
2609577 who will walk away with the first gold medal of the 2008 games
2609578 the deepest need that you and i have in weakness and adversity is not quick relief but the well grounded confidence that what is happening to us is part of the greatest purpose in the universe the glorification of the grace and power of his son the grace and power that bore him to the cross and kept him there until the work of love was done thats what god is building into our lives that is the meaning of weakness insults hardships persecution and calamity
2609579 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
2609580 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
2609581 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
2609582 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
2609583 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
2609584 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
2609585 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
2609586 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
2609587 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
2609588 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
2609589 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
2609590 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
2609591 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
2609592 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
2609593 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
2609594 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
2609595 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
2609596 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
2609597 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
2609598 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
2609599 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
2609600 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
2609601 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
2609602 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
2609603 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
2609604 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
2609605 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
2609606 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
2609607 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
2609608 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
2609609 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
2609610 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
2609611 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
2609612 hello shari we xlkjedrlkjg glass museum adnorij kweljrigh ish mvoe about 5 or 6 oclock ljklrji thirty cousfnm bye bye
2609613 now has come the time for us to attack them and they will no longer attack us from now on it is we who will march onto them bukhari
2609614 the best of the people are my generation then those who come after them then those who come after them
2609615 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2609616 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2609617 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2609618 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2609619 i dont think anythings ended my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2609620 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2609621 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2609622 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2609623 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2609624 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2609625 we know we cant turn up on sunday and say right were flying now after europe
2609626 league games have a tendency to kick you when you do well so we need to take that fighting spirit into our league games for the rest of the season
2609627 from now on it will be a relentless push to make sure we get europe next year
2609628 given the strong public interest in protecting this species its prudent for us to take more time to work with our partners to assure that we continue to take the best approach for conserving this species and its habitat
2609629 we will dump the price to wherever it needs to be in order to get to 80
2609630 if passengers are booking ahead of the 80 seat target we will close off the cheap seats if we are booking behind it we will open up more cheap fares
2609631 ultimately it is oil and the operating losses that will force some of these guys to the wall
2609632 airlines are dealing with high oil prices weakening demand and the need to maximise revenues in different ways
2609633 ba is increasing average fares but letting the number of seats sold per flight slip that does not work with ryanairs network or its product plus ryanair is trying to grow at 14 per year while ba is shrinking different growth profiles means different reactions on fares
2609634 if airlines get a break in the oil price some of them will get financing from some idiot the more expensive oil is the faster we roll up the loss making companies that are not going to survive anyway
2609635 and verily a woman need know but one man well in order to understand all men whereas a man may know all women and understand not one of them
2609636 we call on all the parties to immediately engage in a cease fire we urge all parties to commence the dialogue
2609637 the organisation for security and cooperation in europe osce has offered the finnish foreign minister to get the parties together to discuss what has been a longstanding difficult issue
2609638 the later statements that we hear especially from the international community are quite hopeful
2609639 what we right now need is at least a one day cease fire to get all the civilians out and then we can move on things from there
2609640 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are of course a crime and above all its a crime against their own people
2609641 thats because a mortal blow has been dealt to the territorial integrity of georgia itself
2609642 therefore huge damage has been inflicted on its statehood its hard to imagine how south ossetia can be convinced to be a part of the georgian state
2609643 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate moreover they are necessary in line with existing international agreements
2609644 russia is not only carrying out peacekeeping tasks but is also obliged if one of the sides violates a cease fire agreement to protect the other side
2609645 i have a mandate to to liberate the zone of conflict from violators
2609646 whatever it takes we will do the only way to stop it is for the commander in chief of the georgian army to withdraw from the area they illegally occupied
2609647 a tank assault has been stopped on the southern suburbs of tskhinvali 12 georgian tanks have been put out of action
2609648 we are defending against a georgian infantry attack that is continuing in the south of tskhinvali
2609649 we spent three days in a bunker with no lights no gas no water we have only the clothes on our backs
2609650 i thought they might be with them if theyre still alive
2609651 our husbands are not being let out even the old men
2609652 but theyve also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave
2609653 were heading back tonight but we dont know if we can get through
2609654 now people cant get out from tskhinvali even by foot
2609655 are you sure you want to upload prior period data yes or no
2609656 i think its closer now than it has ever been
2609657 there has been a lot of discussion about it and some influential people are pushing for it
2609658 i havent been as sharp as i was a month and a half or two months ago
2609659 ive been able to battle through when i get into trouble but ive got to concentrate on getting my ball down in the zone and getting ahead of batters
2609660 i told him today im not a pitching coach but id start throwing it lower
2609661 he laughed and said i think youre on to something
2609662 i may need to switch it up do something different from what i did earlier in the year because guys do sit on pitches
2609663 that happens when they see you 10 or 12 times
2609664 but ive caught eddie and his stuff is heeaa veee
2609665 ive played catch with him and i dont play catch with him anymore
2609666 we were just talking he seemed like a pretty good guy
2609667 and out of nowhere he says i hate you he said he hated facing me i guess hed been swinging pretty good at the time thats what he told me but he said then i faced you and its like my bat just stopped when it got to the ball
2609668 i still have confidence that i can turn this around
2609669 ive got a loop in my swing and im trying to fix it
2609670 i have to try to find a way to keep my hands up
2609671 he could be hitting better right now with a little luck
2609672 i see now that its sometimes good to relax and watch a baseball game
2609673 i see how important it is now i really do
2609674 they said theyd like to meet me for lunch at a restaurant in tampa
2609675 so i went there and thats where they retired my number
2609676 for me i want to see how he responds after playing in games
2609677 well just see how hes doing well probably evaluate him after three or four games speed up the process slow it down or whatever
2609678 the whole key to that will be to keep everybody fresh
2609679 if we can do that we can have some value there we can have an asset instead of not
2609680 from a managers point of view if im sitting in the other dugout im thinking i have an out there
2609681 and i dont want to waste another pitcher because david wrights on deck easily could have been blown up by wright there just because murphy walked a very professional at bat
2609682 id like to say hey come sit at your locker put your uniform on
2609683 its very very very kind of a position where you have to wait for how a guy feels but hes one of those guys who you just cant afford to lose
2609684 i dont think ive had an honor that will compare i dont think i ever will it is probably my highest honor that i will achieve
2609685 but i got caught up in here with the coat and i missed the catcher by 10 feet
2609686 its not your typical major league baseball city the fans adore their players whether it be the ravens the colts or the orioles its just a special bonding with the people here in baltimore and i never found that anywhere else maybe because it was my first place but i dont think that was what it was they just have a special fan base here and it meant a lot to play here
2609687 but to be in a place like baltimore and to do what nobody remotely expects you to do and then you couple it with your rookie season so everything is new and fun it was a great great season
2609688 i had the middle of the lineup with a one run lead and it was mark mcgwire dave parker and dave henderson
2609689 i went somewhere and then the next year or two years they went to the world series or won the world series
2609690 you almost knew all the fans because they were accessible half the time the players parking lot was in the middle of the regular parking lot so you go to know everybody outside the park after the game you werent above you werent anything you were just somebody they came to watch
2609691 i try not to dwell on it but im truly very honored that these people would do this
2609692 i knew the guy that the award is named for herb armstrong and there arent many people left in the organization who knew him
2609693 it seems very strange to be in the spotlight hopefully in the next short period of time the light will go off and i can go back to being what i was before which is the traveling secretary
2609694 the phillies are an organization i always held in high regard and its the kind of organization that has the same faces through the years from the receptionists to the secretaries
2609695 there are a lot of similarities between the cities pittsburgh and philadelphia both cities have great passionate sports fans that care about their teams and care about winning
2609696 as i was coming home i heard the roar of jets
2609697 i fell to the ground instinctively and then there were these painfully loud bangs
2609698 they were such lovely people they were so excited about the baby
2609699 i just wanted to come out and have a good start here
2609700 show that i can pitch in an atmosphere like this
2609701 it gives you that kind of comfort as a manager
2609702 you know im going to sit back here if they get a run were going to score one or two more but i think pauley is going to keep us in the ballgame and thats what he did
2609703 coming into this situation youre kind of out of your normal routine so i watched david upstairs and he sat around for a couple hours when we got here
2609704 so you have that wonderment in your mind watching him hes gotten to the point where hes professionalized himself
2609705 hes got a feel for the curveball and the feel for the change and that makes him dangerous against left handed hitters but the biggest thing with david is his composure and his ability to execute location
2609706 i kind of got behind some guys but battled back and got some outs when i needed them
2609707 and i think i can pitch at this level and have success
2609708 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2609709 vince fears tna tna hard justice 8 10 08 only on ppv
2609710 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2609711 its going to be a tough one but im sure going to give him a run for his money
2609712 its always great to get the first race over and done with
2609713 but a few things went wrong there and still going in fastest qualifier for the semifinal its great to know that i have something to improve on
2609714 obviously having the heats at night shakes things up a little bit i know i have more than that in me
2609715 i knew it would be quick but not quite that quick
2609716 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2609717 its going to be a tough one but im sure going to give him a run for his money
2609718 its always great to get the first race over and done with
2609719 but a few things went wrong there and still going in fastest qualifier for the semifinal its great to know that i have something to improve on
2609720 obviously having the heats at night shakes things up a little bit i know i have more than that in me
2609721 i knew it would be quick but not quite that quick
2609722 if one book can help you master vista this is it
2609723 giving up her privacy sustained time off and any remnants of work family boundaries at all
2609724 youre going to burn a hole through that paper if you kept that up keegan
2609725 im trying to jot down a good driving course after i find where they all live
2609726 and that map to the stars really pulls it off accuracy i think
2609727 if im going to get the ugh super group together again i have to
2609728 too bad we cant use you for my paper next week
2609729 we have more important things to worry about than a stupid college class cooper
2609730 half our classmates are probably already under the spell of that
2609731 come on the only way to make it more accessible is to put it in beer then theyd really guzzle it down
2609732 hes not too far from us still in oregon thats good
2609733 why do i get the feeling youre going to be asking for me to drive you in the next five seconds
2609734 fine but i want to hit around town like a normal person our age not some science geek with a martyr complex okay
2609735 well i hope you all didnt come because theres a new juice out there to make me popular
2609736 this is a 1966 lincoln continental 4 door convertible in cherry red keegan its a work for art
2609737 are you going to go in or are you going to stand there like a jackass
2609738 i need to convince him i dont want to blurt out and ask for his autograph
2609739 but if he gives it to you thatd be great
2609740 whatever can this serious business go quicker i wanted to head to the mall before it closes
2609741 cooper this could be the fate of the world and youre worried about the mall
2609742 what i meant to say was that my name is sam keegan i wanted to talk to you theres a new threat emerging and you need to get the super group back together
2609743 i came to you first because you were the leader you took gwen remy marco espinosa alice staton and tommy kincaid into the reaches of the unknown and stopped a global threat against everyone twice
2609744 look mr clay i dont know if youre worried about not being young enough or not but if so dont be you are adrian clay youve saved the world twice you even took on the cult leader by yourself in the end
2609745 you sure the government cant handle this threat thats got you all riled up

2609747 did you and a group of people you soon called friends save the world twice
2609748 all right why dont you tell me what this great threat of yours is
2609749 okay kid if you can convince the others im in
2609750 why do i feel like were not going to the mall
2609751 a coward implies i might actually feel guilt about not walking into a giant death trap
2609752 traffic is ridiculous out here and the meters are charging more than our tuition put together
2609753 this better not be about those admissions fee i dont care what gwen says i am not paying any of this gringo shit school for my kids theyre mine so its not like their genetics are going to change them into rocket scientists or something
2609754 my name is sam keegan i i adrian clay sent me
2609755 i didnt get the note that youd traded me in for a cocker spaniel or do your people only do chi wow wahs
2609756 cant you tell that its affecting peoples minds your parents have been prey to that with the cult juice before
2609757 yeah i cant tell the difference if theyre brain dead or not
2609758 what do you want us to do about this sammy

2609761 you say it again even repeating and ill do the same to you got it
2609762 now were mom and dad with a mortgage the only thing we had to lose was each other back then
2609763 but you have to who else is going to save the world thats what you
2609764 what we do is make movies off a bunch of circumstances that happened to happen twice
2609765 and make a lot of money off them plus perks
2609766 so easy to get citizenship when youre a genuine ce le brit y
2609767 keep at it kid determination works everything out in the end one way or another
2609768 i believe your suggested draft had you impersonating indiana jones and han solo
2609769 we have to get alice on board thatll bring them all together
2609770 im not ruining my future would you just put luke on the phone
2609771 yeah i love you too mom now hand the phone over hey luke
2609772 well its not my fault if mom drives you crazy about it we needed the time you know i work hard enough on a triple major and keegan goes crazy if he doesnt get fresh air every decade
2609773 dawn says youre on a road trip to save the world is this why our cable cord was cut
2609774 im just worried that youre taking this hero worship a little too far
2609775 sam im glad you didnt end up hating them for what happened
2609776 i used whatever device i could to get through it
2609777 look im not telling you to come home youre all grown up and making stupid decisions like you should be
2609778 im just saying please when youre done with this when your heroes dont live up to expectations start living up to yourself
2609779 we shouldnt be too long were going to see alice staton next
2609780 call to check in or ill send in the reserve
2609781 oh come on its not like the history channel is going to have
2609782 what first theres an army of kids and then an army of brain washed nerds please and thank yous keeg that doesnt seem likely
2609783 alice was always quiet so when she did talk it always meant something not that adrian ever needed it but al was always the one to talk him down when he did i respect that though man if theres ever a girl that wont laugh at your jokes thats her and thats an ego blow jokes are all ive got
2609784 uh my names sam keegan you dont know me but i i really need to speak with you
2609785 lives are counting on it i cant say much here
2609786 you can take your shoes off and grab a seat mr keegan
2609787 you i mean you can call me sam al miss staton
2609788 its ms actually you should study up on your feminism
2609789 ms staton i know its been a long time but once you and your friends saved the world no one does that but you did you helped people without their asking people would have died if it werent for you you tried to help them you were the right people at the right time twice and it needs it again and youre my last hope i have to convince you theres nothing else to do
2609790 i dont watch television but i read the paper ive seen the signs before
2609791 sam do you know what i did after our second adventure
2609792 rassla demor got a slap on the wrist for his first crimes they put him in jail for the criminally insane they put him in jail and then he came out and he killed thomas
2609793 i know he i mean i dont know exactly but you have
2609794 dont ask me what youre going to ask me sam it isnt all games and movies and television like gwen and marco seem to think
2609795 its real life and real people and real friends and they die and other people have to risk it weve done enough ive done enough tommy did enough
2609796 all i can do now is make sure those bastards that get put away never meet parole and never end another tommy kincaid
2609797 other people arent my friends other people arent my soul other people arent tommy
2609798 you need to get out of this while you still can sam i recognized you that look on your face when you were just a child its dangerous you need to get out now
2609799 but i cant not until you guys are back not until its safe
2609800 why what happened to tommy that was so terrible he died a hero what was so terrible about his death that you dont care about anyone else anymore
2609801 your grade point average seems to prove that yeah super genius
2609802 i know what its like losing a parent to a war i saw your face when you watched that woman put all her energy into saving your mom i know how bad its always hurt you but they werent soldiers they picked up duty on their own it doesnt make them better and it doesnt make them worse but it does mean they dont have to do this for the rest of their lives you dont need them
2609803 you can hack probably any computer if you get enough ibuprofen
2609804 mom almost had a chance with them we just stood there and did nothing
2609805 theyre not real sam theyre constructs you made up when you were still playing with hotwheels stop trying to grab onto a kids desperate dream and grow up
2609806 you have to talk to them you have to talk to marco and gwen and tell them theyre not too old and that they need to protect their families and you have to talk to mad at you for tommy you have to get them together youre the leader theyll listen to you theyll listen to
2609807 then why why did you send me out there this is important theres no time to run around like an idiot after them im not just making this up
2609808 i thought if you talked to them youd get it
2609809 i deserve to know at least that what was so horrible that all of you are running scared youve been through so much and came out at the end better for it tommy died but he died a hero
2609810 gwen thought i couldnt handle the real one or maybe she couldnt
2609811 its always easy when the choice is you or someone else
2609812 demor hated me more than anything and anyone else after i stopped him the first time
2609813 if it had been a choice between me or tommy or me or alice heartbeat answer id have picked them i guess as a hero
2609814 its easy to pick that choice my lifes not the problem i risked it all the time for fun
2609815 man was literally an evil genius he made me pick between alice and tommy made me pick which of the two people i loved the most in the world would die or they both would
2609816 no one should ever have to make that choice sam
2609817 can still get them together alice still cares about you she has to youre the super group youre youre magic
2609818 these things work themselves out sam groups of people in the right circumstances come together and work out the universe settles itself but theres too high a price you have to know what youre getting into
2609819 i do and i cant again none of us can
2609820 you have to let it go sam we dont work the same anymore the military the ones that werent affected
2609821 those are the ones that made it though the ones that should handle it now if theres something going on there are better trained people that a bunch of stupid kids who accidentally got something that made them a little more special than the rest of the world
2609822 ive seen that face that look you have its nothing compared to when its
2609823 i dont think were enough on our own but were all we got and enough
2609824 i saw her get hit by the truck and then the ambulance came

2609830 i know it might sound like its a suffering of some kind but its really fun work
2609831 weve done surveys in the past marketing surveys and tigers have always been the number one thing that people want to see
2609832 thats the exciting thing we want to have tigers it makes sense to have tigers here theyre a good year round viewing animal
2609833 thats a lie i never threatened anybody with lawsuits i saw what i believed to be a civil rights violation
2609834 based on my training there was no probable cause for them to search that trunk
2609835 were hoping to start the process for them to get housing and kind of coordinate the needs they have from there and kind of follow them to make sure that they do get the help that they need
2609836 the police department or whoever comes across someone who is homeless would know that they need to send them to ruth meiers and well start the process and go from there

2609849 according to the latest information available the city continues to resist the incursion of georgian troops and has still not been captured
2609850 the georgian foces shelled tskhinvali all night intermittently for about one hour or one and a half each time at times stopped by backfire from the defense forces 70 of city buildings are now destroyed the situation is very tough
2609851 south ossetia still controls tskhinvali the artillery shelling was on and off at night the civilians kept hiding in the basements many apartment blocks were on fire all night long and the fire could not be put out because of lack of water supply still the georgian media go on claiming that the control over tskhinvali belongs to georgia last night the broadcasting of all russian tv channels over georgia was discontinued
2609852 some explosions heard here and there the bakery now works in the city in the morning people had a chance to come out and get some bread the ex neighbors regrouped and now tend to hide in the same basements no power in the city the retreating georgians took hostage some city inhabitants their number cannot be determined the tskhinvalians blocked the basements doors as they could and prepared some axes to avoid abuse it is rumored they cut the heads off to the hostages last night the georgian tanks kept firing at the few still standing apartment blocks in the city smashed georgian tanks can be seen on the streets you can also see a destroyed bmp on the southern outskirts with some dead bodies nearby
2609853 tskhinvali is under heavy artillery fire coming from the direction of the georgian villages
2609854 the georgian snipers keep firing at vehicles transporting the wounded to the hospitals of south ossetia
2609855 the women and children in tskhinvali suffer of thirst the city has not had any access to water gas electricity for 3 days the cell phones are losing power the georgian snipers shoot anyone who tries to get out into the street
2609856 an intense massive shelling of living blocks of the city by georgian forces using mortars artillery bmps tanks and the grad missile launch systems is on the shells are coming in bursts the intervals between the bursts are less than a second
2609857 tskhinvali is under control of the south ossetian forces but the extermination of the georgian gun layers who coordinate the fire on the city continues
2609858 some shelling to the houses near the border fire and smoke everywhere the exact number of victims is unknown to me its quite clear this war is not aimed to achieve some kind of political victory this war is aimed to completely exterminate the civilian population
2609859 about 5000 civilians remain in tskhinvali whose evacuation is not possible at the moment the georgian side continues to bomabard the territory with all weapons available including the grad launch rocket systems howitzers and tanks the road to the city is under heavy fire tbilisi should provide at least a 2 3 hours corridor to evacuate the wounded
2609860 he remodeled it to make it where people could go inside if you saw it before and looked in it after he was through it was daylight and dark
2609861 tom was involved in key club german club and band making all region band his sophomore year
2609862 he was a wonderful young man those that knew him knew he was funny and outgoing
2609863 he was very polite and respectful i cant think of him ever overreacting he had a wonderful good natured personality
2609864 its a terrible tragedy he was a great young man
2609865 the selective overlooking or ignoring of events or acts that are not favorable or useful to ones purpose or position
2609866 a fight ensued during which police said walsh punched ramirez in the face the victim fell and hit his head on the street leaving him unconscious after which piekarsky kicked him in the head police said
2609867 pretty much describes chaos and what you have then after the fact is somebody trying to sort through that and attribute certain acts to certain individuals
2609868 i think any time theres a fight and any time you have one ethnic group fighting another theres going to be racial slurs
2609869 ive seen that since i was a kid on a playground 20 years ago but they never called it ethnic intimidation until very recently
2609870 i plan on moving out of this town as fast as i can not because im scared i just dont want to see my children have to deal with what their father dealt with
2609871 hes not a delegate or an alternate delegate and its more important for him to spend the time in the state campaigning
2609872 the one danger udall faces is overconfidence there is a whiff of hubris among some of his supporters as he trounces pearce in all the polling but political pros are not among them they believe this race will get closer how much is the question maybe top democrats in washington agree why else would they announce they are spending valuable campaign cash from the dem senate campaign committee to launch nm tv ads on behalf of udall yes udall had nearly 3 million in the bank recently and is way ahead in all the surveys but what if wealthy pearce starts to close and then writes a personal check for big dollars the liberals and progressives who think tom has this one in the bag have good reason to think that but those who are responsible for bringing the race home cannot afford to act like it a tv buy from the national ds even for an already well funded udall seems prudent in a democratic state in which the rs still control the majority of the congressional seats

2609914 debtor empires sooner or later have to do more than just sell shares to satisfy their creditors
2609915 do you honestly believe that any of these criminals will suffer the slightest discomfort
2609916 the sheer nmbers involved overloaded their ability both mentally and electronically to handle the attack
2609917 the whole thing was over in five maybe ten minutes
2609918 could be a significant threat especially in combination with other platforms

2609922 america deceived from amazon stealing private lands kelo decision warrant less wiretapping and refusing to investigate 9 11 properly they are both guilty of treason
2609923 not all that much different from what weve got now
2609924 lets think hard about what 60 years of military centric foreign policy has got us
2609925 honestly id just as soon vote for his speechwriter for president as for him
2609926 what i do is to sit with him for half an hour
2609927 i in mid 2002 thanks to leads from a variety of detainees the us disrupted a plot by 9 11 mastermind ksm to attack targets on the west coast of the united states using hijacked airplanes
2609928 it doesnt really give us any more indication of whether this was a plot that was derailed or preempted or a plot that was more in the realm of an idle daydream
2609929 maybe theyre tired of talking about the brooklyn bridge and theyre trying to find a different edifice of some sort
2609930 there is no question in my mind that this is a disruption its not about credit its about protecting the american people and the american people are absolutely safer as a result of these arrests
2609931 the 2004 uk urban targets plot in mid 2004 the us and its counter terrorism partners disrupted a plot that involved attacking urban targets in the united kingdom with explosive devices
2609932 the director of national inteligence report tells us ksms network was behind this attack and so we are led to believe water boarding this human scum lead to an intelligence breakthrough and yet ksm wasnt captured until march of 03 go figure

2609941 what he is criticizing is the use of the doomsday
2609942 one example out of many comes in ron suskinds gripping narrative of what the white house has celebrated as one of the wars major victories the capture of abu zubaydah in pakistan in march 2002
2609943 abu zubaydah his captors discovered turned out to be mentally ill and nothing like the pivotal figure they supposed him to be
2609944 abu zubaydah also appeared to know nothing about terrorist operations rather he was go to guy for minor logistics travel for wives and children and the like
2609945 how could this have happened why are we learning about it only now those questions form the spine of suskinds impressively reported book
2609946 in interviews with intelligence officers suskind often finds them baffled by white house statements
2609947 many legal scholars and intelligence experts say padillas ordeal highlights the danger of a government that obtains information through secret coercive means and then selectively releases some of it to justify its actions
2609948 although they seek a life sentence prosecutors introduced no evidence of personal involvement by padilla in planning or carrying out any specific terrorist plot or violent act
2609949 there is a reason the governments case is so thin legal analysts say
2609950 if prosecutors brought the dirty bomb plot or other alleged illegal actions by padilla into the miami case it would open the door for courtroom scrutiny of the governments use of coercive interrogation techniques against al qaeda suspects including padilla
2609951 this is a part of the war on terror the bush administration would rather keep quiet but details are emerging
2609952 the padilla story burst into the national consciousness in june 2002 when then attorney general john ashcroft interrupted a trip to moscow to make a dramatic televised announcement
2609953 we have disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the united states by exploding a radioactive
2609954 what he didnt say was that padilla had been locked in a solitary confinement cell in new york city for the past month and that padilla was only now being taken into military custody on the eve of a scheduled court hearing that would have required the government to legally justify padillas continued detention
2609955 instead president bush declared padilla an enemy combatant who posed a continuing present and grave danger to us national security the president said padilla possessed intelligence information that could help prevent al qaeda attacks on the us
2609956 some officials offered a less dramatic take on the dirty bomb plot than mr
2609957 nonetheless the dirty bomb announcement sent shock waves across the country and immediately helped justify the use of coercive interrogation techniques against padilla analysts say
2609958 the dirty bomb stigma would later help the government battle constitutional challenges to padillas military detention according to many legal scholars
2609959 the dirty bomb allegation emerged from information obtained through a bush administration innovation in the war on terror
2609960 no judge in an american courtroom could permit the introduction of information gathered under such coercive techniques in part because they carry a high risk of producing unreliable results
2609961 when federal bureau of investigation agents first took padilla into custody administration officials thought they had nabbed an intelligence prize
2609962 you dont go on the internet and spend a day reading and become an expert on how to put together a dirty bomb says larry johnson the counterterrorism expert im not knocking folks who work at taco bell but thats not a place youd go to ramp up your skills as a nuclear jihadist
2609963 the underlying information about jose padillas alleged dirty bomb plot came primarily from three individuals according to a federal bureau of investigation affidavit on file in mr
2609964 mr mohammed made a public statement at guant namo earlier this year claiming to be in charge of dirty bomb operations on american soil mohammeds own shower of extravagant claims of whom we have no idea what fraction were actually truthful is now famous moomaw
2609965 mr zubaydah reportedly talked about the plot early on in his interrogation
2609966 the third individual an ethiopian refugee to britain named binyam mohammed does not deny making statements about padilla and a dirty bomb plot according to his lawyer clive stafford smith
2609967 when khalid sheikh mohammed the architect of the sept 11 attacks was waterboarded he revealed valuable details about the operations of al qaida the bush administration says but cia agents say mohammed also confessed that al qaida was plotting to kill former presidents clinton and carter and pope john paul ii making them realize that he was inventing sensational information to satisfy his interrogators
2609968 if someone a president a general a policeman feels that it is so important to use torture in order to save countless lives a la jack bauer then let him or her suffer the consequences and be charged with a crime
2609969 one cia official cautioned that many of mohammeds claims during interrogation were
2609970 on march 19 2007 ahmed omar saeed sheikhs lawyers cited mohammeds confession in defense of their client ahmed omar saeed sheikh also known as sheikh omar was sentenced to death in a pakistani court for the murder of daniel pearl omars lawyers recently announced that they planned to use mohammeds confession in an appeal they had always acknowledged that omar played a role in pearls murder but argue that mohammed was the actual murderer
2609971 owned by the jewish former u s secretary of state henry kissinger
2609972 if someone a president a general a policeman feels that it is so important to use torture in order to save countless lives a la jack bauer then let him or her suffer the consequences and be charged with a crime
2609973 do you know how profoundly ignorant and weak and stupid you sound
2609974 if someone a president a general a policeman feels that it is so important to use torture in order to save countless lives a la jack bauer then let him or her suffer the consequences and be charged with a crime
2609975 i certainly agree with you that water boarding as a tactic should be used only in special cases
2609976 sleep deprivation is one of the most excruciating forms of torture
2609977 you wont get someone to do my kind of job well unless they get a kick out of it
2609978 waterboarding is not the first option its the last after everything else has been tried and failed repeatedly
2609979 rather we should set up the virtuous as our examples to emulate and shun the actions of the depraved while praying for their remorse that there may be hope for them in gods grace
2609980 people who advocate terror such as neill here stalin in time past and dozens nay hundreds of others are not all members of a cohesive group of
2609981 waterboarding is not the first option its the last after everything else has been tried and failed repeatedly
2609982 tried and failed repeatedly to do what extract information from someone who doesnt have any real information to offer
2609983 tried and failed repeatedly to extract information from a high value prisoner who then spills on 6 of his co conspirators
2609984 in actual practice we find that bushs administration has tortured men who not only didnt know anything about what they were being tortured about but werent even affiliated with al qaeda
2609985 let me say that again bushs administration has tortured men who were factually innocent not men who got off on technicalities factually innocent
2609986 justifiable torture demands that the government be certain of the following things this man is who we think he is
2609987 youve left out another crucial premise so ksm or some other torturee gives up information
2609988 1 why exactly would ksm give up reliable information rather than information that will make the waterboarding stop for now
2609989 2 how exactly would the government be able to know that the information was reliable or correct in any way in time to stop this hypothetical attack disaster
2609990 so far as i can tell the only way for all these conditions to be fulfilled even once let alone very time the government has a whim to question someone they suspect of possible knowledge of an attack would be reliable magic or omniscience which would make the whole water boarding thing rather redundant
2609991 people who have realized that this is a dream imagine that it is easy to wake up and are angry with those who continue sleeping not considering that the whole world that environs them does not permit them to wake life proceeds as a series of optical illusions artificial needs and imaginary sensations
2609992 it is possible to lead astray an entire generation to strike it blind to drive it insane to direct it towards a false goal napoleon proved this
2609993 when will large swaths of the american public cease behaving like a cowering mass
2609994 much as youre confused or is it disturbed by a seemingly blind attachment of some aggressive democratists shouldnt you attend to the more compelling toxic propensity that lingers within the jihadists
2609995 jihadists cant destroy the constitution they can only kill a small number of our 300 million citizens we survived the deaths of vietnam ww2 ww1 the civil war etc other nations have survived even greater death tolls and have come back after the destruction of entire cities there is simply no way jihadists can do any significant damage to us as a nation its the gop and the fearful who are stabbing the founders in the back and throwing away what they accomplished the constitution that makes us america which separates us from russia or china
2609996 these guys do not play small ball to coin a phrase
2609997 olson was also a major player in stealing the vote in florida in 2000
2609998 its the gop and the fearful who are stabbing the founders in the back and throwing away what they accomplished the constitution that makes us america which separates us from russia or china
2609999 in other words it wasnt al qaeda that created the tyranny but the other way around supporting musharraf is also a bad idea
