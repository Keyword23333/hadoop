8360000 one of the single most important features that wika has optimized is the capability of selltis sales to handle quotes
8360001 plus the reporting is unbelievable even canned reports are useful and easily customized for filtering
8360002 the system is so intuitive that we are able to continually customize the selltis system if we want a different view or need to add a hot button for a sic code we can customize it easily
8360003 selltis was even willing to customize our views so we could see users companies projects sales calls and link them to automatically send out to do items if one of our sales reps is out sick another exec can easily follow up on the opportunity since the item automatically appears on their to do list as well
8360004 previously if quotes were lost then so was the ensuing business now we can review the entire history of a specific opportunity and determine lessons learned and areas of improvement
8360005 we can also conduct forward planning based on sales history and prepare us today for the opportunities of tomorrow
8360006 we would never return to the manual process of keeping records four years ago we would run to a cabinet and review paper reports and now we have instant access that alone provides huge time and cost savings

8360013 im a big racing fan i love all elements of the sport and thats why for me it was great to get all styles of racing into one package for us it is a big new thing a new franchise and we wanted to move a little bit away from our toca roots which have always been grounded very much in the touring car angle
8360014 our whole philosophy is that its about the racing thats whats were all about
8360015 when we first set out to make the game we took a long hard look at what was happening in the world of racing games at that time and what we saw was a lot of games doing modding a lot of games about creating your car and putting pretty patterns on the side of it none of them appeared to be focusing on the core which is fast exciting aggressive racing we decided that was what we wanted to do and wanted to try and distil that into your 5 to 6 minute experience and get back to what racing is all about
8360016 its a big question and theres quite a lot of diversity coming in especially if you look at games like burnout and test drive theyve brought the whole open environment angle to it and they have their place
8360017 the ego engine is evolving all the time its was in development for over two years before the launch of grid i think weve taken a real step up from what you saw in dirt even with just a year between the two titles there are always going to be new features and improvements that we can make weve had 50 to 60 engineers working on ego over its two years so if we can continue at that rate the sky is almost the limit im of the opinion that it is absolutely the finest racing game engine in the world today and i think that if you look at the visuals in grid itll be hard for anyone to argue
8360018 theres a dozen things we can do online weve got literally pages and pages of great ideas of how we can do that
8360019 my personal goal for that if weve got it would be to get their ghost laps and make them uploadable so the world could upload that lap and it would be a challenge they could see how they did it and have a go i think that will be cool if only to see how much better they are than me
8360020 the sense of always looking at oneself through the eyes of others of measuring ones soul by the tape of a world that looks on with bemused contempt and pity
8360021 when you control a mans thinking you do not have to worry about his actions you do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder he will find his proper place and will stay in it you do not need to send him to the back door he will go without being told in fact if there is no back door he will cut one for his special benefit his education makes it necessary
8360022 history has shown the top guys have blown it in the first couple of events
8360023 the first shot i was too aggressive on the trigger i wasnt settled into my hold and it was a four and that really really unnerved me
8360024 my next shot i came onto the target and i wasnt looking at the sights because i was so distracted and i shot a six
8360025 i sat myself down calmed down and said youre better than this
8360026 i refocused and shot a lot better but i dropped 10 points in the first two shots and you cant do that and expect to do well at the olympics
8360027 had i had a better shoot i think the fence would have gone better too
8360028 as much as you would like to think that the sports dont interact with each other when youre having a great day it just continues to build on itself
8360029 when youre having a bad day its real hard to pick yourself up by the bootstraps four more times
8360030 i cant expect to come out of a shoot like that and do well i knew right after that it would be virtually impossible to pull back up
8360031 actually it was my best swim since ive been in pentathlon but even that was a little off i swam a 2 02 and i was aiming for about 2 minutes had the day been a little more optimal had preparations of the last couple of weeks with travel and all that gone a little better i think it could have been closer to 2 minutes
8360032 i was coming off of a very strong performance in the world championships which is probably harder than the olympics
8360033 i didnt rest for it and got 12th i just did everything right there and then kind of did the opposite here just had the opposite day
8360034 i tried to fight as much as i could and i was pretty proud of the fact that i didnt give up
8360035 i love the city and its been a lot of fun to be here
8360036 its been a fantastic experience being in the olympics its a dream come true from that point of view its possible that ill compete on to 2012 about six months ago i was saying absolutely not but im definitely not writing it off now
8360037 i think ive got a lot better performance in me than we saw today so i wouldnt mind taking another crack at it and ending the career on a higher note
8360038 that right there is kind of motivating to me i dont like to go out on a low note
8360039 theyre really the reason im here its just impossible for me to do this sport without their support its been terrific to represent them and this week has been awesome
8360040 but ive probably gotten 50 e mails from servicemembers who i didnt even know who are e mailing from around the world from qatar to maxwell air force base in alabama to a former first sergeant whos now a chief master sergeant who sent me an e mail i havent talked to him in seven years and he sent me an e mail saying hey congratulations on making the olympics i always knew you could do it so having the air force as a backer has been terrific
8360041 its a tough sport financially its a tough sport emotionally and physically and youve got to have to have a strong background cast
8360042 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
8360043 were seeing aip in iowa and a particular sweet potato mold has been shown to cause clinical signs of aip
8360044 cattle eructate hydrogen sulfide gas and the inhalation of that gas may cause lung damage
8360045 sulfur is normally absorbed through the rumen wall but eructated hydrogen sulfide gas can damage the respiratory cilia
8360046 high sulfur may cause hoof problems because it can potentially tie up zinc and even copper
8360047 some researchers are looking at high sulfate feeds and how they may contribute to zinc or copper deficiencies
8360048 we will be monitoring this in cattle because were using a lot more corn syrup in cow diets this year as a cheap source of feed
8360049 predictions based on the clinical intuition of veterinarians regarding the bvdv status of herds is poorly sensitive and poorly specific
8360050 the most critical need for bvdv control is a validated strategy to determine the bvdv status of cattle herds we cannot be sure which actions to take until we reliably know if the virus is in the herd and without a reliable measure of herd status it is impossible to measure progress
8360051 a herd with very little exposure but excessive open cow numbers in my mind is high risk
8360052 it is important to note that incidental contact with the neighbors cattle across the fence is recognized as exposure even though they are not moving in and out of the herd in question
8360053 low risk to me would be a closed herd that is on a sound vaccination program
8360054 there are no closed herds in this area my strategy has been to develop vaccinations programs to minimize risk and implement testing on an as needed basis
8360055 there are some parts of our community that do not like being part of a public school district

8360063 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8360064 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8360065 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8360066 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8360067 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8360068 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8360074 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8360080 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

8360085 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8360089 the word towelhead is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
8360090 the use of such a derogatory term by a major film studio will serve to increase its acceptability in public discourse

8360110 the above i say as a historian what follows is my nonacademic opinion
8360111 i cannot truly assess obamas position in the history of modern liberalism
8360112 i can do this i know the product will be flawed by what is unknowable and indeed by other constraints inherent to the subject but it will be worth doing because i have historical expertise that may be useful to the public

8360114 you cant say im a professor at ivy league u because it will compromise my integrity
8360115 next time please write university of oxford not oxford university
8360116 as scholars and educational officers college and university teachers should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances hence they should at all times be accurate should exercise appropriate restraint should show respect for the opinions of others and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the institution

8360128 so that if i dont have a budget i cannot speak at the convention

8360193 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8360194 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8360195 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8360196 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8360204 it is foolhardy to talk about another referendum at this stage unless something fundamental changes to attempt to rerun a referendum as a means of reversing the democratic decision taken by the people would be rightly regarded as an affront something fundamental will have to be changed in the nice treaty before we can even contemplate putting it before the people again
8360205 so far as the nice treaty is concerned the irish people have spoken and like it or lump it the commission and its president have to accept it they should do so with more good grace than they have shown in the recent past the nice treaty no matter what its good intentions is a document that has been democratically tested in only one member state and that is ireland it failed to meet the democratic test in this nation it is an arrogance for any politician either here or any commissioner in europe to ignore the fundamental fact that the irish people have spoken with some clarity on the matter yet last night the president of the commission suggested that somehow or other the irish peoples will can be undone if the commission its leaders or the governments of other european states decide to sweep democracy aside we must ask on what basis is the future of europe to be built over the past two days i attended a meeting of the interim european security and defence assembly i was amazed and gratified in equal measure at the response by european parliamentarians from 28 different european nations to the irish referendum it was an interesting and extraordinary eye opener there was no finger wagging or suggestion that our people had been wrong or were confused rather there was a degree of admiration for the decision the irish had made speakers from the united kingdom to slovenia to greece spoke on the issue they indicated their support for the right of the irish people to make a decision on this matter they were by no means all euro sceptics speakers from a number of countries both within and outside the union indicated that the irish people by its vote reflected a common view and concern that now exists both within the eu and in those states most proximate to the eu members from the eu states who contributed directly in the debate or who spoke privately to the irish delegation members indicated that it was their view i made an effort to do a straw poll that referenda on the nice treaty as it currently stands if held in other member states would meet with the same public response as in ireland there is something distinctly odd about democratic states attempting to take decisions that are out of line with the sentiment of their citizens the gulf that exists between the citizens of europe and the institutions the commissioners and the bureaucrats who are now driving the union is nowhere more visible than in the area of peace security and defence in the run up to the nice treaty the european council decided quite incredibly that somehow the european union could now take charge of peace security and defence issues across the continent of europe both within and outside the union the issues raised by the rejection of the nice treaty in the referendum are of a fundamental nature i have listened with some dismay to todays debate and the debate that has taken place in the weeks since the referendum many in the political leadership of the nation are more focused on making a political point about the referendum than on truly addressing the core issues behind the judgement passed by the people it is foolhardy to talk about another referendum at this stage unless something fundamental changes to attempt to rerun a referendum as a means of reversing the democratic decision taken by the people would be rightly regarded as an affront something fundamental will have to be changed in the nice treaty before we can even contemplate putting it before the people again the nice treaty is a complex document which intends to achieve complex things it was sold to the irish people as a means of providing for the enlargement of the european union last night mr prodi made it very clear that was not what the treaty is about he did not however make clear precisely what it is about he was saying therefore that the enlargement process could be achieved without the nice treaty i mentioned the assembly i attended yesterday and the considerable interest shown in the decision of the irish people some thought provoking contributors indicated that the opportunity afforded the irish people should also be offered to the citizens of other member states maybe then europe would get a clear message about what the people of europe expect in the coming years

8360216 expectations will be through the roof and the browns will need to get off to a good start to have a chance
8360217 their schedule is brutal and to win the afc north they will need to beat the steelers something they havent been very good at in recent decades
8360218 first the good news sean jones and brodney pool are two great young safeties and eric wright plays more like a grizzled veteran than a second year player bad news everybody else is hurt or at least it seems that way how well the duct tape keeps the secondary together could go a long way in determining how this season goes
8360219 along with the additions to the defensive line making an instant impact the browns need someone in the secondary to step up leigh bodden a starter in 2007 was traded to the detroit lions and daven holley is out for the season with a knee injury that means that last years no 2 eric wright will be pushed into the no 1 role while backup brandon mcdonald moves up to the starting spot vacated by wright this could be a recipe for disaster unless the duo elevates their game and the browns front seven generates a consistently effective pass rush
8360220 they just missed a division championship last year so its no stretch to think that with just a small amount of improvement on the defensive side these guys just might be the favorites in the afc north for the first time since re joining the league
8360221 what caf has advised is that in circumstances like ours they only give one extra week for the rescheduled match to be played

8360242 this is a union grievance about a violation of major league rules
8360243 the players association learned from several sources that the commissioners office had extended the deadline for negotiating and reporting signings with drafted players
8360244 the grievance was not filed on behalf of any particular player
8360245 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8360246 at the pirates request the office of the commissioner today placed pedro alvarez on major league baseballs restricted list
8360247 the major league rules provide that a player who refuses to sign a uniform player contract to which he has agreed and report to the signing club shall upon a report of the signing club be placed on the restricted list until he signs a contract reflecting the terms to which he has agreed
8360248 the pirates are confident that the contract reached with pedro alvarez was agreed to and submitted to major league baseball in a timely fashion and properly accepted by major league baseball
8360249 the pirates made several attempts to commence negotiations immediately following the draft and were willing and ready to agree to pay pedro a 6 million signing bonus from the very outset
8360250 the office of the commissioner has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary despite our disappointment we continue to believe in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system we will sit down with pedro and his family as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and much more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8360251 the major league baseball players association today filed a grievance challenging the unilateral decision of the commissioners office to extend the august 15 2008 signing deadline for drafted players
8360252 in the 2006 round of collective bargaining the players association agreed to establish an august 15 signing deadline for drafted players with remaining collegiate eligibility
8360253 within hours after this years august 15 midnight deadline passed the players association learned from several sources that the commissioners office had extended the deadline for negotiating and reporting signings with drafted players
8360254 i have read the statement issued by frank coonelly president of the pittsburgh pirates regarding pedro alvarez
8360255 moreover based on information gathered to date by the association franks statement is inaccurate in a number of respects while the association will not respond specifically through the press we are confident that at hearing the panel will agree that the commissioners office acted improperly when it unilaterally changed the terms of the deal it struck with the association in 2006
8360256 america stands at a crossroads with an historic choice between two paths for our country one is a path of renewing opportunity and promoting innovation here at home and of greater security and respect around the world it is the path that renews our democracy by bringing us together as one nation under god

8360434 that young democracy has been subjected to an unjustified assault
8360435 we are going to compete in that district no matter what but the lessons from the last election were that if youve got a incumbent being investigated by the fbi who has the ethical problems that don youngs got that presents a big opportunity

8360449 bernstein adopted mahlers persona for himself he became the avatar of mahler though others had championed him bernstein kept plugging away for mahlers music in the concert hall on the airwaves through recordings and through his lectures in this mission bernstein also had the help of the lp record and that was important because the length scale and architecture of mahlers music was hard to convey on 78 records that could only play four or five minutes of music at a time
8360450 alma was the guardian of mahlers reputation in many ways she met bernstein and did get together with the bernsteins in the bernsteins apartment at the dakota just the fact that they were in the same time and place and did know each other is quite extraordinary
8360451 this year marks the 50th anniversary of bernsteins appointment as music director of the new york philharmonic and the 90th anniversary of bernsteins birthday but bernstein is worth celebrating any old time
8360452 the winds are blowing the right way for leonard bernstein right now
8360453 the press used to criticize bernstein for that when he wrote for broadway he was slumming and conversely if he wrote for the concert hall he was being pretentious this view is passing works of bernsteins that were overlooked are now getting performances and holding up very nicely
8360454 the archives arent that dusty yet so theres a lot of information available bernstein himself provided so much information historians have to be very cautious about that because bernstein was aware that everything he did was being watched so he was pretty careful about getting across his story in the form he wanted but he was also very outspoken
8360455 bernstein was involved in so many aspects of our cultural life he was a composer conductor lecturer media personality a great celebrity host literary and artistic people were in his orbit he advocated for civil and human rights he threw a party in his home to raise money for the legal defense of the black panthers he lived at a really vibrant time of american history and was music director of the new york philharmonic during the 1960s the decade when the united states was going haywire and during this time he was at the center of the cultural world

8360493 i understand english is important for players to communicate with sponsors but you have to realize this is a professional sport these are athletes who are entertaining fans it should be based on performance everybody should be equal

8360551 this is consistent with our finding with newborn babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently

8360555 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8360556 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8360557 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8360558 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8360559 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8360560 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs

8360573 the federal governments current immigration program primarily benefits a small minority of wealthy and powerful americans at the expense of significant segments of the middle class and the poor attempts to protect the current level of immigration by wrapping it in the language of tradition or humanitarianism generally distort both history and the practical realities of our own era

8360705 philippa colins review shows young australians are anything but apathetic they are strongly engaged with political issues and social causes such as the environment poverty health and an australian republic
8360706 however they feel alienated and marginalised by old formal institutionalised politics
8360707 the review finds that for young people theres been a generational shift in australian politics the research shows its no longer about political loyalties its about political choice
8360708 young australians are distrustful of politicians and they are not content to accept the hierarchies in traditional institutions of democracy they prefer to engage in grassroots campaigns and cause based activities where they feel like they can make a difference
8360709 the underlying attitudes of young people are important for policy makers as they look to the future
8360710 more importantly young australians will be critical in shaping our democracy and our democratic institutions
8360711 civic education which has been the dominant policy response to dwindling rates of youth participation for some years is not the answer
8360712 the research shows that civic education programs and experiences where young people have little or no control over the process or outcomes can be counter productive
8360713 what weve seen from this literature review is that there are gaps in the research there are no specific studies on what young people would like democracy to look like there is little if any research assessing the impact of young peoples political activities

8360717 today is about expressing oneself freely and if we can raise awareness about a worthy cause like casual day being who we are then its all the better
8360718 the organisation is all about being casual and brightening up the lives of others is the icing on top of the cake
8360719 we know we are in a battle and i have every confidence in paul as has club chairman andy appleby and the three of us together are quite resolute in our belief it can be turned round it is very early in the season and i completely understand the disquiet and criticism coming our way because it is deserved but we will take it on the chin and get on with it
8360720 i do not know a chairman in the land who is incompetent enough to put a time scale on managers it has always been a media thing to do it would be unfair on everybody we are not underestimating the disquiet we know the supporters are extremely unhappy all i can say is that we are working as hard as we can to turn it round we are going to have to be big boys take the stick and sort it out we have always had full confidence in paul jewell and that has not changed in the slightest
8360721 we are not out of the woods but its a step in the right direction
8360722 i got asked about not winning a league game since september but the season only started in august
8360723 weve had three games and its all these players ever hear about is this run were on theyre only human beings and it plays on their minds weve got to try to rid people of that and the sooner we win a league game the monkey will be off our back its crumbs of comfort we are after its not even about getting to the third round of the cup its about trying to build a squad into believing that they can go on to win league games i feel as if we are a long way from where i want to be but at least weve shown some fight and some gumption i thought we deserved a victory because i dont think they caused us too many problems over 90 minutes

8360730 why has there not been any mention of the potentially adverse effects of mercks cervical cancer vaccination gardasil in relationship to the timing of the vaccination and where a young woman is in her menstrual cycle
8360731 are common during the premenstruum and may follow administration of antibiotics and inoculations confusion may occur as to the real origin of such reactions in double blind clinical trials the placebo drugs are often reported to have side effects such as increased drowsiness headache nausea or increased pain which may be no more than the usual premenstrual symptoms which have not been meticulously observed and reported
8360732 measles cases in the u s are at the highest level in more than a decade with nearly half of those involving children whose parents rejected vaccination health officials reported thursday worried doctors are troubled by the trend fueled by unfounded fears that vaccines may cause autism the number of cases is still small just 131 but thats only for the first seven months of the year there were only 42 cases for all of last year the cdcs review found that a number of cases involved home schooled children not required to get the vaccines others can avoid vaccination by seeking exemptions such as for religious reasons the vaccine is considered highly effective but not perfect 11 of this years cases had at least one dose of the vaccine of this years total 122 were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status some were unvaccinated because the children were under age 1 too young to get their first measles shot in 63 of those cases almost all of them 19 or under the patient or their parents refused the shots for philosophical or religious reasons the cdc reported in washington state an outbreak was traced to a church conference including 16 school aged children who were not vaccinated eleven of those kids were home schooled and not subject to vaccination rules in public schools its unclear why the parents rejected the vaccine the illinois outbreak triggered by a teenager who had traveled to italy included 25 home schooled children according to the cdc report
8360733 he was advanced for his age he was talking when he was 11 months old
8360734 it doesnt serve us well when we have government officials trying to create fear and anxiety
8360735 right now were seeing a one size fits all approach to vaccination that doesnt really recognize that children are different that children react differently to vaccinations
8360736 under most scenarios extending the catchup to 26 wasnt cost effective
8360737 we believe theres important value in vaccinating all women who are in the indicated age groups
8360738 is that policy based in ignorance arrogance or methodical design
8360739 are common during the premenstruum and may follow administration of antibiotics and inoculations confusion may occur as to the real origin of such reactions in double blind clinical trials the placebo drugs are often reported to have side effects such as increased drowsiness headache nausea or increased pain which may be no more than the usual premenstrual symptoms which have not been meticulously observed and reported
8360740 in those days we believed that the premenstrual syndrome was a rare condition but we know now that it is the worlds commonest and probably oldest disease

8360758 my whole background has really been in program development and taking on initiatives like service so i dont see myself taking on a significant policy role

8360772 im afraid that by the time january comes along the economy will be the most serious problem in america
8360773 the reasons why the price of oil has come down is because i spent 5 yrs in a communist prison cell i didnt have a car

8360775 accusing john mccain of being in the pocket of big oil has been a consistent line of attack from democrats in the past few months

8360782 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8360783 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8360784 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8360785 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8360786 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8360805 he knew when to crawl you can see the top of his hat in the picture and you could see where he didnt face the camera
8360806 the real crux of our system is highrise we use it in managing projects production post production and marketing we use it to stay organized we use it to manage our authorized retailer clients around the world and we couldnt breathe as well or sleep as well without it
8360807 our first task was to store documents that we use on to our important documents page traditionally these documents were stored on our company server but it was sometimes problematic accessing these via a vpn if we were working from home or abroad accessing them on the cloud via backpack has simplified this task and we are now working faster and with less hassle
8360808 i used the same idea to embed our camtasia videos into our tutorials project solves a huge issue for me since before i could only add a link to the video i have attached a image of how it looks it was a great help
8360809 2 now if you cant read your mail like any literate human being then you need to be shot down like the filthy wolves i pray for lots of deep tracking snow and good flying weather if the adfg needs to borrow my hammer to crush some puppy skulls give me a call
8360810 ohio state was a great host and it was an opportunity to increase our outreach to schools
8360811 heres a question that i decided to ask on this forum rather than taking 10 seconds to google the damn answer
8360812 if its not in my country i dont give a damn
8360813 we would have an immigration policy that brings 12 million people out of the shadows

8360821 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8360822 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8360823 we will not re start the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8360824 she was going to stay strong for her babies and she did
8360825 there was prayer lifted up for her all over this county in all the churches
8360826 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8360827 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8360828 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8360829 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8360830 he doesnt like being at the mercy of others he likes to be in control of what hes doing
8360831 i suspect that theres some pretty strong or in depth party polls that are riding by riding that are persuading him that his chances are pretty good right now
8360832 the motel room basically was set up for surgery to take place

8360834 we are announcing that a new franchise from rockstar games will be exclusive to ps3 as part of our long standing relationship with rockstar and the incredible success for both companies with the cultural icon that is grand theft auto weve agreed to the playstation exclusive rights of the next great franchise from the rockstar studios
8360835 rockstar really wanted to make a game that you can truly only do on ps3 harnessing the power of cell and blu ray disc and this deal lets them do just that
8360836 he had taken five or six steps back and then came running at me
8360837 he had the microphone which worried me for a split second
8360838 im not going to say im scared but it crossed my mind then he just jumped me
8360839 faster than you would like a grown man to come at you
8360840 and then he started gyrating his private area against me rather with some gusto and since my arms were locked i went like this and he went over my shoulder

8360847 in the u s each day five to ten people are severely injured and one to two killed by arc flash electrical explosions
8360848 because of the dangers of these electrical explosions osha now legally requires employers to follow the national fire prevention association nfpa recommended practices to protect workers from arc flash exposure
8360849 having a proper program in place to protect workers is beyond being the right thing to do now arc flash loss prevention is mandatory
8360850 the financial impact of an arc flash accident can be devastating and because the stakes are so high risk managers who typically do not have an engineering or technical background need to understand the exposure the methods needed to prevent these accidents and the costs associated with initiating an aflp program
8360851 an aflp program goes beyond engineering and risk identification offered by many firms today and fills the risk management gap by instilling processes to train track and update
8360852 because our clients are asking us what they need to meet osha and nfpa regulations we decided to write a white paper that would give executives and middle management the answers required to manage arc flash loss prevention
8360853 establishing an arc flash loss prevention program gives management the ability to put measures in place to hold their technical resources responsible for safety asset management and document control
8360854 the roll call is guided by the rules of the party
8360855 it will proceed just as the rules dictate every state and every delegate will have the opportunity to vote everyone will be represented everyone will have their votes counted

8360857 the biblical model is that men should be leaders in church
8360858 every team needs a leader and god has made it clear over and over in scripture that men are to lead
8360859 maybe men would return to church if there was something for them to do
8360860 i am involved at washburn because i get to do something and make decisions in these organizations
8360861 i know men do not know the god i know
8360862 if they did we would not be able to keep them out because connecting with god is the single most exciting thing on this earth
8360863 in the course of this investigation i received calls from several persons who know the defendant all claim she is a habitual liar and she has been known to steal from friends in the past

8360872 we bought extremely cheap manual treadmills off of amazon and decided to sense their speed with a mouse rather than trying to hook into the treadmills output with some sort of analog interface i wrote a quick script in glovepie to calculate the maximum speed my mouse could track its a nice mx revolution but i could only get it to track a little over 4mph if we were going to run at 12mph on the treadmill a mouse wouldnt be able to keep up we decided to use a bicycle tire pushed against the treadmill to reduce the speed the mouse would have to track eli used a 26

8360898 as suppliers continue to work towards overcoming supply and demand constraints changing market dynamics are forcing suppliers to change strategies to move towards offering more end to end services or hold their leadership positions
8360899 because few suppliers today have end to end s2p source to pay service capabilities they are making concerted efforts to round out their capabilities through acquisitions partnerships and internal enhancements
8360900 po suppliers are expanding their delivery footprint across onshore in region and offshore delivery locations
8360901 while sourcing focused suppliers are onshore centric and p2p focused suppliers tend to focus on offshore centric models end to end suppliers have developed a healthy mix of onshore in region and offshore ftes almost all po suppliers are beginning to optimize their location strategies as global sourcing starts to play an increasingly important role in the po market

8360953 oh we were wondering where you were we meet outside the gym
8360954 why the fuck didnt it occur to anyone that they should tell the rotc noob

8360956 they relax more easily and forget the things they do on a daily basis when you come in that door you leave everything behind you
8360957 i read about how good salt therapy is supposed to be
8360958 evolutionary speaking a lot of our bodies are salt water
8360959 to be in that environment physically feels right if youve ever gone swimming in the ocean you feel rejuvenated theres a balancing effect
8360960 when youre relaxed your stress hormones are better controlled and your immune system works better
8360961 we dont say we actually heal anybody because were not doctors its more of a relaxation place
8360962 its collapsing you need a chauffeur to drive me home
8360963 jesus is fake god is fake true love is never sin
8360964 but when i do they are beautiful beyond words the other day i was with someone and as she walked into the room her guardian angel opened up for me and i saw its golden wings in such detail i could see the feathers individually
8360965 those are the peoples guardian angels weve all got one they are usually about three paces behind us
8360966 and then im also seeing the other angels too the ones that i call the helpers and teachers they are white and beautiful all angels have a human appearance but thats just for us so we are not terrified
8360967 i know what im seeing whatever anyone thinks of it
8360968 to me seeing angels is quite natural its been happening for so long im only discovering now when people like you ask me questions about it that others dont find it natural
8360969 one patient a girl from sarajevo had suffered major damage after a grenade had been thrown into her home her body was literally peppered with shrapnel particularly the spinal area lorna without the use of x ray was not only able to point out where all the shrapnel pieces were but to indicate what the effect of each piece was on the girls body
8360970 people have called me all sorts of things in the past
8360971 i dont like psychic im not a psychic sometimes other people have said wheres the healer when they have come to find me but i dont heal thats not me thats god the angels carry the message helping me to intercede with god
8360972 im dys whats the word i still cant say it you know not good with words
8360973 no i was allowed to see his soul after he died on one occasion it was beautiful
8360974 from the moment angel elijah showed me a vision of joe i was always in love with him i was only maybe nine or 10 at the time but the connection was made
8360975 between spirit world and human world angels you see are not souls of people who have died as is sometimes said they are creatures another being a spiritual being so if you ask me the question of which world id find it easier to live in id have to say the spirit world
8360976 if i had told people what i was seeing when i was a child
8360977 they are frightened to acknowledge that part of themselves that has anything to do with god because they dont want to be thought of as mad too
8360978 the religions are putting angels out of the equation as much as possible in order to have control over human beings
8360979 and i mean all religions all churches i can see angels in churches in synagogues and mosques they are everywhere
8360980 the response from the website my book has given people back hope and belief in life itself and that for me is wonderful there are people who tell me they havent prayed for years since they left school but now its the hope the world is crying out for
8360981 this lawsuit is a poorly disguised attempt to deflect attention away from the primary cause of the decline of the sacramento san joaquin delta estuary
8360982 the truth is that the massive increase in the diversion of water in recent years has accelerated the crash of the delta fisheries although many factors such as pollution urban development and invasive species affect the delta excessive water diversion is the leading cause of the decline in the fisheries
8360983 delta smelt salmon and striped bass have successfully co existed in this ecosystem for more than a century there is no evidence that recent population declines of either delta smelt or chinook salmon resulted from predation by striped bass whose numbers have also collapsed
8360984 in contrast there is strong scientific evidence that dams water diversions pollution and the collapse of the planktonic food web in the upper estuary are harming all the fishes that rely on the bay delta
8360985 delta smelt and chinook salmon have shown continuous long term declines since the 1960s and 1970s when the state and federal water projects began exporting water and striped bass have shown the same decline
8360986 there has been no evidence of a classic predator prey relationship no reputable scientist has pinned the crash of smelt and salmon on the striped bass
8360987 although they claim to care about the ecological health of the delta the so called coalition for a sustainable delta is most interested in maintaining their historic allotment of taxpayer subsidized water exports their efforts to blame striped bass are ridiculous and a desperate move
8360988 we hope they will focus their attention on the real issues affecting the health of the delta compared to the alleged striped bass predation issue there are hundreds of more important issues affecting salmon and smelt in this once great estuary
8360989 im certain the endangered species act was never designed to decimate an important recreational asset like the west coast striped bass fishery and remove its status as a sport fish
8360990 yet thats exactly what will happen if the irrigators prevail in this lawsuit
8360991 i hate to think of all the tackle shop owners marinas and fishing guides that will be unnecessarily harmed if the coalition for a sustainable delta wins this suit
8360992 blaming striped bass for the decline of endangered bay delta fisheries is yet another devious plot of the water grabbers who comprise the coalition for a sustainable delta it is obvious the coalition considers the striped bass to be a roadblock for claiming more northern water
8360993 they should put their efforts toward addressing the real problems that have adversely affected delta smelt and chinook salmon if the coalition is successful in their greedy attack it will signal the end of a great fishery for many individuals and families and for many young and old anglers who love the thrill of catching a striped bass
8360994 to be and not to seem too bad you did not enjoy the true character of this great statesman and genteel person who worked hard to look out for your interests in the us senate

8361014 i think i was on the side of justice and ultimately it will be seen that way
8361015 i dont think our move was so much towards violence
8361016 i think that what we did was to look at this situation of 2 000 people a day being murdered in vietnam and try to figure out a couple of things
8361017 and so we said to ourselves what are we going to do and so we set about building a clandestine organization and the whole point was to survive them and then possibly to take the fight to them against the war and against against empire generally i think we were moving in a direction that said demonstrations you know weve tried to demonstrate weve tried to petition our government weve gone door to door and knocked on doors weve talked to our neighbors weve talked to you know our parents our republican parents and everybody agrees with us but we cant stop the war so what do we do
8361018 how can we expect our kids to compete on an equal playing field with kids at suburban schools
8361019 im going to say open these doors and put my kid on equal footing
8361020 but the fact that the amount of money spent on education is determined by where you live is fundamentally unfair
8361021 if we had a little bit of the resources of the districts five miles from us we could close the gap that much quicker
8361022 by most measures the performance of u s students has remained stubbornly flat in the face of resource or policy adjustments
8361023 telling them to go to another district and enroll sends the message that your teachers arent as good as those in the suburbs
8361024 i bring the same level of competence to my classroom as any other teacher
8361025 take the aaa sign in before you can post messages

8361030 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8361031 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8361032 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8361033 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8361034 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8361041 resulta lamentable desafortunado e inadmisible la justificaci n y el apoyo irresponsables que el ex presidente cubano fidel castro ruz diera al ejercicio de la violencia

8361051 i still have to go back for my three month check up to find out more but as of right now i can do more and start exercising a little bit
8361052 i usually dont do this but im going to break my rule this time theres been so much talk about my last blog entry that its amazing some of it is legitimate thinking some of it is just from idiots i never said the gsp fight was boring the reason i walked out was because i wanted to beat the crowd i didnt think fitch was going to get back in the match and the fight wasnt as exciting as i thought it would be if you want you can go look at my last blog entry and see that this is basically what i said so people criticized me for leaving the fight early and said that was disrespectful to gsp i disagree i just wanted to get out of there some people just need to realize that this is what i do for a living now lets take what you do for a living go to a conference every month for a few years and see if you want to leave early during one of them i even had one guy on yahoo sports report that i said that i thought gsp was on steroids if you go back to my blog and look at what i actually said i said that i thought that he looked smaller than he has looked before never once did i say that gsp was on steroids for this fight just goes to show that you cant trust some of the journalism for the sport out there

8361054 often inaccurate or out of date and it lacked analysis and focus
8361055 a document meant to educate the american public about health as a global challenge and urge them to action should at least let americans know what their generosity is already doing in helping to solve those challenges
8361056 sloppy work poor analysis and lack of scientific rigor did
8361057 we cannot overstate that problems in remote parts of the globe can no longer be ignored diseases that americans once read about as affecting people in regions most of us would never visit are now capable of reaching us directly the hunger disease and death resulting from poor food and nutrition create social and political instability and that instability may spread to other nations as people migrate to survive

8361099 campaign spending in the 2007 elections a challenge to 2010 elections
8361100 what is alarming is that no one violated airtime limits and no one overspent in the last elections if based on the legislators reports to the commission on elections comelec
8361101 the purpose of monitoring campaign finance is not merely to establish if campaign spending limits are being violated but more importantly to determine whether or not there exists a level playing field in the electoral contest
8361102 further although beyond the scope of this report understanding funding for campaigns is also critical in determining the relationships between the funders of the campaign and the political behavior of candidates
8361103 when we did compare 2007 and 2004 spending we found that 2007 spending was two and half times larger than spending in 2004 for all media for all candidates
8361104 we did not sort out exactly the sources but what we did look at what was the amount spent on political ads and how they used the money on political ads
8361105 because the project in 2007 was a pilot project we looked only on the expenditure side we didnt look at the funding side we hope in 2010 when we expand the monitoring we will include sources of funds but unfortunately for 2007 we dont have any data on the sources of funding

8361108 i cannot give allegiance to your government since im not sure if you are legally legitimate members of the united states or a sovereign state or stateless or even legally dead i am allowed to do the following
8361109 first my orders from the group were to establish protect and help develop a human colony on tau ceti d which would be an independent state pending recognition by the group governments
8361110 second my orders do not mention negative matter but it may be considered a potential weapon of mass destruction
8361111 third as a senior officer of the united states armed forces i promote all current cadets serving on tau ceti d to active service with all the rights and obligations that those entail with the exception of officers pay oaths will be administered by dr william chamer as he has demonstrated the qualifications for the office all members of the us military present on tau will follow the two orders given above or resign both their commissions and their cadet service
8361112 that is all on the record lieutenant off the record they are right to keep the knowledge secret i wouldnt transmit it even if the examiners give us their blessing its too dangerous
8361113 that this will work theres no need to worry because it will work i know what i want and where my heart is my aunt called me last night to check up on us lol she has never done that before she kept on saying over and over again

8361118 she was doing quite well but over time she developed this degenerative arthritis problem in the ac joint
8361119 we basically remove the area of arthritis and create a space so she is no longer pinched off by the spurs
8361120 theres immediate relief after the surgery and recovery is quite quick
8361121 the goal would be by six weeks to be back to full activity
8361122 this is a great way of relieving her discomfort and allowing her to resume the activity shed like to in a pain free way

8361133 this is the benefit i hear most from cloud providers
8361134 also for space reasons im purposely not including the flip side to these benefits however if you read this blog regularly you should recognise some
8361135 i get that the whole point of the spear carrier is that they are seen as expendable and die when they dont deserve to but have you considered what that means for the examiners
8361136 if you want to know what the examiners think about us why dont you ask them
8361137 i dont think they see us as spear carriers or red shirts if they do they dont act like it if they did they could have just snuffed out the four
8361138 thats my point they claimed to see us as potential equals but i think even dad has been treating them as some analogy of the spear carrier they arent people to us we treat them like objects and abstract fitness tests i dont like it
8361139 there really isnt any other way would you feel better if wed started to treat them like gods theyll become people when we can see them if you have faith that the test will actually end
8361140 but people should have bodies so are they computers brains in vats green goo what does an examiner look like
8361141 i think if i make a close pass over the dam i can drop the line and have it reach you i cant make a tight enough circle for you to work a harness on the end want to try for a straight grab
8361142 its a lot safer but a lot more noisy help me with these rocks well you
8361143 we tie the rocks to this light the wick and toss it into the lake the current will drag it downstream and we get as far upstream was we possibly can before the tank blows it should have lodged in the outlet by then that should take down the dam and then we just walk out nothing crazy like hanging from a forty meter rope
8361144 we could have died out there and you ask me and your daughter to take an insane risk to get out of there dont give me something about the dam not bursting i worked it out even if the mine didnt take it out by itself it would have either blocked the channel and the pressure would have broken it down or widened it drained the lake it would have worked just fine instead we had to play hero i thought survival came first
8361145 maybe the examiners made us more willing to accept these sorts of life and death truths than we would have been otherwise our entire lives have been the test for so long that we dont think about it much anymore now you have begun to understand this is the sort of thing that we cant teach you without your reaching the edge first a lot of wisdom is like that it either comes from very thorough study or sudden pain that is life

8361158 for at forst det m man spole filmen lidt tilbage i 2006 fik vi nogle ordentlige tryk det gjorde at vi iv rksatte nogle nye og meget skrappe procedurer for risikostyring og accept af opgaver s den portef lje vi arbejder med i dag er meget sund og det afspejler sig i vores resultater
8361159 vores filosofi er at vi kun tager de projekter vi synes vi kan gennemf re med et ordentligt resultat til f lge b de for os og for kunden s tager vi den konsekvens det har for toplinjen s vi jager ikke oms tning for enhver pris det kr ver disciplin og den mener jeg vi har f et indf rt det kan man ogs se i resultaterne
8361160 jeg vil ikke sige at det har v ret positivt for os det er aldrig positivt at f de ret ver vi fik dengang men det gav anledning til at vi sk rpede fokus p de n vnte ting og det er i sig selv positivt men at sige t vene var gode for os kan jeg ikke f mig selv til at sige
8361161 vi kan selvf lgelig m rke afmatningen og det kan man ogs se p vores oms tning vi kan s til dels kompensere det med get aktivitet p andre omr der
8361162 selvom det er g et h rdt for sig er der stadig et h jt aktivitetsniveau i danmark det skal man huske vi har en fornuftig likviditet og har ingen renterisiko samtidig har vi ingen projekter som vi ikke har f et solgt og som st r og tr kker renter jeg tror vi har to projekter i eget regi og m ske 40 lejligheder vi ikke har f et solgt s det ndrer ikke noget

8361165 stanley would like you to send him a radio documentary you made called hotel auschwitz
8361166 is that kubrick is a hoarder there is an extensive archive of material at his home in childwick bury when that is eventually opened we may get close to understanding the tangled brain which brought to life hal the clockwork orange droogs and jack torrance
8361167 you have that office outside my office if i need you
8361168 all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
8361169 most people attributed the purchase of childwick to kubricks passion for privacy and drew parallels with jack torrance in the shining
8361170 is a cabinet full of 25 000 library cards three inches by five inches if you want to know what napoleon or josephine or anyone within napoleons inner circle was doing on the afternoon of july 23 17 whatever you go to that card and itll tell you
8361171 did you do this kind of massive research for all the movies
8361172 i understand how you might do this for napoleon but what about say the shining
8361173 is just about every ghost book ever written and therell be a box containing photographs of the exteriors of maybe every mountain hotel in the world
8361174 dear pat although you are apparently too busy to personally return my phone calls perhaps you will find time in the near future to reply to this letter
8361175 before you send an angry letter imagine how it would look if it got into the hands of time out
8361176 and it will make it appear that the material in dr strangelove is stock footage i feel this harms the film
8361177 that space 1999 may very well become a long running and important television series there seems nothing left now but to seek the highest possible damages the deliberate choice of a date only two years away from 2001 is not accidental and harms us
8361178 received additional material is there any material with humour or zaniness that you could send
8361179 the style of the picture is reflected by the stills you have already received the film is based on william makepeace thackerays novel which though it has irony and wit could not be well described as zany
8361180 please put all mail in the white box under the colonnade across the courtyard to your right
8361181 it was stanleys favourite typeface its sans serif he liked helvetica and univers too clean and elegant
8361182 is this the kind of thing you and kubrick used to discuss
8361183 sometimes late into the night i was always trying to persuade him to turn away from them but he was wedded to his sans serifs
8361184 i did once get him to admit the beauty of bembo
8361185 so is that note to the postman a sort of private tribute from you to kubrick
8361186 thats like saying had vermeer painted in a different manner hed have done 100 more paintings
8361187 but if he hadnt allowed his tireless work ethic to take him to unproductive places hed have made more films
8361188 for instance the space 1999 lawsuit seems with the benefit of hindsight a little trivial
8361189 i know i have the talent to be a big star i know its going to happen to me one day i just need a break will you give me that break
8361190 youre not going to make it its best you know now rather than face years of having your dreams slowly erode
8361191 he never never responded it would have been too much it would have driven him crazy he didnt like to get engaged with strangers
8361192 your letter of 4th may was overwhelming what can i say in reply sincerely stanley kubrick
8361193 i was in the kitchen with stanley and i mentioned that id just been to the opticians in st albans to get a new pair of glasses
8361194 but even if he didnt reply to the fan letters
8361195 what is the meaning behind the epidemic does the pink furniture reveal anything about the 3rd monolith and its emitting a pink colour when it first approaches the ship does this have anything to do with a shy expression does the alcohol offered by the russians have anything to do with french kissing and saliva
8361196 why do you think arthur c clarke marked that particular paragraph for kubrick to read
8361197 its the head of the sniper from full metal jacket
8361198 one time a package arrived with 100 bottles of brown ink i said to stanley what are you going to do with all that ink he said i was told they were going to discontinue the line so i bought all the remaining bottles in existence stanley had a tremendous amount of ink
8361199 was finding a daisy gun that he had when he was a child
8361200 can you run me over to oxford with my dog

8361202 theres been so much killing friend against friend neighbour against neighbour but we all know nobody on this earth is to blame mrs brighton weve all had the compulsions well just have to forgive each other our trespasses ill do my part ill grant a general amnesty wipe the slate clean then perhaps we can begin to live again as ordinary decent human beings and forget the horror of the past few months
8361203 john has got to have very powerful connections of the highest level
8361204 we opened them up and found a note written by someone at g ryder amp co
8361205 as opposed to non fussy customers who dont care if they struggle all day to get the tops off

8361207 contact will be broadened do you want me to save you
8361208 hunter biden met with the obama senate office not with senator obama
8361209 its hardly surprising that a senator from illinois would fight for investments in mercy hospital thorek hospital and st xavier university right in illinois or that hed be joined in that effort by a republican colleague representative judy biggert
8361210 working with a number of clients institutions like yours and we would like to help you identify earmarks federal support and grants
8361211 to meet the demand in the southwest chicago metropolita area
8361212 two years ago we graduated more african american and hispanic nurses than any private college in the state of illinois
8361213 im not at all apologetic that we asked for federal support for huge health care needs of this growing community
8361214 he was a crucial supporter of the law in that he paved the way for other democrats to support it
8361215 senator biden provided a lot of political cover for the credit card industry because they wanted to show that the proposal had bipartisan support he aggressively undermined the opposition to the bill
8361216 hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
8361217 he was never a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
8361218 he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8361219 while barack obama decries washington insiders and says that he detests lobbyists joe biden is the model washington insider with numerous connections to lobbyists and special interests
8361220 as strong a supporter of ethics reform as the senate has ever known and his office follows all ethics laws right down to the letter
8361221 lower salaries for young lawyers at some point in the foreseeable future
8361222 the software is started right away and waits for commands about virtually anything from sending spam capturing passwords banking details it can do pretty much anything
8361223 its tragic that its probably microsofts most profiled site in norway that spread this

8361225 call for participants new media international trends concepts and case studies tbilisi georgia
8361226 im focused on this election i am going full time for senator obama
8361227 but i never rule anything out everyday is a new opportunity i would like to be pope if i could
8361228 suppose for example youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom would you vote
8361229 so in this election we face a choice we can continue down the path weve been traveling or we can choose another future this is the opportunity we must seize and this may be our last chance to seize it

8361232 right of parents to have the aid of the government in protecting children
8361233 weve seen similar proposals in the past that havent gone very far and this proposal seems quite similar to that older proposal except presented by a law professor in a law review rather than a local business man
8361234 right of parents to have the aid of the government in protecting children
8361235 the court has issued an order asking the six defendants to stop protesting in government house and the area around the order takes effect immediately
8361236 we have discussed this and it is necessary that we have to defy the order
8361237 we have to fight so that our mission will be complete we would like to ask the mercy from the court to let us do our mission to restore the nation
8361238 we have to talk the senior police will talk about what to do next

8361278 i saw millions of people across the country working as one to elect the next democratic president
8361279 the russian president informed his chinese colleague about the situation in south ossetia and abkhazia

8361322 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8361323 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8361324 port fourchon plays a supporting role in providing approximately 18 percent of all domestic oil and gas and 13 percent of imports
8361325 take a look at the picture of the main road
8361326 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8361327 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8361328 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8361329 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8361330 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8361331 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8361332 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8361333 the purchase back of something that had been lost by the payment of a ransom
8361334 no theyre all mine i did every one of those things i cant lie anymore whats the use the only good thing i ever did was to pray last week for jesus to come into my heart and forgive my sins i went into a coma immediately after that i guess he didnt hear me
8361335 i heard him i forgave him he is mine father
8361336 my blood was enough you are free indeed you my son are redeemed i paid the price for you

8361340 thats a kind of immortality thats kind of scary when you think about it
8361341 kind of a coercive measure and i think its not appropriate for government to do that
8361342 i think it should be the people that make choices about environment

8361347 this is a real effort to create partnerships with groups that normally may not work together
8361348 in a way thats symbolic of the political coalitions that barack obama has brought together too
8361349 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8361350 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8361351 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8361352 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8361353 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8361354 each bid you place enters you into a binding contract all bids are active until the auction ends you win the auction as the winner you are obligated to buy the item for the winning bid price
8361355 sellers can file an unpaid item dispute with ebay for each of their items that are purchased but not paid for ebay will issue a strike on the account of the buyer who does not honor their obligation to pay unless the buyer and seller mutually agree not to complete the transaction
8361356 i havent spent the last 35 years insert achievements that she did that barack didnt here
8361357 i didnt spend the past 35 years and you havent worked so hard over the past eighteen months to see another republican in the white house and suffer through failed leadership
8361358 well gee i know it isnt me and now barack is going to lose see another republican in the white house
8361359 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president

8361364 we have to maintain the social security system in this country
8361365 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8361366 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8361367 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8361368 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8361369 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8361370 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8361371 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8361372 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8361373 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8361374 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8361375 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8361376 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates

8361382 im pretty disappointed by the way the college dems have been treated considering the supposed importance of the youth vote this year
8361383 her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8361384 e mi perdo cosi tra la pioggia e le nuvole

8361405 government informants sell information on open or unsolved cases to prison inmates sometimes prosecutors and federal agents feed the information directly the inmate memorizes the case which gives him the appearance of having inside knowledge the inmate then comes forward claiming information to trade in exchange for a reduced sentence which under the guidelines can only be granted at a prosecutors request the inmate then works with the prosecutor to finger someone it might be another inmate or a person on the outside the inmate coached by the prosecutors weaves a story to connect the person with the crime sometimes the prosecutor supplies the names of the persons that he wants fingered by fabricated testimony

8361463 your in love dumbass go ask her out to the dance you guys would look like a good couple
8361464 knows something but doesnt want to say it becuase it would rip the family apart
8361465 i told him that i would not go to the session becuase his mom would be there i do owe her an apology and thats it she has no right to sit in

8361468 its not just a balcony its much larger than most city back yards
8361469 the challenge of the 21st century is to meet the growing need for energy in ways that are not only profitable but sustainable
8361470 it was never our intention to be misleading in our advertisement
8361471 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
8361472 we have a responsibility in saskatchewan to stop this before we add more problems to the problem of climate change
8361473 this is a very sad day for me especially as a youth for this day really for me signifies the beginning of no return
8361474 this has the potential to be a very large type of development but we are working to ensure its being done in a responsible fashion
8361475 the environmental footprint will be very very modest in comparison to what many people think of as traditional oilsands developments
8361476 if you went down to the estevan weyburn area and looked at a conventional well it would be very similar to what you would see in the northwest in a type of oilsands development there
8361477 most tar sands will still need water will still need energy
8361478 i dont how much different it will be i think we need to have again a full assessment of that well before we actually go ahead and make a decision on going ahead with it
8361479 i once had the degree of my deviated septum operated on since then i can breathe much better and sleep nights like a baby the rest of my body is all mine and absolutely natural and its going to stay that way i am very satisfied with what god gave me
8361480 no ones surprised at sas strong finish this year across multiple categories including its outright win in business intelligence
8361481 its depth and breadth is legendary but its sas commitment to innovation that really seems to have the most lasting impact on the marketplace

8361484 it was all the way to the door when i got in my back was touching the door
8361485 i thought it would be fun like you see on tv but it aint like that
8361486 he just needs to get back to his family and hell come back when he can
8361487 it was more than we should have expected as far as command
8361488 its hard to believe he could have been that sharp with that much time missed
8361489 it wasnt fantastic but its something i can build on for sure and im glad to be back out here which is the main thing
8361490 theyre in better shape they we are but ive also said that this series in august isnt going to determine who plays in october
8361491 i think playing in this environment this atmosphere against these guys and the cubs we enjoy these games
8361492 if i can go out there and have nothing and get away with five innings and the bullpen does what they do and we get a win
8361493 there are no words to describe how badly i played
8361494 i cant get into atp events so i may have to just play lower level challengers
8361495 i have to try and get my game together but i dont know if its me the coaching or what
8361496 this match looked like i was crushed but it wasnt quite like that im struggling and i dont know how to get out of it right now
8361497 were talking about products that are cooked we could try to sterilize everything that we serve to everybody but nobody would want to eat it
8361498 well have to relook at that and the question of deli meats to see if we need to go further in terms of controlling those kind of products in health care facilities
8361499 we dont think we have any cases related to this particular outbreak which is not surprising since vancouver coastal hospitals didnt serve any of the contaminated products that were initially identified
8361500 some of the larger expanded recall products had been distributed but were not so concerned about that
8361501 this trip took place last thursday and she has gone to the united states on a personal visit
8361502 these are all rumours and her trip proves these rumours wrong
8361503 unlike last month when the peso was tracking oil price movements its now taking its cue from the us dollar but if the us dollar moves sideways for the next few days then the market will probably look again at the correlation with oil
8361504 today is a very happy day for me in the last month and a half a lot of things have happened around me and in my head i am proud of what i have done because i didnt know how i was going to react
8361505 id take milicics sister if it meant we could get rid of randolph
8361506 no one could go on site to tour the plant unless they went through us and we are not aware of any tour on monday that being said we are in the business of trying to find the best use of the site for the community and ford we receive lots of inquiries on idle sites such as this while it is true that some time ago we received a call from warner bros looking to lease some space on a short time basis it was not a proposition that made sense to us were not in discussion at this time
8361507 this is nothing new i know it would be a good story for warner bros to move into the area but all we did was check out the plant
8361508 the filmmakers typically look for different sites but michigan has become a desirable area because of the good incentives the legislation provides
8361509 when the legislation was first being introduced we sent information to the michigan film office
8361510 weve marketed ourselves as a city conducive to films like
8361511 it would make sense for movie companies such as warner bros to settle here southwest oakland county is a jewel we have all the necessary skilled tradesmen looking for opportunity to work with the i 96 interchange nearing completion and access to film making environs like milford with their horse farms and conversely those urbanesque areas we have everything to offer
8361512 the michigan film office was not involved in what was reported of warner bros looking at the ford wixom plant there are studios and those building infrastructures who are interested due to the legislation introduced by gov granholm but we were not in the loop on this one
8361513 its entirely possible warner bros went for a second drive by look since they are in town shooting a clint eastwood film but no one contacted us directly
8361514 minhas flores morreram eu as trazia com tanto cuidado mesmo em minhas m os elas morreram cada uma delas cuidadas como se fossem a ultima tanto cuidado foi em v o e elas morreram com calor do nosso inferno assim como o frio de nosso inverno tamb m o faria
8361515 id better get back they must be wondering where i went
8361516 we have never neglected our core gamers we still have developers working on popular core gaming franchises but we need longer to complete these games approximately two to three years
8361517 2010 and 2011 like most other places stated with assurance why is it considered so cool to be bashing nintendo these days are people that threatened by success nintendo cant do any step in any direction without being attacked by everyone media gamers and whatever
8361518 i felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldnt screw to save its species
8361519 during a second screening process a small amount of what was believed to be heroin and cocaine was discovered on her person
8361520 she is being booked at pacific division and then transferred to van nuys
8361521 if it is an unusual name they will be teased
8361522 chopping shredding mixing even grating are easy to do with a food processor
8361523 you can also do all of this by hand but it will take a lot longer and you will tire out your hands wrists and knives
8361524 however i do love the cuisinart 20 cup version for big jobs such as making a large amount of gazpacho
8361525 be sure and get the extra attachments including the small bowl which is perfect for small batches of shallots nuts onions etc you will want the slicing disc and the grating disk as well
8361526 over the years using your machine for heavy doughs and processing for a long time as well as grating a lot of cheese will shorten its life expectancy
8361527 also placing your bowl and attachments in the dishwasher is generally not recommended and finally dont put extremely hot liquids into the food processor it always makes a mess and seems to not contribute to the health of your machine
8361528 to actually go onto the oilsands sites themselves thats a new thing and i think we can expect to see more of that in the future as greater awareness is brought to whats going on up north
8361529 i think its of absolute importance to take the struggle of the tarsands right to the belly of the beast
8361530 its a largely symbolic gesture but were here to say that the tarsands are a disaster on a scale we havent seen before
8361531 our biggest reaction is to focus on the fact that the protesters did put themselves at a risk to their safety
8361532 the syncrude site is a large industrial and complex site and for people who are unfamiliar with the area there can be a safety risk so were thankful no one got hurt
8361533 we ll be delivering bottles of polluted athabasca river water to ceos and politicians
8361534 i really believe in living your beliefs and this is a really interesting opportunity to do that
8361535 even in some of the northern communities where a lot of the population is depending on the oil industry we found that a lot of people were inviting us into their homes and wanted to talk about what we wanted to talk about
8361536 i m from edmonton but i ve never seen the tarsands
8361537 for me that will be very important in itself to sort of understand the wider context
8361538 ideally no one would have to go on these kinds of urgent protests
8361539 as long as the tarsands are here there will be people speaking out against them
8361540 friendship is a plant of slow growth and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation
8361541 an evil secret society that has discovered the existence of very rare girls that carry a special blood trait
8361542 i have something i need to tell you and i just ask that you please listen to all im about to say before responding x years ago i discovered i had genital herpes ive gotten treated am taking repressive drug therapy and i havent had any outbreaks since y but herpes is caused by a virus which means i may always have it what that means for you is if we have sex there is a possibility you will get the virus too even though we would use a condom because condoms dont offer total protection against herpes if you did get the virus that doesnt mean you would necessarily get symptoms since many people who get the virus never have any symptoms in fact you could already have the virus and not know it more than one in five americans is infected with herpes less than a third of whom know it because they never have outbreaks if you want to do some research on it and learn more i can suggest some websites if you never want to see me again i understand but i hope you can at least respect the fact that i was honest with you
8361543 you wouldnt buy a toy without also bringing home the batteries the same goes for best in class service when firing up a new phone computer or hd television
8361544 our goal is to work with hhgregg to help customers experience instant gratification knowing theyll be live with comcast when they set up their new electronic equipment at home this is another example of our continuous effort to make our products available at americas best retail locations giving our customers what they want when its most convenient for them
8361545 i would have a very different opinion of tivo if its primary goal was to sell set top boxes
8361546 if that was their strategy id be quite negative but the company has been shifting its business strategy and we think theres enough runway left for them to start penetrating cable operators
8361547 i think the view is now with or without tivo people are going to watch television very differently and were focused on creating the right tools and the right business model so as these consumption changes occur there is a way for the industry to adopt to this and we avoid the issues that the newspaper industry now finds itself going through or the music business has gone through thats going to take a lot of work because while we see the industry beginning to understand that the speed with which this is attacked has an awful lot to do with the ability of the video business to avoid major dislocation
8361548 its clearly not good for the business but its not detrimental
8361549 it could turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of wanna be material girls
8361550 we have no evidence yet that madonna knows anything about this
8361551 ho ammazzato io il marito di vera ho fatto in modo che arrivasse alex mi togliesse la pistola ma in realta lo volevo uccidere io ci siamo conosciuti mesi fa mi aveva fatto delle avances ma io non volevo cosi lui e venuto da me ha cercato di rapire la mia bambina e
8361552 sai che cosa ti succede se firmi la tua confessione
8361553 va bene laura vuoi essere trattata peggio di una criminale eccoti accontentata
8361554 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8361555 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8361556 winston peters would be unacceptable as a minister in a government led by me unless he can provide a credible explanation
8361557 theres a conflict of evidence im not in a position to adjudicate that i think we need to see the privileges committee work through the issue
8361558 ultimately there is the possibility of expulsion short of that there is admonition suspension but plainly its very difficult for the prime minister to retain him as a minister when the house itself has decided the house had been misled
8361559 thats not that flash but it is a bounce back from the first six months of this year
8361560 fantastic an outstanding and unique service not just for those who follow turkey closely but those who follow international trends and ideas selection of material is some of the best anywhere coverage of the turkish press and turkish issues is truly unsurpassed outstanding and intelligent service

8361563 some rules to the prosperity of the plant and love
8361564 by violent attacks i refer to unprovoked assaults fighting and the like
8361565 this often results in real harm to members of the public
8361566 i am really proud of the position and its good to work with a private foundation like that
8361567 its sad that the money raised was through someones funeral but it has raised the awareness among the community and young women its a really good legacy to carry on with
8361568 in recognition of this and in memory of belinda the two positions will be known as the emmett mcgrath breast care nurses
8361569 they will support the patient and their family at each stage of the journey from diagnosis and surgery through to completion of treatment
8361570 i want you to go to the window open it stick your head out and yell im as mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore

8361575 the act prevents food eaten with a fork and knife but what about a spoon
8361576 if were in nato we wont have to worry about nato attacking romania over our relations with our hungarian minority the way you attacked yugoslavia
8361577 since turkey has been in nato for decades you let them do what they want with the kurdish minority
8361578 if thats why you want to get into nato ill make sure you never do
8361579 whats that guy so upset about he looks the way i felt when i chaired my last judiciary committee meeting

8361596 pawel is a real fighter who wanted to get right back into the ring after his first loss
8361597 hes one of the most explosive punchers around and has a very enthusiastic fan base everybody gets their moneys worth at a pawel wolak fight we also have some of the most popular entertaining fighters from the long island area on this card
8361598 gt iaea will be on hand to share information on its efforts in the area of water particularly the use of isotope hydrology a nuclear technique that helps experts to identify the size origin flow and age of a particular water source which can help planners to better manage their water resources
8361599 water is probably the most pressing issue in development today
8361600 the agencys work in using isotope hydrology to assist countries to manage their water resources is of particular relevance in this regard we work very closely both with our member states and with other agencies in the un water group to ensure that nuclear technology is part of any countrys strategic planning in the area of water
8361601 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition

8361603 it was an honor to receive this last year and it remains an honor to accept this this year
8361604 we will see 21 films and i hope and i have a lot of confidence in marco that we will see 21 films that will give us the state of art of what is cinema today
8361605 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8361606 it could have been a dog movie or an outer space movie we just kind of landed on a spy movie
8361607 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8361608 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8361609 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8361610 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8361611 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first
8361612 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated

8361619 a further check of the driver and vehicle disclosed 1 2 ounces of crack cocaine and 1 400 in cash
8361620 looking back at the custom bike world it was such a contrast it was almost nauseating so experiencing the performance world made me want to build a bike that could balance both worlds
8361621 about two years ago i planned this machine and built it to do things its like late 50s early 60s sort of caf racer crossed with modern custom sports bike but with modern techno harley and a lot of high tech thrown in this simple little sketch that i made on an airplane it was a bike that had a look to it it was also a look that no one had really delved into before
8361622 it runs just a front cylinder and where the cylinder of the v sits i run the supercharger harleys themselves are fun to work with but to take half of one was even a bigger challenge theres something fun in making a machine go fast that really is not supposed to i figured it would either be a grenade or wed get it to work quite well
8361623 we barely start with any factory parts at all its building a bike from a clean sheet of paper on this motorcycle everything from the kickstand to the frame all the body is all hand made the wheels are specially made the hubs for instance i started with 96 pounds of aluminum material and manually machined it down to an 18 pound hub i mean youre building everything
8361624 the industry has had a lot of negative exposure most notably the show orange county not to slam them they do their thing and they have their place but they will never really be considered bike builders its entertainment its an alternative to watching temptation island its not about bike building its not about informing or educating or showing people how things are done its about silly drama thats a whole different thing and we dont like to be associated with that in any way
8361625 part of it is i didnt really push it because thats not how i roll i always sort of had this idea that this is my work and if you like it great if people pick up on it thats awesome and if not thats fine too i let my work speak for itself and thats worked for me im really not the self promotion kinda guy
8361626 im looking at buying a few and putting them in our cars i think it would be advantageous for our members as investigators
8361627 it will make not only the person being stopped but also our members more accountable for their actions
8361628 we actually have many very innovative ideas in kelowna and are leading edge in many ways that is somewhat pleasing because people are continually picking my brain about what were doing because word has spread that weve had some success especially in the downtown core
8361629 the fact is that a very small percentage of people are responsible for over 50 of the crime probably five per cent of the people account for committing 50 of the crime we have to find some legislation to deal with keeping prolific offenders behind bars
8361630 were all struggling trying to find members to become police officers its getting to a critical stage that people dont want to join police organizations anymore
8361631 the election office is now up an running out of the city clerks division and were here to answer any questions potential candidates or electors may have
8361632 during the next two years the province will continue to work with local elected officials and first nations to ensure any new information about the potential impact sales may have on water quality and the ability to expand the reservoirs is reviewed
8361633 i would have preferred they said it was over and done with but theyve agreed to back off now we all have a chance to say no
8361634 the way it is today the impact on reservoir lakes is low theres no year round residency and we have to protect those watersheds so there was concern that the government would be reselling the lots and development would take place
8361635 its very good news weve always said that its not just a matter of water quality but also quantity we do need the storage studies and im certainly pleased to see that they are not making any moves until we get more information to them
8361636 taking part in something like is something ive wanted to do for a long time but i had to wait until i had the time to devote my full attention to it i decided this year was the best chance id get
8361637 i struggled with body image while in high school i really feel into the trap of wanting to be super skinny it weighs on you and it weighs on everyone at some point i know what its like to have a good day be dependant on getting a smile from the boy you like and if that doesnt happen having it turn things upside down
8361638 i want to tell them to not hold back on doing something just because they are afraid they might fail failing is not the worst thing that could happen i was very afraid to get on the stage and answer questions but i did it and im glad that i did even if i hadnt been crowned i still have the knowledge that i tried
8361639 after the process to be selected miss kelowna was over the road to miss canada was nine days long we were watched by the judges every step of the way because someones true personality comes out after spending more than a week travelling around in a small bus the judges had a hard task because any of us woman would have been a good choice
8361640 unfortunately my family wasnt able to travel to ontario to watch the final selection actually a lot of us didnt have any family there to witness the event because it was just too expensive for them to travel so we cheered each other on when i made the top three the other girls prayed for me because they knew that was really important to me
8361641 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8361642 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8361643 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8361644 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8361645 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8361646 normally when people come on a dig they will find something
8361647 weve got a tooth from a shark more mosasaur bones fish bones at least two different species of fish plesiosaur bones as well as some bird bones

8361651 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8361652 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk

8361655 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8361656 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8361660 it is difficult to see how the executive can demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal or even that a serious legal question is presented
8361661 simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue

8361667 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8361668 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8361669 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8361670 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8361671 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8361672 our hope is that they will have less traffic jam effect while having stronger electron pairing
8361673 the weight of spacecraft is a key factor in the overall cost of any space mission if we can identify better lighter and more efficient materials and the best ways of using them it may have a huge impact on the space programme

8361683 i want to thank defenders of wildlife action fund supporters for their help in this hard fought campaign
8361684 we faced an approximately 750 000 campaign from our opponents including safari club international and a 400 000 state funded campaign approved by governor sarah palin and the alaska legislature
8361685 but thanks to the generous support of defenders of wildlife action fund activists and donors we were able to reach thousands of voters yesterday over 75 000 alaskans voted to end this barbaric practice
8361686 despite this loss were not giving up alaskans for wildlife will continue to hold the state board of games feet to the fire and redouble our efforts to end this brutal program

8361701 i made it very clear to senator mccain when i spoke to him yesterday and i made it very clear to his people that i am honored to be asked to speak at the convention the republican convention and that i would be honored to do anything to help him win the presidency but that the state of california and the budget is the most important thing
8361702 so that if i dont have a budget i cannot speak at the convention
8361703 im here im not going anywhere i dont leave the state and i told them im not leaving the state until the budget is done

8361727 i found a camera 2 months ago which i handed in to the police its not been claimed so theyve now given it to me its a nice camera and i certainly dont mind keeping it but i as the photos include a stag night and then some european travel i thought they might be somebodies honeymoon photos
8361728 is it ok if i pass a photo onto some friends i was brought up in aberdeen and by the looks of it they live in the west end of aberdeen a bit older than me but perhaps someones older brother or sister might know
8361729 like sharkey i recognised the rubislaw quarry and on friday drove past it to confirm drove around for a wee while just on the off chance and at one time was only one street away from forest ave thats just like the thing
8361730 i was out all day and drove down the street in number 008
8361731 success thanks everyone i have now spoken to the owner of the camera despite constant teasing from family which made me more determined the camera and contents is to be reunited with its owner
8361732 hello everyone im the guy who lost the camera irenicdonna your efforts are truly amazing i dont know if there are many or enough people in the world who would do what youve done i cant thank you enough my wife and i do indeed live in aberdeen with our wee dog moe the pictures are from trips to rome and brussels my little sisters wedding and lastly a hillwalking trip with friends through the highlands isle of skye and glencoe we didnt know the camera was lost until it was too late to retrace our steps

8361745 just because were stuck in a bubble doesnt mean we cant cause any trouble
8361746 hey arent you that idiot from that moronic pauly shore movie i love you thats my favorite movie
8361747 i sure am incidentally have you accepted jesus as your lord and savior not only is christianity totally x treme but heaven is like bio dome only better
8361748 these kinds of fractures are really serious but we have an excellent vet who surgically repaired it today
8361749 at least his life was saved and at least his wing was saved
8361750 but we grabbed him by his legs and that was it
8361751 he had a pretty severely broken wing but it looks like hes going to make it
8361752 barack obama understands the most important barrel of oil is the one you don t use
8361753 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8361754 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8361755 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8361756 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8361757 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8361758 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8361759 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8361760 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8361761 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8361762 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing

8361765 the democratic national convention committee handed credentials to a record number of bloggers for the denver convention this week but more nevertheless appear to have gathered at the big tent adding to the lure of the unofficial venue is that the workspaces location on wynkoop street is around the corner from a multitude of restaurants and private parties including a massive tuesday reception organized by emilys list a late night jazz festival and an at amp t sponsored brewery bash
8361766 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8361767 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8361768 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8361769 the doctors have assured us that there was no need for any concern all he needs is good rest and check ups
8361770 he is not feeling very well and it is mainly due to fatigue
8361771 his holiness the dalai lama has been experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days
8361772 you have just experienced a taste of hell let us help you avoid an eternity of it
8361773 we are a good fielding side and that is a plus point raina played well but it was disappointing that we both got out together and could not get runs in the end
8361774 you need to put in a more disciplined effort while chasing jayasuriya gave us a good start but we did not back it up thushara has done very well with ball and bat
8361775 we should not take anything from india after winning the toss they put runs on the board we made a few errors on the way

8361782 we are going to establish the association for the disabled in every state teach them how to read and write that is for the deaf and dumb just to remove from them the stigma of their disability even those with mental disabilities the mad people on the streets are going to be part of the group because they are disabled
8361783 it is a religious duty of being a brothers keeper i feel concerned on them and it was not just a social function but a religious responsibility as one who worships his god i have always been concerned on how the disabled people are forgotten and stigmatized as if they committed heinous crimes
8361784 i was also moved by the inaction of governments and organizations that make no considerations for them especially in buildings they are left to street begging and we want to see if they can develop their own talents and skill through sensitization to help them realize their god given special gifts
8361785 i have made up my mind on this mission whether as a senator or not i will continue to assist the disabled it was designed from the spirit but we are hopeful that both the private and public sectors will assist us
8361786 i really really felt that she had the experience i experienced
8361787 i was a four time loser before i realized i was in the wrong game fifteen years in prison is a pretty tough way to find oneself its been said that adversity introduces a man to himself a whole lot of suffering has transformed an ex con into an honest man who is doing his best to make the world a better place one loaf of bread at a time

8361793 when she came out i think she was determined to let people know that we need to step up and elect barack obama and i think she did that
8361794 i think she hit all the right notes had all the right tone all the right enthusiasm and i think the accent will come tonight when her husband probably does the same thing
8361795 the question is will her more ardent supporters go along with her she didnt hold back at all which some people thought she might republicans tried to make the argument last night that she didnt say that he could lead but thats looking for something thats not there
8361796 the real question is were those hillary supporters really democrats or were they supporting her because of the fact that she would become the first woman running for president if some of them were just supporting her for the fact that she was a woman they may not go with her but the vast majority of her supporters will either support obama or just sit home
8361797 the party needs to unite that was her first point her second point was did those of you who voted for me vote for me or did you vote for the ideas that i represent and which the party represents by putting it in that context shes telling these people yes you voted for me because i represent these ideas but these ideas are also democratic party ideas and barack obama represents those ideas as well
8361798 she said them forcefully she said them directly she said them from the beginning of her speech and she peppered them throughout her speech unity vote for the ideas vote for barack obama he represents us now let us stand forth carry forth and now carry the election that was her message and that she is going to join the fight and join that movement to bring those ideas to fruition on behalf of the person who is now going to represent the party
8361799 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it was not appropriate
8361800 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8361801 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8361802 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8361803 it is very disappointing that he felt the need to express his upset with our service in this way customers can have any password they choose and it is not our policy to allow staff to change the password without the customers permission
8361804 it is important to understand that pancreatitis an inflammatory condition of the pancreas is a rare event
8361805 further the characteristics and complications of the pancreatitis cases in patients on byetta are consistent with pancreatitis in the general population we believe byetta continues to have a positive benefit risk profile for patients with type 2 diabetes
8361806 we remain concerned that the recent issues will prevent acceleration of the lar timeline and could delay approval if the incidence rate increases or further safety studies are required
8361807 building on our first quarter efforts we were able in the second quarter to demonstrate that we continue to have the focus and the discipline in place to drive substantial improvement even in the midst of a very challenging consumer environment
8361808 im pleased with how far weve come on these important measures in a relatively brief period of time all while operating in the midst of one of the most challenging times ive experienced in my retail career
8361809 in the extremely competitive u s market ricoh is committed to further strengthening its sales and support channels
8361810 during a second screening process a small amount of what was believed to be heroin and cocaine was discovered on her person
8361811 she is being booked at pacific division and then transferred to van nuys
8361812 if it cant be done i have great concern that these hearings will be virtually or exclusively classified closed to the public and i might add to the detainees
8361813 there comes a time when every dog has to be put down
8361814 our plan is to leave no doubt about the outcome
8361815 we dont want it to be close on the scorecard
8361816 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8361817 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8361818 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8361819 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8361820 we are strong hillary people but we will support the platform
8361821 i dont see that theres anything she could do more than what she said tonight to say weve got to support barack im happy with her now
8361822 its just what the democrats needed to pull us together
8361823 what joe biden said is that barack obama is not prepared to be president of the united states hillary clinton said the same thing
8361824 democrats fall a little closer to the lower classes than the republicans do i think theyve been a little closer to the hispanic community
8361825 when hispanic christians go to the voting booth they have a tough call to make do i go in there as a christian first or as a hispanic american first said samuel rodriquez with the national hispanic christian leadership conference
8361826 man and woman mom and dad in the home to us its the primary antidote to juvenile deliquency teen pregnancy gang activity and these are proven scientific facts
8361827 i dont think the platform will change the practicing catholic or the conservative evangelical its too little too late
8361828 the media pundits those on talk radio that basically speak on behalf of the republican party not officially but they become the de facto prophetic voices of the republican party and as a result youre alienating a naturally conservative base
8361829 no political party is above the law i have told the police to take stern action if there is any problem
8361830 every government department knows its job well the bmc will take care of the signboard deadline and the police will tackle street violence
8361831 all police stations have been instructed to deal sternly with any kind of vandalism
8361832 we will not back out we will not allow further insult of the marathi language
8361833 he had taken five or six steps back and then came running at me
8361834 he had the microphone which worried me for a split second
8361835 im not going to say im scared but it crossed my mind then he just jumped me
8361836 faster than you would like a grown man to come at you
8361837 and then he started gyrating his private area against me rather with some gusto and since my arms were locked i went like this and he went over my shoulder
8361838 youve met one person with autism im not like rain man not like einstein im not like thomas jefferson

8361855 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
8361856 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
8361857 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency
8361858 one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but we can always make it better
8361859 thats why were investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and have already hired 200 more inspectors with more to come
8361860 there has to be a shared responsibility there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible
8361861 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8361862 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8361863 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8361864 youre racing from place to place doing the paperwork and how much time does that realistically leave you to do inspection activities
8361865 even if your manager has the sense to tell you to use your discretion and judgment if you think you want to take a quick stroll through the plant youre often not going to have the time to do it anyway
8361866 theyve moved to a paper system whereby industry basically regulates itself so the big loss in terms of front line inspection happened long before the conservatives came onboard
8361867 the conservatives are simply doing another round in the same direction
8361868 we will not restart the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8361869 the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
8361870 im not going to be a slave for the negroes
8361871 bernstein adopted mahlers persona for himself he became the avatar of mahler though others had championed him bernstein kept plugging away for mahlers music in the concert hall on the airwaves through recordings and through his lectures in this mission bernstein also had the help of the lp record and that was important because the length scale and architecture of mahlers music was hard to convey on 78 records that could only play four or five minutes of music at a time
8361872 alma was the guardian of mahlers reputation in many ways she met bernstein and did get together with the bernsteins in the bernsteins apartment at the dakota just the fact that they were in the same time and place and did know each other is quite extraordinary
8361873 this year marks the 50th anniversary of bernsteins appointment as music director of the new york philharmonic and the 90th anniversary of bernsteins birthday but bernstein is worth celebrating any old time
8361874 the press used to criticize bernstein for that when he wrote for broadway he was slumming and conversely if he wrote for the concert hall he was being pretentious this view is passing works of bernsteins that were overlooked are now getting performances and holding up very nicely
8361875 the archives arent that dusty yet so theres a lot of information available bernstein himself provided so much information historians have to be very cautious about that because bernstein was aware that everything he did was being watched so he was pretty careful about getting across his story in the form he wanted but he was also very outspoken
8361876 bernstein was involved in so many aspects of our cultural life he was a composer conductor lecturer media personality
8361877 hemingway loved cuba because it was a place where he could be anonymous
8361878 somewhere he could live and write without being interfered with and bombarded for autographs
8361879 he seemed to have understood people and situations in a way that very few writers have
8361880 a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper

8361884 our daily search for the real story behind the story is joined by professional journalist dave barry who has a notepad and a pen what do we find an actual celebrity and some activists with a curious campaign

8361894 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8361895 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8361896 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8361897 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8361898 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8361899 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8361900 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8361906 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8361907 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in the third and i had to come back
8361908 when i was in a danger situation i was 4 2 down 40 love on her serve i think it was and i just realized i had to go more to the forehand because on the backhand she was making good shots
8361909 it kind of made me go outside of the court and just defend
8361910 and in second set i just start to be so much more confident in my game just making my moves you know depending on myself

8361912 weve refined our manufacturing techniques and redesigned our low density ssds to get what the low priced pc market is looking for in the way of improved cost performance and availability
8361913 ill deal with it when its time to get surgery
8361914 people like charlie crist where he is in the governors mansion they know romney who campaigned hard in this state
8361915 romney looks like he gives mccain more of an edge than biden gives obama
8361916 romney should bring mccain some of those conservatives and he could help with the economy
8361917 i anticipate supporting the ticket not being part of the ticket
8361918 mccain aides also are monitoring gustav which was a hurricane but weakened to a tropical storm in the caribbean it was threatening to hit the gulf coast almost exactly three years after hurricane katrina that has become a symbol of government incompetence under president bush should the storm hit the u s aides will have to decide whether to rework mccains upcoming schedule to send him to the region and whether doing so would be politically smart or not
8361919 but putting sarcasm aside governor romney is a fine person he would make a very strong vice president

8361924 we have played with avenged on some radio shows and shinedown but weve never had a chance to actually go out and put a bunch of dates together and feel like were out on the road with those guys so were really looking forward to that
8361925 when you go through the door to go into the airport you dont know if that line is going to be 20 minutes or 40 minutes or five minutes
8361926 with a clear card you know its going be five minutes or less
8361927 we cant reduce security on those people just because they have a card
8361928 whats here at baltimore washington is the compilation of multiple elements in technology in training in directing passengers
8361929 for a family coming in we want to make it easy as possible we want to really reduce their stress level so that the bad guys stand out
8361930 we have specially trained officers that are looking just at behavior
8361931 we are no longer looking for the scissors the tweezers for the things that make no security sense at all we are looking for people who have harmful intentions to get to those people we have to calm down the checkpoint
8361932 we have these signs that actually show the officer in uniform and the officer out of the uniform
8361933 talking about some of their hobbies explaining what they like to do outside of work when you see the officers picture and then you go and see the officer you make that human connection
8361934 these are people that live and work in your community just like you do
8361935 so weve really made an effort to show people that there is someone behind the uniform
8361936 one of the main things we heard from passengers was i dont want to be held up
8361937 if im a business traveler i know the rules dont slow me down
8361938 weve set it up so that you have some opportunities
8361939 this really gives passengers an opportunity to get ready for security once you leave the prep stop area youre really starting to get into the security process
8361940 the image is transferred to a remote location away from the checkpoint so that the officer looking at the image cannot see the person
8361941 the officer at the machine cannot see the image we also do not save store print forward or anything with any of the images
8361942 it seems like every airport is a little bit different
8361943 one possible explanation is that while women are breastfeeding they arent menstruating and so their hormones arent cycling
8361944 helps explain why some women are at higher risk and also why certain therapies are not effective against these more aggressive forms of breast cancer
8361945 today quality health care for all stands alone as the great unfinished business of 20th century progressive social legislation
8361946 we must now realize that our failed health care system is not just a moral challenge its a major economic liability too
8361947 democratic platform reflects the reality that making affordable meaningful health care a right for all not a privilege for some is essential to our economic future
8361948 while leaving millions of americans uninsured might seem to save money the inefficient care that the uninsured do receive taxes the entire health care system and economy
8361949 destructive dynamic in which high costs lead to more uninsured americans and more uninsured americans contribute to higher costs
8361950 every american has access to an affordable health plan thats portable and just as good as the one their member of congress has
8361951 attack cost by modernizing health care delivery reducing waste investing in information technology and controlling the cost of catastrophic illness
8361952 that is our plan rooted in a deep understanding of our current health care system a belief in smart policy that emphasizes the convergence of economic self interest and shared responsibility and reflective of years spent listening to the american people
8361953 has dusted off george bushs so called ownership society and claimed it as his own
8361954 could force 160 million americans to give up their current group health insurance and instead use an insufficient tax break to purchase a new individual plan in a market that regularly discriminates against the sick and the elderly
8361955 we will not seek any legal action and are still holding patience to clear the expressway of blockade
8361956 a fear psychosis is being created to slow down certain projects of national importance
8361957 the nano project is an unique and innovative initiative that will establish indias position as a small car hub indian industry must be encouraged to make such large investments in order to build the countrys competitiveness as well as support job creation

8361962 we still have an evaluation process after this game were going to have to cut 22 players this will be a game where a lot of guys are sitting as the 50th or 53rd guy and this game can make an impact sometimes its an important game for a lot of young players
8361963 you approach it this way youd like to play better than you did last week youd like to get some points on the board offensively but after this game the season starts and you want to get out of this game playing well with your first group but you also want to come out healthy you dont want to get anybody injured in the last pre season game especially a starter you need for opening day you enter it kind of cautiously
8361964 certain ones will play for a little while into the first and second quarter maybe
8361965 but they need some work and whats good is there are so many young players on this football team that need playing experience and that helps you
8361966 well were going to make a decision i dont want to go into opening day with two kickers on the roster i thought the two kids handled themselves very well over the last couple of days theyre still standing
8361967 we brought him in here and weve decided on the two that we liked and thats what were going to do
8361968 all coaches have a fondness for kickers i always say we make jokes and laugh but theyve got a tough job they only get one shot to kick the ball they get to try it over and over again and generally that one can win games tie games put you in position to win a game i know that ive been around them long enough its always a difficult situation to be in
8361969 right now hes scheduled to well get into warm ups and see where hes at but i think he wants to get some snaps in
8361970 charles is going to play and cottam were going to decide but hes got a chance theyre all dressing
8361971 brandon albert is going to dress well see where hes at
8361972 no i said well see im not saying yeah on that one
8361973 yeah that and the fact that when you say youre going to have competition is it really competition or are you just saying that
8361974 now feeley was out for a while and the other guys have been kicking that has something to do with it too but at the end these guys have been 85 or 86 charting all the kicks every day now theyve missed one in the game if you can get a kicker to kick 80 in the season you take that right now they are
8361975 we did it in a manner we were comfortable doing
8361976 if its a good veteran and we feel he fits in our system and does what we want him to do thats fine but you just dont go out and get a veteran just to say we got a veteran we did that a little bit last year and it didnt turn out too well at certain positions were going in another direction
8361977 yeah a little bit theyre young guys they have to be more disciplined in what they do its a new offense too the quarterback gets blamed for that when hes holding onto the ball people are wondering why doesnt he throw the ball sometimes you cant throw the ball when theyre covered or running the wrong route thats part of it brodie knows that hes playing with a lot of young guys
8361978 well we almost got to cthun but the expansion got us
8361979 dude office just ate the report for the stockholders and corrupted all my working copies ive gotta get last years copy from backups and hope neither god nor the sec catch me im gonna win for sure

8361983 i think nickson is healthy ready to go and confident
8361984 i guess its a nice feeling just to get womens tennis out there
8361985 there are women out there who are doing things in british tennis and its nice to know that its just not andy murray out there
8361986 its nice to kind of be with him at these events and share it with him
8361987 it just took me a little longer than others but this year it was quite significant for me to finally break into the top 100
8361988 now that thats kind of off my back i can just look ahead and keep working on other things im not where i want to be because i just want to keep climbing up in the rankings
8361989 before the match i really believed i had a chance to win and i knew if i could hang in there and just get stuck in id be in with a good shot
8361990 even though i lost my serve and went 4 2 down i never felt at that point i lost the match i felt if i just kept fighting and hanging in there my chance would come and i got there so im pretty pleased about it
8361991 i definitely dont think id be as successful as i am
8361992 he added that he has kept a active website running prior to the days of myspace for communicating with his fans
8361993 if im able to do something then it will be someday
8361994 at the very beginning there was this impression he had absconded with 500 million
8361995 it slowly eroded down but the number that most recently came in was 66 million of that 66 million which is actual loss only 8 million and i know thats a big number went to parishs clothes lifestyle and all that
8361996 most of the money he lost was not stealing for lifestyle benefits
8361997 it was being a big shot and going into a jewelry store and buying a 5 000 watch for 15 000
8361998 dont bother trying to seel to anyone but dan you have no shot at getting it approved

8362002 we attributed these review discrepancies to the contractors reliance on clinical inference rather than additional medical records available from health care providers cms inconsistent policies regarding proof of delivery documentation physicians lack of understanding of documentation requirements and cmss lack of procedures for obtaining information on high risk dme items from beneficiaries
8362003 i highly urge that the appropriations hearing be held in order to determine the cause of this alleged misreporting
8362004 given its centrality to medicares financial oversight mission we are eager to adopt any meaningful changes to the program that will help enhance measurement efforts in particular and our overall program integrity efforts in general
8362005 action by congress in july to delay and fix the deeply flawed dme competitive bidding program will not reduce or delay efforts to combat fraud
8362006 the exact opposite is true congress strengthened the accreditation requirements in the new medicare law and closed a loophole that would have allowed nonaccredited providers to serve medicare beneficiaries
8362007 effort to get to the bottom of the medicare fraud numbers but it was disappointing to see your article link two separate issues pricing through competitive bidding and fraud prevention
8362008 we will continue to support efforts by congress and federal agencies to find more effective ways of keeping criminals out of the medicare program

8362011 the flagship model for samsung in third quarter will be the samsung omnia slated for a september launch it brings together high performance business content style a touch screen menu and dynamic multimedia experience for consumers
8362012 by the year end we expect around 40 per cent of samsung mobile sales in india to come from the multimedia phone segment

8362017 these are buddhadebs personal opinions workers cannot quit their right to strike
8362018 the cm hasnt done the right thing perhaps he wanted to project his image as an administrator in front of the industry captains
8362019 i dont support any bandh i agree it is not helping anyone but unfortunately as i belong to one party and they call a strike i keep mum but i have finally decided that next time i will open my mouth
8362020 there can be discussion on any issue if he the bengal cm wants we can discuss the issue of bandhs and strikes too
8362021 there will definitely be a clarification on this issue but its too early to decide the form and the content
8362022 the problems of the smes are not because of unionisation but due to erroneous policies of the central government which in the name of competition promotes monopolisation of economic powers smes are worst victims of institutional credits unfortunately the industrial chamber is focusing on trade unions instead of real maladies
8362023 strikes do help the working class there are many examples where the pending issues have been resolved after the working class resorted to strike

8362028 this is what ive been waiting on its been a long time coming ive been very patient very quiet about everything
8362029 id be lying to you if i told you i wasnt nervous about saturday because i am
8362030 if thats what the stats say then thats what the stats say
8362031 didnt ever feel like i lost the job i think thats a bad way to look at it i want to go in for the win and not to lose
8362032 i dont think so right now ive been consumed from fighting for this job right now im going to keep working hard
8362033 i thought that was really important because it let me know how much confidence he has in me to run a successful offense
8362034 i think joe wants to see what happen for the rest of the season
8362035 i would hope its for the rest of the season but im not sure
8362036 i can feel his pain it was real close it could have easily went the other way
8362037 i will always tell him to be ready because is very capable of running the show
8362038 right now i am getting my visa as soon as it is ready i will fly to
8362039 i ran for president to renew the promise of america
8362040 staking her candidacy on a barrage of policy proposals that are completely untenable and focused mainly on inciting middle class anger toward a carefully chosen list of enemies
8362041 a clean energy economy that will create millions of green collar jobs a health care system that is universal high quality and affordable a world class education system and make college affordable again an america defined by deep and meaningful equality promoting unionization bring fiscal sanity back to washington end the war in iraq bring our troops home and honor their service by caring for our veterans
8362042 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8362043 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8362044 now is the time to go to the store stock on those batteries and those supplies dont wait till this weekend dont wait till whether we know the storm is coming here in 24 or 48 hours
8362045 im not prepared to say today what level storm we can protect against i can tell you the system is stronger today than it was pre katrina
8362046 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8362047 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8362048 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf then ill make my decisions
8362049 obama should be wiping the floor with mcsame but the race reminds me too much of 2000 and 2004 so close that rove and his minions could once again steal it
8362050 dont get too nervous bernie your guy should win mccain a catastrophe waiting to happen makes even the plutocrats nervous theyre doubling down by sending money obamas way as well he may not be their first choice but hes not radical and they can live with him
8362051 besides what youre witnessing now before labor day is just the usual jockeying for position trying out themes and ideas and ads see what works what sticks trying to brand your opponent etc
8362052 in a few weeks the name of the game starts to shift itll be g o t v get out the vote time and here your democrats should do gangbusters the republicans are fractured the far right ultraconservatives and many of the fundamentalists dont trust mccain theres not the same kind of passion for the gop candidate that energizes the democratic legions that will be sending money to and walking the streets and making phone calls for obama
8362053 but the democrats have their own fissures and fractures many progressives for example think obamas little more than a center rightist beholden to the same corporate interests theyve fought for decades plus many of hillary clintons dedicated supporters have said they wont support obama and may even vote for mccain or at the very least stay home
8362054 sure there were and are hard feelings among many hillary supporters but a good share of those are frustrated voters many of them women who once they examine mccains positions on abortion rights stem cell research health care and the like will never be able to vote for him
8362055 the point is that progressive democrats want to win this year and in their hearts know that despite whatever reservations they may have about obama hes their guy this time out for without the presidency the possibility of passing liberal let alone progressive legislation goes down the tubes the dems will win big in the congressional races maybe even big enough to create a filibuster proof majority in the senate but if mccain were to reside in the white house his veto pen could cause untold damage to the democratic agenda and his picks for the supreme court would be disastrous for social progress im not even mentioning his reckless fascination with war as a first choice option so virtually all progressive democrats even if they wish someone else were their candidate will vote for obama
8362056 but im still caught up in the politlcal puzzle the republican party is so distrusted and disliked in the country bushs favorable ratings have been in the low 20s for a year or two mccain is tied tightly to bushs failed policies and hes such a terrible campaigner such a crotchety old dude who may even be approaching the outskirts of senile dementia given all this how in hell is mccain doing so well in the national polls
8362057 come on bernie you know at least part of the answer in case you havent noticed there are a lot of folks out there especially in the republican party and especially in the states of the old south who wont vote for a black man period and in states like florida there are plenty of old jews whove swallowed the dirty tricks gop email circulating widely that falsely proclaims that obama is muslim and anti israel in both cases as you can see racism is still alive and well and living in america even among some democrats
8362058 but surely the percentage of those who think that way is no more than say 10 of the voting population whats leading so many others to mccains camp
8362059 but as i say the key in november 2008 is g
8362060 but in one sense i think rove sees the electoral handwriting on the wall as he did in 2006 when the democrats took back congress even though hed love to steal another one and put mccain into the white house that may prove impossible and he may scale down his definition of victory as keeping the dems from reaching a filibuster proof majority in the senate making sure theres a way for the republicans to block obamas policies from that chamber
8362061 but if the democratic campaigns get out the vote drive is successful obamas coattails can help the dems take the senate big
8362062 ive heard a lot of negative murmuring from progressives about biden as obamas running mate
8362063 you know yet another establishment democrat who voted for the iraq war and accepts the premise of the u s as an interventionist superpower and a liberal senator who voted for the bankruptcy bill and for other issues unpopular with the democratic base plus hes too full of himself shoots off his mouth too often and doesnt bring a big states electoral votes to the table
8362064 but hes a dynamic campaigner has a good sense of humor a powerful biography and balances out obamas weaknesses in the experience foreign policy national security areas plus hed probably make a decent president if it came to that again most democrats despite whatever misgivings they may have about either obama or biden will stick with the ticket all the way its their only shot
8362065 if hes dumb hell choose mitt romney two older ultra wealthy extremist white guys out of touch with the problems and desires of most of the country if hes smart hell choose a woman maybe senator kay bailey hutchison of texas or despite her own serious issues secretary of state condoleezza rice with rice he would get a two fer black and female take that obama maybe even rub the hillary supporters still smarting wound to the point where theyll stay away from the polls on election day
8362066 seems so cerebral and nuanced in his approach to his opponent that i worry that hes about to do a kerry turn off voters who really want someone who will put up a fight against the down and dirty campaign being waged by rove for mccain which has reached the scoundrel depths of questioning the patriotism of his opponent
8362067 thats where rove wants to fight since theyre well aware that obama would win on the issues
8362068 i think the professionals running the obama campaign know that after the convention the gloves have to come off and some bare knuckles fighting has to take place thats not obamas style but bidens a master at it let barack be barack and let biden be biden
8362069 albeit a traditional moderate republican why are you not supporting the gop candidate
8362070 in other words cheney bush would get a third term and the country and the constitution after what weve been through the past eight years cannot afford more gross misrule and unnecessary wars abroad
8362071 one last warning none of my and the democrats optimism will be realized unless the obama campaign is ready to fight ferociously in the courts for the right of everyone to vote and to have their votes counted honestly and there will be no victory unless the voting turnout for obama is absolutely humongous so you guys have a lot of work in front of you in the next two and a half months go do it
8362072 card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans health care
8362073 iava director if mccain thinks the va isnt working its in part because he hasnt funded it
8362074 well theyre just veterans did you know that for five years i didnt have healthcare i think all pows who have been held for over 5 years should get full benefits other veterans not so much
8362075 certitude belongs exclusively to those who only own one encyclopedia
8362076 avoid specific consideration of evils so appalling and so horrifying that we not only do not know why god permits them we cannot conceive of any plausible candidate reasons
8362077 evils the participation in which that is the doing or suffering of which constitutes prima facie reason to doubt whether the participants life could given their inclusion in it be a great good to him her on the whole
8362078 insofar as he wished to show the believers view contradictory and irrational he must take an interest whether 1 god is omniscient omnipotent and perfectly good and 2 evil exists can be understood as compossible on the believers construal of these claims

8362082 i was told that if i were to have an account it must be a joint account with a sighted person and the atm card must be under the persons name as well
8362083 i argued with him that i was given the application form by the bank employee and the person was aware of my condition but the manager refused to give me the pin number
8362084 i can hear the number being announced but how am i suppose to know the number on my ticket there are some banks with special counters which makes it convenient for us
8362085 on another incident when i went to apply for a housing loan i was told by the staff member to bring three copies of the sales and purchase agreement but when i returned with it they refused to give me a loan saying that i was an income earner isnt that a good thing
8362086 some of us are lucky to have atm cards as these banks most probably overlooked our condition and we know how to use these cards at the atm machine because we have memorised the procedures otherwise there is no braille on the punch points or any voice system like it is in singapore
8362087 due to this discrimination we have not been able to make progress in our business ventures it has also led us be victims of house robberies snatch thefts because we are forced to keep our cash with us

8362161 this is not only one of the biggest but also one of the best and most spectacular productions we have ever presented at the ahmanson but the technical demands are enormous and we must afford the creative team and cast the time to develop the show to the level of quality that it and our audiences deserve
8362162 oh whats two to three more days on a project that weve worked two to three years on the sets and the technical end of things are more involved on this musical than they were on the movie and its going to look fantastic
8362163 when pushed to their boiling point by their boss franklin hart jr marc kudisch violet newstead allison janney the super efficient office manager judy bernly stephanie j block a frazzled divorcee and the sexy executive secretary doralee rhodes megan hilty turn the tables on him the trio hatches a plan to get even with the sexist egotistical lying hypocritical bigot and that plan quickly spins wildly and hilariously out of control
8362164 everything looks great we dont need to see you for another six months
8362165 we dont need to see you for another six months
8362166 our assessment is that there will be a hung assembly in andhra pradesh with no single party in a position to get a clear majority on its own
8362167 the centre will have to agree for a cbi probe into the blast incidents at lucknow varanasi gorakhpur faizabad and rampur or else my government will not allow a cbi inquiry into the kanpur incident alone if the centre is ready to order cbi inquiry into all the blast incidents we will send them a recommendation immediately i have already sent a letter to the centre clarifying my stand on the issue
8362168 the blasts in faizabad and varanasi in the previous regime are also being investigated by these agencies the centre has never offered to set up a cbi inquiry into any of these cases
8362169 the congress knows that if the up police continues to probe the kanpur blast case the entire truth will be out in the open and those who are trying to spread terror in up will be exposed it is clear that the upa government is sympathetic towards the bjp and its affiliated organisations and wants to help them
8362170 but the centre turned down our request saying that they had a shortage of officers in the cbi they even defied a allahabad high court order that had ordered a cbi probe into the police recruitment scam
8362171 our assessment is that there will be a hung assembly in andhra pradesh with no single party in a position to get a clear majority on its own
8362172 they mns workers are well educated and have good careers my marathi police brothers mns party workers will take to the streets only because of their love towards maharashtra and marathi these bhaiyas baniyas and some suryaji pisal betrayers among us do not understand the language of love and request the mns will have to speak the language they understand these children mns workers will sacrifice their careers and take to streets only to protect your culture
8362173 in pune my well educated party workers were beaten up so badly that some of them had blood coming out with urine young educated girls and boys were implicated in such cases which can destroy their lives remember these are all your children like other children they can also keep themselves engaged in enjoying music and having fun but then maharashtra and marathi language will be destroyed will it be acceptable to you and your next generations

8362180 i got home today to discover that my tivo was recording something i did not schedule for some strange reason it was recording channel 22 for seven hours under the impression that it was coverage of the democratic national convention
8362181 just so you know we know that rushs moving pictures isnt up yet
8362182 there is a technical difficulty that is being worked out ill alert you when it is all clear
8362183 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it was not appropriate
8362184 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8362185 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8362186 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8362187 it is very disappointing that he felt the need to express his upset with our service in this way customers can have any password they choose and it is not our policy to allow staff to change the password without the customers permission
8362188 i have some jeans in the limo cant wait to get back there
8362189 i used to play with barbies and stuff but that just got too boring
8362190 i was really quiet mostly liked to draw and maybe go to the mall
8362191 but when i got on that field it changed me i was very controlling and loud maybe too loud
8362192 but when i started playing and we started winning they liked me
8362193 at one of her first games she hit one of the other boys and i mean hit him broke his arm actually after that i knew she could handle herself
8362194 shes the best all around player ive coached next to washington redskins wide receiver antwaan randle el
8362195 she does it all scramble throw and shes a true leader
8362196 couldnt do anything wrong the closest i come to feeling like that is when i get straight as
8362197 at first i didnt believe it who wants to make a movie about me i was just a girl who loves sports whats the big deal
8362198 playing quarterback in any league and no matter what age is the hardest position in sports
8362199 for jasmine to do it and to take her team to the championship despite all of the obstacles everyone telling you cant do it to me is incredible shes a very brave and very strong girl
8362200 the real obstacle is the older generation of women who think their daughters should stay at home and cook dinner
8362201 she was an inspiration to a lot of girls who didnt know that football was even an option
8362202 she also changed the way coaches and old school people whove been around football all their lives approach this the thinking was what can a girl possibly add jasmine provided the answer
8362203 the movie was great and hopefully it gets me some attention from college basketball programs
8362204 mostly i just hope the movie gets more girls playing football and helps show the boys that were equal that would be really good
8362205 we may well make it the capital of a future region

8362207 in our rush to develop the country we are making mistakes
8362208 we stand for preservation and modernization going hand in hand
8362209 there is a danger that expanding the imam ali shrine and building more hotels could mean demolishing parts of the old city
8362210 we support the development of the city in the best possible way
8362211 but we want the work done in a way that respects the spirit of a city that hosts imam ali

8362249 i expect that the vast majority of the activists that supported her will back obama for many of the reasons she described last night

8362258 we have to continue to do what weve been doing which is build up the afghan national security forces provide basic humanitarian assistance and to work on border security

8362373 what it all boils down to with cibc is the fact that the market was looking for writeoffs from the capital markets to be in the neighbourhood of 1 5 billion or more they came in at 885 million
8362374 although it hurt earnings it left the balance sheet in much better shape than everyone was expecting
8362375 three percent is fairly modest if you look at the national growth

8362381 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
8362382 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency

8362386 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8362387 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8362388 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8362389 youre racing from place to place doing the paperwork and how much time does that realistically leave you to do inspection activities

8362398 the cyclical upswing in commodity prices from the low in october 2001 at 226 8 per cent is now virtually on par with the huge 235 1 per cent advance in the 1970s in the aftermath of the arab oil embargo
8362399 the strength of this upswing is a testimony to the remarkable growth of emerging market demand this decade in the face of significant supply constraints in many resource sectors

8362489 el ejecutivo nacional crear un punto de interconexi n o punto de acceso a la red de proveedores de servicios de internet con la finalidad de manejar el tr fico con origen y destino en el espacio geogr fico de la rep blica
8362490 la preocupaci n es sobre los mecanismos de control de contenidos que pueda aplicar el gobierno si s lo se tiene un solo punto de interconexi n
8362491 qu garant a hay de que no exista un control de la sociedad y que este punto de acceso a la red no va afectar el acceso a determinado tipo de informaciones
8362492 tiene que demostrar el estado la necesidad de hacer esa reserva sobre los medios radioel ctricos y las telecomunicaciones
8362493 lo que hay es una extensi n de las atribuciones del ejecutivo y sin ning n tipo de control institucional son decisiones unilaterales
8362494 lo vamos a conocer perfectamente pero hasta los momentos no existe
8362495 las versiones son mentiras que no benefician a nadie que no contribuyen a la formaci n de una sociedad m s democr tica sino todo lo contrario aqu juegan intereses de grupos de monopolios que no se conforman que no se quedan tranquilos con los procesos de cambio que el pueblo viene impulsando

8362537 the gestures the non verbals that give us the emotion really werent there
8362538 one of the things that you see is she has very limited hand gestures and we look for hand gestures to tell us whats important so when we see them out when we see them up this is significant and we saw them just a few times last night but not enough this was not an impassioned speech

8362545 i do not believe nyra has the 4 million to pay that out there would be substantial cash flow issues

8362548 the competitive bidding scheme on its face applies to all contracts regardless of value and it provides for no exceptions

8362552 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
8362553 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
8362554 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
8362555 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8362556 se vuoi che sia io a compiere il gesto lo far ma a una condizione
8362557 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche quando il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scarti e bonacceprolungate ma passa persino per me

8362611 framing technique can be used as a public relations strategy in cases of sexual assault
8362612 duke university officials framed the crisis in terms of institutional reputation rather than the rape issue at hand
8362613 in the end the charges against the duke athletes turned out not to be true but for nearly nine months duke lived with allegations that three student athletes might have raped a student at a nearby university duke focused on its own reputation but missed an opportunity to talk about the larger issue of rape
8362614 sexual violence is a serious matter and organizations that find themselves confronting such charges even charges they suspect may not be true need to speak clearly and strongly to the issue of rape

8362617 current counter narcotics policies are failing to address the loss of the southern provinces to the dual scourges of poppy production and terrorism
8362618 this decrease is no more than a ripple in the ocean
8362619 without an urgent change of direction in the countrys counter narcotics policies the international community will be unable to prevent the consolidation of opium production in the south of the country and the consolidation of the taliban which is financed by the illegal drugs trade
8362620 crop eradication has failed to reduce these provinces opium output while succeeding to push impoverished afghan farmers further into the arms of the taliban insurgency

8362631 compared to bannys recent outings this was a major upgrade
8362632 he pitches quite a few games like that where we dont score a whole lot of runs seems like theyre always close games
8362633 i think he webb probably didnt have his best stuff
8362634 but even when he doesnt have his best stuff hes got quality stuff to get you out we did a good job of waiting him out and getting balls that were up in the zone
8362635 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8362636 they werent going after bad pitches and were hitting strikes
8362637 when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
8362638 were having trouble scoring runs and everybody probably goes up there squeezing the sawdust out of the bats
8362639 i dont think theres any magic formula other than keep going out there and fighting the frustration we seem to be experiencing
8362640 things like this you hope to learn from and get better
8362641 you cant lose games like that when youre running out of time you cant let games like that get away
8362642 its a tough loss but there are still plenty of games to play
8362643 we had a lot of fun today we didnt have any pressure

8362655 sen barack obama d illinois reported assets of between 456 000 and 1 1 million making it unclear if he is a millionaire he and his wife had total income of 984 000 in 2006 including 567 000 in royalties for two books he has written in 2005 obama received a 1 9 million book advance
8362656 sen barack obama d illinois reported assets of between 456 000 and 1 1 million making it unclear if he is a millionaire he and his wife had total income of 984 000 in 2006 including 567 000 in royalties for two books he has written in 2005 obama received a 1 9 million book advance
8362657 obama wants to give you a tax cut and raise taxes on himself and john mccain whereas john mccain wants to give himself his wife a tax cut and obama a smaller one
8362658 the choice in november for tax policy may be the largest voters have ever had in this country
8362659 john mccains tax cut is far larger more regressive and far more radical than anything president george w bush has ever proposed barack obama is proposing one of the largest income tax cuts for the middle class in american history
8362660 when the little people have money in their pocket they tend to spend that money thereby increasing demand
8362661 k eep in mind on all of these proposals what i have said is lets make sure that we define the well off so that were not hitting the middle class i generally define well off as people who are making 250 000 a year or more and that means for example if we raise the capital gains tax i would exempt people who are essentially small investors and really capture the those who have done very very well over the last two decades
8362662 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
8362663 if the top 1 pays more in taxes than the entire bottom 95 of tax payers woudlnt you agree this is unfair
8362664 the man of great wealth owes a particular obligation to the state because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of government
8362665 this is a momentous decision compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guant namo bay and return him home to britain
8362666 it is a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained by torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used as evidence in any trial
8362667 hugely dependent in a number of areas on us intelligence
8362668 any disclosure however limited would seriously undermine this principle to the point that future cooperation between the uk and its most valuable intelligence partner the us would be severely jeopardised
8362669 it was accepted on behalf of the foreign secretary that bm binyam mohamed had established an arguable case i that over the period april 2002 to may 2004 he was first held by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer or a court or tribunal in pakistan and then detained there or elsewhere by the united states until his arrival in guant namo bay in september 2004 ii that he was subject to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment by or on behalf of the united states during such detention and iii that he was subject to torture during such detention by or on behalf of the united states
8362670 the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
8362671 that on the basis that what was done was arguably wrongdoing the sys security service facilitated it in the manner and to the extent described
8362672 conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when bm was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan in the period april 2002 until at least may 2002 the court also concluded that the security service continued to facilitate the interviewing of bm by providing information and questions after 17 may 2002 in the knowledge of what was reported to them as to the circumstances of his detention and treatment in pakistan
8362673 uk is under no obligation under international law to assist foreign courts and tribunals in assuring that torture evidence is not admitted
8362674 if it is correct that in the course of an interrogation in which material supplied by the defendant the british government was employed the claimant binyam mohamed was tortured then it is arguable that there is an obligation to disclose material which may assist claimant in establishing before the american military court that he was tortured whether the court should exercise its discretion not to order disclosure can only be determined at a full hearing
8362675 could be considered exculpatory or might otherwise be relevant in the context of proceedings before the military commissions
8362676 the united kingdom armed forces are trained in the laws of armed conflict set out in the geneva conventions the joint services intelligence organisations training documentation states that the following techniques are expressly and explicitly forbidden a physical punishment of any sort b the use of stress positions c intentional sleep deprivations d withdrawal of food water or medical treatment and three other specified techniques
8362677 must have appreciated that it rendition was contrary to the rule of law
8362678 however they are described are entitled to the same levels of protection
8362679 hooding withholding of blankets and sleep deprivation of a detainee in afghanistan
8362680 a united states official had referred to getting a detainee ready which appeared to involve sleep deprivation hooding and the use of stress positions
8362681 with regard to the status of the prisoners under the various geneva conventions and protocols all prisoners however they are described are entitled to the same levels of protection you have commented on their treatment it appears from your description that they may not be being treated in accordance with the appropriate standards given that they are not within our custody or control the law does not require you to intervene to prevent this that said hmgs her majestys government stated commitment to human rights makes it important that the americans understand that we cannot be party to such ill treatment nor can we be seen to condone it
8362682 my friend and die hard clinton supporter john vigna said so tonight hillary elected barack obama he is right i do not have any more significant qualms about voting for senator obama
8362683 mondays speeches were all about getting to know who obama is it is working and i have been learning so much about this man

8362933 rakyat terlau ghairah untuk melihat perubahan dalam politik negara keputusan tersebut juga menunjukkan rakyat sudah tidak dapat menerima pemimpin yang masih berselindung di sebalik pembangunan serta penyalahgunaan kuasa serta amalan kronisma dan nepotisma yang masih berlaku
8362934 dalam pilihan raya kecil ini juga kita menyaksikan barisan nasional menggunakan seluruh jentera kerajaan

8362938 i make this plea not to treat too harshly those who tell you a story having observed carefully without having established that they are sure that the story is the whole story and the general story
8362939 the neglect of fact is the price paid for achieving comprehensibility now and the important issue is not whether people do it but whether they do it well
8362940 t he process of formulating a question has a great psychological effect on the questioner it focuses his sic attention on what he thinks he wants to know

8362944 this claim was not raised on the evening of the 15th when we informed mr boras that major league baseball had confirmed that the contract was submitted in a timely fashion
8362945 mr boras asserted this claim several days later after all of the draft signings had become publicized
8362946 the pirates are confident that the contract reached with pedro alvarez was agreed to and submitted to major league baseball in a timely fashion and properly accepted by major league baseball
8362947 in fact the contract between the kansas city royals and eric hosmer another boras client was submitted to the office of the commissioner after our contract with pedro was submitted
8362948 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8362949 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8362950 the pirates made several attempts to commence negotiations immediately following the draft and were willing and ready to agree to pay pedro a 6 million signing bonus from the very outset
8362951 predictably however mr boras refused to engage in any negotiations at all until shortly before the aug 15 deadline and even then an agreement was reached only after pedro took control of the negotiations
8362952 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more to his liking
8362953 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8362954 the office of the commissioner has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary
8362955 despite our disappointment we continue to believe in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system we will sit down with pedro and his family as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and much more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8362956 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8362957 i knew there was a possibility so it wasnt a complete shock when i got called in and was told i would be scratched from the lineup due to precautionary reasons the club was in discussions for possibly moving me
8362958 if thats the case if im moved to a club that has postseason possibilities you cant be disappointed as a player
8362959 ive had a lot of fun here and ive been happy with bobby cox and the organization
8362960 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8362961 im pleased to have derrick signed and have these contract negotiations behind us
8362962 this was a long and challenging process for the player and for the team this was a good example of the problem commissioner roger goodell has cited with the lack of a rookie pay scale were all happy that derrick can now focus on getting on the field being a jaguar and contributing to this team
8362963 im relieved to have the contract done and im excited to join my teammates
8362964 i allowed my agent to do his job and represent me and in the end it was so important for me to get this wrapped up so i could get here and get started
8362965 its painful for me to either watch or listen to myself but even when youre not fully satisfied with the outcome thats what makes you hungry but there is gratification in the fact that you a make people smile b make people dance c make people laugh or d make people make babies
8362966 joes pub can offer us the highest quality sound a spectacular stage comfortable seats and food

8362968 saskatchewan represents the final step in the consolidation of our national directories platform and this announcement represents a significant strategic move for us and for consumers and businesses in the province

8362970 beer and football are pretty synonymous theyve got the same demographics
8362971 we are basically extending their brand franchise and our relationship with them in a unique way
8362972 most of the things that we do have centred around greater vancouver and vancouver island because the beer is listed in government owned liquor stores it reaches our fans throughout the province
8362973 dont gay couples have the right to be as miserable as straight married ones
8362974 panhandling is a fact of life and were trying to point out that we can talk about those facts of life on cfrb
8362975 if theres a particularly hot topic that pops up on cfrb we might use it as inspiration the challenge is getting scale but thats the challenge with every guerrilla campaign we try to find as many high profile locations as we can recognizing that no single execution will have a ton of reach
8362976 its very difficult to come up with original news talk positioning
8362977 we were going back and forth on the virgin creative but they dropped this creative for cfrb in front of us and we thought thats it perfect we knew right away these guys had hit it out of the park

8362980 he can make plays at top speed he can play the wing or center ice there is nothing not to like about him
8362981 everybody comes to camp to compete for a job and hell have to do the same thing
8362982 hes been one of the best college hockey players in the country he was a first round draft pick those are the things that build the expectation and i think he has those expectations for himself but it does come down to how he does in september

8362986 the day that this country ceases to be free for irreligion it will cease to be free for religion except for the sect that can win political power
8362987 a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away
8362988 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
8362989 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
8362990 its a very friendly ride the scenery is beautiful and i think my favorite part is the railroad trestles and looking down on the tops of the trees
8362991 i like that as you ride down the trail and approach the creeks you can feel the temperature change and you can listen to the creeks as youre passing the wildflowers are pretty too
8362992 we get a lot of people who come just to go through the tunnel and then turn around and come back
8362993 it was a little curious because we were getting dripped on and i wasnt sure what was dripping i kind of wondered about that about a third of the way through you kind of learn that if you go in a single file you can use each others headlamps to follow
8362994 being new to the area it gives you a very nice snapshot of the region and from the railroad stops and names you get an appreciation for the history
8362995 i think all age groups and skill levels could ride this if you want to make it tougher you can go up and it looks like there are plenty of other things for people to do along the trail
8362996 you could take a section one day and explore it maybe do a hike too and then another section another day another thing i like about the trail is that you can speed ahead if you want to zoom around or just pedal next to each other and chat
8362997 one of the goals of the greenway all along has been to have connected regional trails that lead you all the way from puget sound to ellensburg and beyond and i tend to look at the iron horse as just this amazing spine of that trail network
8362998 bernstein adopted mahlers persona for himself he became the avatar of mahler though others had championed him bernstein kept plugging away for mahlers music in the concert hall on the airwaves through recordings and through his lectures in this mission bernstein also had the help of the lp record and that was important because the length scale and architecture of mahlers music was hard to convey on 78 records that could only play four or five minutes of music at a time
8362999 alma was the guardian of mahlers reputation in many ways she met bernstein and did get together with the bernsteins in the bernsteins apartment at the dakota just the fact that they were in the same time and place and did know each other is quite extraordinary
8363000 this year marks the 50th anniversary of bernsteins appointment as music director of the new york philharmonic and the 90th anniversary of bernsteins birthday but bernstein is worth celebrating any old time
8363001 the winds are blowing the right way for leonard bernstein right now
8363002 the press used to criticize bernstein for that when he wrote for broadway he was slumming and conversely if he wrote for the concert hall he was being pretentious this view is passing works of bernsteins that were overlooked are now getting performances and holding up very nicely
8363003 the archives arent that dusty yet so theres a lot of information available bernstein himself provided so much information historians have to be very cautious about that because bernstein was aware that everything he did was being watched so he was pretty careful about getting across his story in the form he wanted but he was also very outspoken
8363004 bernstein was involved in so many aspects of our cultural life he was a composer conductor lecturer media personality a great celebrity host literary and artistic people were in his orbit he advocated for civil and human rights he threw a party in his home to raise money for the legal defense of the black panthers he lived at a really vibrant time of american history and was music director of the new york philharmonic during the 1960s the decade when the united states was going haywire and during this time he was at the center of the cultural world

8363008 it was surprising and it was disappointing but im very happy that nothing bad happened to our children or our staff
8363009 the cip from 2000 from stem to stern is nothing more than a train wreck
8363010 it was one of the sloppiest jobs of management that you could possibly have
8363011 frankly im disgusted with the whole process we seem to be our own worst enemy to keep making missteps that cause people to mistrust us
8363012 and its just going to take time and people are just going to have to watch us and theyre going to have to work with us
8363013 we will develop an improvement plan to address the needs of those students and im confident that our professional development committees and our instructional leaders have already started to address those issues and we have been watching our subgroup achievement over the past several years
8363014 it might appear that missouri has more schools where students are not achieving at high levels like some other states when the fact the of the matter is our state exam is one of the most difficult state exams in the entire country

8363035 slow strengthening is forecast once gustav moves away from haiti and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two
8363036 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8363037 if residents make individual and family preparations they make it easier for first responders to focus on people who cant help themselves and need help first

8363041 these are the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time
8363042 the defense welcomes this acknowledgment by the prosecution that fully half of the charges involving half of the alleged victims could never be proven
8363043 and by the time the trial has concluded the remaining charges will either be dismissed or mr anand jon alexander will be found not guilty
8363044 these charges can never be resubmitted during this trial and the defense would strenuously oppose any refiling of these charges in the future after mr alexander has been totally acquitted of the remaining charges

8363102 the theory that all whites are the immediate enemy and all blacks our brothers making them loyal is silly and indicative of a lazy mind to be generous since it could be a fascist plot

8363219 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8363220 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the bmw 3 series

8363351 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8363352 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8363353 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8363354 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8363355 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8363380 nos declaramos en pie de guerra en tanto y cuanto el gobierno de evo morales persista en imponer un modelo totalitario y racista
8363381 para demostrarle al prefecto mario coss o y sus seguidores que la gente est cansada de la manipulaci n pol tica de los paros
8363382 una jornada c vica con episodios violentos aislados promovidos por manifestantes del movimiento al socialismo
8363383 pido a la justicia boliviana que sea muy justa con nuestras instituciones con nuestra polic a nacional agredida injustamente pido una profunda investigaci n para dar con los autores o agresores
8363384 los cobardes y constantes ataques perpetrados a nuestros camaradas pueden tener un trasfondo pol tico pero en los hechos se trata de un acto delictivo llevado adelante por sujetos que han cometido un delito flagrante de la forma m s alevosa y premeditada
8363385 quiero decirles con toda firmeza y sin dudar que no permitiremos m s ultrajes a nuestra instituci n del orden y mucho menos el atropello a la investidura de nuestras autoridades y efectivos policiales
8363386 sobre la manera de algunas autoridades departamentales que quieren que se quiebre la institucionalidad en el nombramiento de nuestros mandos queremos ser enf ticos para recalcar que la polic a nacional tiene como base de su actuar a la constituci n pol tica del estado y a la ley org nica de la polic a nacional y las leyes de la rep blica
8363387 este es s lo un precalentamiento para el partido final
8363388 que en ella se disuelva y le sea leve la tierra

8363391 revoluci n democr tica y cultural boliviana hasta con la vida
8363392 el ritmo del cambio es a menudo no menos importante que la direcci n del cambio mismo
8363393 el bloqueo se ha iniciado esta madrugada y depender de la voluntad del gobierno para levantar la medida
8363394 a trav s de mecanismos constitucionales a nuevos actores pol ticos en el redise o de las instituciones republicanas
8363395 primero por un profundo descontento ciudadano con las instituciones democr ticas en especial con los partidos pol ticos y el congreso segundo por los graves problemas econ micos y sociales del pa s
8363396 la ruptura respecto a la forma tradicional de organizaci n de partidos y la aparici n de nuevos actores a partir del componente regional y de las organizaciones ind genas campesinas van cuestionando las formas tradicionales
8363397 el pa s padece de conflictos man aco compulsivos donde todos protestan o bloquean
8363398 no se apagan con trapito h medo sino con medidas mucho m s profundas y efectivas como la predisposici n al di logo
8363399 hasta este momento no se ha iniciado el di logo respectivo que el gobierno hab a solicitado en primera instancia este di logo convoc justamente a los prefectos y alcaldes de todos los departamentos de bolivia que en primera instancia participaron unos 8 prefectos exceptuando al prefecto de santa cruz que aduj enfermedad para su ausencia
8363400 creemos que realmente la situaci n no est conforme a lo que el gobierno pensaba en primera instancia de tomar en cuenta los respectivos estatutos auton micos en la nueva constituci n pol tica a aprobarse para tal efecto es necesaria la uni n de los diferentes prefectos a nivel nacional a objeto de poner sus observaciones o introducir las reformas que quieren dentro de lo que denominan ellos la autonom a o los estatutos auton micos
8363401 la oposici n frente al no existir el di logo respectivo ha radicalizado mucho m s sus acciones consisten en un paro que han hecho de 24 horas posteriormente han hecho bloqueo de caminos y ahora est n en instancia de hacer cierre de fronteras
8363402 incluso tratan de asaltar a las instituciones p blicas y yo creo que estamos yendo contra lo que es el verdadero derecho que tiene cada ser humano creemos que todos tenemos la obligaci n de precautelar el orden las instituciones p blicas porque son del mismo pueblo salen de nosotros de nuestros propios impuestos
8363403 destruirlos constituye una flagrante violaci n a las leyes y lo que pedir a en ese sentido es que sea la iglesia cat lica o los organismos internacionales los que convoquen nuevamente a este di logo porque solamente a trav s del di logo se van a poder conseguir las metas que propone el gobierno
8363404 tiende a agravarse efectivamente justamente porque la radicalizaci n de sus medidas no son nada halag e as para conseguir un objetivo se tiene que ceder desde ambas partes y el gobierno ya ha cedido ha dicho que va a haber di logo que estamos en ese camino
8363405 cuando se est por querer conseguir ese di logo viene otra exigencia la solicitud de la devoluci n del idh a las prefecturas ese idh ya ha sido utilizado gestionado y aprobado mediante ley financial as que no se puede modificar se tendr a que hacer una modificaci n de la ley financial y solamente de esa forma se va a poder conseguir si es que quieren la devoluci n del idh
8363406 hay una acumulaci n hist rica de problem ticas que generan la presente coyuntura de crisis cuando las condiciones institucionales y pol ticas han sido quebradas y cuando lo conservador ha sido quebrado por lo emergente
8363407 para comprender el proceso y la asamblea constituyente en bolivia es importante tener en cuenta que existe un conjunto de problem ticas que hist ricamente se han acumulado y que tradicionalmente ha estado presentes y ahora emergen con fuerza
8363408 no se trata de una mera conflictividad pol tica entre un partido y la oposici n entre el gobierno central y los gobiernos departamentales o de centralismo versus autonom a
8363409 si en la colonia y la rep blica el fuerte de la econom a era la miner a en el altiplano en la actualidad ocupan una posici n prioritaria la agroindustria en santa cruz y la industria petrolera

8363413 yo he encontrado a mi hija y la justicia se va a encargar de las cosas que se tienen que hacer judicialmente y no es como todos han dicho o han dejado decir o han hecho de esto una fama realmente

8363416 de todos modos coment en otro momento es mi hija yo estoy desesperada en este momento porque mi hija se encuentre con su familia con sus hermanos que est n desesperados por verla y yo estoy muy agradecida muy contenta
8363417 la verdad que 40 d as es una tortura me imagino que para mucha gente que a n no ha encontrado a sus hijos debe ser algo terrible pero yo estoy pasando un momento en que estoy muy contenta
8363418 lo nico que puedo decir es que estoy muy contenta que he encontrado a mi hija realmente est muy bien ella vamos a seguir por medio de la justicia y la ayudar n todos los profesionales
8363419 ha sido revisada por los m dicos de or n y salvador maza en salta y est bien

8363423 were concerned about all of our fighters we always want to make sure theyre healthy
8363424 james brown is an excellent player porter said i think he could play at the highest level theres no doubt about it
8363425 somebody has obviously got to take a chance on him but he is a fantastic player left foot right foot can score with both feet great in the air works ever so hard and brings other people into play there is not much more you want from a young player
8363426 if he can get a chance and start training and playing with the best in the country in the premier league you are going to bring even more out of him
8363427 obviously the gaffer danny wilson had it right i know a lot of people were wondering whether james should have played out wide last year or up front but obviously it has worked he is hungry now and he looks like he is enjoying it up front whereas after the injury maybe he wasnt as hungry as he is now hes relishing it
8363428 i did my pre season and i have been given a chance to play by the manager he said i am here to give 100 per cent now and i am committed to the club ive got another year and we will just see what happens after that
8363429 we just shut him down during the week and roll him out for games he bullied danny shittu and gary cahill
8363430 adebayo has physical presence and he is a big player for us he is gutted not to get a hat trick he suffered a head wound against cheltenham and it reopened last saturday we just keep stitching him up bandaging him up and putting him out there
8363431 he is still not 100 per cent as he is coming to terms have the steel rod taken out but he is making progress
8363432 we will enjoy the cup run it is a great achievement to reach the third round for the first time in 26 years
8363433 i know there were a lot of changes on both sides but it still shows how far we have come as a football club when we can compete with and beat a premier league side i thought we controlled the game from the start of the second half
8363434 the better team won there is no doubt about swansea played some fantastic football
8363435 we looked organised in the first half but it all went out of the window in the second half we lost our shape and discipline and matt duke kept us in it
8363436 as a collective the team were far too disorganised and dishevelled in the second half and we lost the game
8363437 retail pharmacies face a significant challenge when it comes to meeting consumer demands and building loyalty
8363438 self service technology gives pharmacies the opportunity to minimize wait times for their customers a key factor for increasing satisfaction and overall convenience it also enables pharmacists to spend less time receiving prescriptions which frees them up to focus on more productive tasks such as answering medication specific questions

8363465 by contrast the dems tv reservations for this fall put about two thirds of their projected spending on offense against the gop thats a huge huge disparity in the dems favor and portends more massive gains for them this fall

8363471 a worthy successor to tight shot allmans insider view of the seamier side of hollywood is not only hip and entertaining but also has something serious to say about our insatiable hunger for tabloid thrills
8363472 barbed breezy and often pretty funny sharp and entertaining allman can be very funny and
8363473 allman turns a very sardonic pen loose on hollywoods glitz and glamour crowd in this entertaining first novel an impressive debut and an almost sure thing for a sequel
8363474 allman clearly knows those of whom he writes hes got l a nailed
8363475 and this fall we are going to pick up more seats
8363476 to me the most important thing right now is the budget crisis
8363477 it just shows again that the solution they have in sacramento is just a temporary solution
8363478 the governor believes californians ought to have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
8363479 when ive been on the road hitting 87 of my 100 town tour everyone is really anxious because it seems like the price of everything is going up and everything is going up except their paychecks

8363485 in any given situation the will of god is not necessarily an easy thing to discover
8363486 for godwins law to apply the comments which stem from the article in question needs to evolve into something wherein nazi germany and or hitler is invoked to prove a point
8363487 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8363488 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8363489 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland
8363490 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8363491 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8363492 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8363493 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8363494 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen

8363502 i am honored to be able to serve in this role and to contribute to the universitys growth under the leadership of president harker and monica taylor
8363503 i was drawn to the university for many reasons one being the transformation it will undergo over the next several years the path to prominence is the ideal strategy to ensure that the university of delaware exceeds its goal of being recognized as a premier public university
8363504 endless possibilities for us to connect with our alumni and expand our communications in a real time medium

8363518 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8363519 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8363520 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8363521 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8363522 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8363523 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8363524 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8363525 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8363526 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8363527 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8363528 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8363529 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates

8363555 its a losing strategy particularly in more freedom minded states like colorado
8363556 despite these losses the religious right is still on the warpath in colorado
8363557 this election theyre attempting to force gods law on the state via amendment 48 the ballot measure which would grant fertilized eggs all the legal rights of persons in the colorado constitution if passed and implemented the amendment would criminalize abortion as murder and ban the the birth control pill it would be a disaster for the men and women of colorado
8363558 its political suicide the democrats will only alienate the majority of americans committed to the principle of secular government
8363559 who can those voters support when both republicans and democrats seek to govern by their personal faith rather than rational principles
8363560 to protect freedom of religion and conscience republican and democratic leaders must embrace the separation of church and state on principle politicians should govern according to the secular principles of individual rights enshrined in the u s constitution not religious scripture

8363610 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8363611 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8363612 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8363613 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8363662 if you dont hear from me in 6wks move on
8363663 we are to take the title literally yes its not necessarily about a guy trying to kill the other guy because there are obvious implications when they happen to share the same body but he is figuratively his own worst enemy and they are both vying for supremacy within the same body and they are locked into a game of zero competition with one another where one person wins and one person loses on certain fronts obviously so if edward wants to have a life and he wants to go off somewhere hes obviously anchored to a certain reality because of henry so they do come to cross purposes and thats where the drama is

8363671 if one espouses the belief that the more the number of competitors the lower the price one could assume from that that with this high concentration of refiners in canada that we are paying a higher price at the wholesale level
8363672 while it may be of little consolation to canadians the volatility we have recently witnessed is not unique to canada
8363673 what is unique to canada is that notwithstanding this turbulence canadians pay the second lowest price in the western world for petroleum fuels

8363678 they are wholly disinterested in church life often passionately so stirring worship music wont attract them because worship isnt even on their radar screen more comfortable pews cannot compete with the easy chair or the bed that already serve the unchurched person well church events cannot effectively compete with what the world has to offer the only thing the church can provide that no one else has is a life changing practical encounter and on going relationship with the living god and with people transformed by similar encounters until such a connection is made focusing on features programs and benefits other than such a life shaping encounter is more likely to lose ground than to gain it
8363679 millions of young adults are more interested in truth authenticity experiences relationships and spirituality than they are in laws traditions events disciplines institutions and religion the confluence of preconceived notions past experiences and evolving lifestyles and values means that existing churches simply cannot reach millions of todays unchurched people the rapidly swelling numbers of unchurched people may be forcing existing churches to reinvent their core spiritual practices while holding tightly to their core spiritual beliefs it will take radically new settings and experiences to effectively introduce unchurched individuals to biblical principles and practices

8363718 at a time when water is becoming scarce in many parts of the world its economic development stirs up substantial opposition however though some people fear harmful exploitation or even the drying up of our water resources it is urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8363719 were concerned about that we know theres pressure from the u s to export canadas water but we see water as a human right and a public resource
8363720 we dont want to see water commodified and commercialized in this manner
8363721 they see it as an economic opportunity and clearly the motivation here is profit

8363762 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8363763 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
8363764 when hurt will not heal exploring the capacity to relive social and physical pain
8363765 its all about the science of spiritual healing an ideal path towards achieving a peaceful and stable existence
8363766 the basic purpose of the spiritual healing process is to give a perspective on how one should lead his or her life especially the way one goes about doing things in day to day life
8363767 if one is committed to a cause it is not difficult to find time in any case i am not the only one from the tinsel world to be associated with social activities a lot of celebrities are involved in charity work or associated with a social cause but do not talk about it

8363769 ive known hemaji as a wonderful person and if she says sherlyn is promoting nudity on her name i dare not contest her opinion after all the video did receive 19 cuts from the censor board if sherlyn has a diva like image she cant help it you cant ask a madonna to be like an alka yagnik can you
8363770 see sherlyn made this video as a tribute to hemajis

8363793 maam youre going to need to come to the campus and fill out a legal change of name form
8363794 we had the broader foreclosure crisis and housing crisis i think that sort of awoke the larger affordable housing crisis to the rest of america not just for the effect on extremely low income households but a broader sense throughout the country
8363795 they the campaign have been working on it since pretty much 2000
8363796 the coalition was founded to make sure the lowest income people werent on the street and had a voice for federal housing assistance
8363797 housing generally as an issue was enjoying a boom for many years
8363798 the fact there was an affordable housing crunch i dont think it was on too many peoples radars but when the crisis started affecting other people thats when other people started to pay attention to the problem
8363799 our focus has been around the state trust fund in alabama hopefully having a national housing trust fund would make it easier for people to understand the need for a trust fund in our state
8363800 we have gotten a lot done in our state legislature creating a housing trust fund task force and trying to see what a trust fund might look like in the state
8363801 we went and presented to all of our legislators in washington about the need and benefits of a national housing trust fund and how it would be used we talked about our own trust fund in north carolina where the money may end up
8363802 we got congressional staff to tour housing developments to see what had been done we did a lot of work with our local members held statewide conference calls to get them to contact their representatives and talk about housing in their communities
8363803 we did a call to action when there were critical votes in the house and senate
8363804 yes i smacked my children but ive never hit them yes i smacked other peoples children but i never hit them but we are not allowed to do that any more in this pc world
8363805 in the evenings we went to the rugby parties with the kids who slept in the back of the car we cant do that any more because we havent got rid of the perpetrators that actually destroy our society
8363806 it is difficult for us to take appropriate action if we do not know the identity of the culprits therefore we urge the public to come forward and provide us with information so we can act on it my department is proactive and we do act on complaints but we need details
8363807 there is a growing consensus in government that those who run websites and blogs should be held accountable and this means that laws should be used to take action against those who defame and spread disinformation
8363808 if not we are going to have a situation where everyone will be free to make all sorts of allegations with no downside at all
8363809 said a senior government official familiar with details of the meeting
8363810 what we were really interested in seeing in victoria is whether as you went down deeper which takes you back farther in time there could be a systematic change in the trace chemistry of the rocks
8363811 if we did have a wheel failure it would be difficult to impossible to get back out of the crater
8363812 we were having a hard time making progress anyway and the scientific goal was interesting but not something worth risking the mission over so we decided it was time to pack our bags
8363813 well probably be out by the end of the week
8363814 some are meteorites and others are ejecta from impacts into the local meridiani plains
8363815 this will give us insights into other places than were sitting on right now either deeper or off in the distance somewhere

8363837 the nations poverty rate held steady as median household income edged upward last year according to annual census data released yesterday
8363838 the drop was the result of growth in government sponsored health insurance programs officials said most of them focused on children
8363839 the number of people without health insurance fell by more than 1 million in 2007 the first annual decline since the bush administration took office the census bureau reported tuesday incomes edged up for the middle class while poverty held steady

8363879 is designed to deliver up to a two fold iop performance increase over the current generation ds4800 offerings and represents the seventh generation architecture within the midrange disk family
8363880 a design feature of the architecture is to allow for an increase in the number of host ports over time as well as add or change host port types as higher speed host ports or new industry standards based protocol host port types are introduced

8363888 we dont see porting a traditional pc rts to console as a very good strategy because the controls by definition are incompatible with the game design

8363894 i will not speed up my life for anything anybody else or no amount of money
8363895 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point

8363905 a lot of artists dont fit a particular lane music had gotten so wack either you were pop or a rapper or a rock band now everythings merging this period is creating future legends who dont fit kanye lil wayne gym class heroes and thats the secret to their success
8363906 it looks like a scene from this is spinal tap
8363907 you can trust me i believe in the same principles that you do that have been handed down to us over millenia from the people who invented this style
8363908 it looks like theres something alive in there maybe it feeds on the fungus or maybe it doesnt
8363909 anything to detect ibben any spiders im suspicious that these darkened halls are filled with predators
8363910 you may be right i do not like the looks of this
8363911 we may be better served to avoid this area and risk the lit areas and the downwards shaft
8363912 that shaft we just passed looks to be in working order too i was hoping we might find another less conspicuous way down however i am still for proceeding onwards
8363913 lets fan out with the torches but dont get under the webs the last thing we need is radioactive spider bites
8363914 let us go on but carefully i have a bad feeling about this
8363915 query perhaps i should go first due to the possible health dangers
8363916 observation there appears to be no predators here at this time
8363917 one ensemble cast is great because i be able to instruct so many erotica

8363923 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8363924 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8363925 the office of the commissioner has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary
8363926 in fact the contract between the kansas city royals and eric hosmer another boras client was submitted to the office of the commissioner after our contract with pedro was submitted
8363927 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8363928 despite our disappointment we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8363929 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates

8363931 i am happy to announce the signing of joe sakic to a one year contract
8363932 our entire organization is very excited to have joe back for another season as the only captain of the avalanche his record of achievement speaks for itself having him return is great for our franchise and community but also for the game of hockey
8363933 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8363934 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8363935 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there

8363937 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer
8363938 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long

8363941 want to know what sports blogging can look like when its in the hands of a real journalist
8363942 maybe you need to buy a gift for a loved one without ruining the surprise
8363943 maybe youre at an internet kiosk and dont want the next person using it to know at which web site you bank
8363944 the most likely situation is the obvious one nudge nudge wink wink say no more
8363945 the enterprise is more concerned with keeping user information guarded from untrusted web sites than making sure your off business internet habits are kept secret
8363946 the features so far described by microsoft seem to fall more squarely into the paranoid spouse category aka what has been coined porn mode
8363947 if you happen to browse to sites that refer to the same third party resource i e a script image stylesheet information is sent to that third party
8363948 over time the third party can create a profile of which web sites you go to what links you click on etc
8363949 historically microsoft has done a good job of giving enterprise security teams a fair amount of configuration control of applications from within
8363950 essentially if written policy states that all browsing history is kept then more than likely the enterprise will be given the ability to disable the inprivate mode

8363953 the fire bright shade of orange hillary picked to wear tonight must lie directly across the color wheel from the particular shade of punched up blue that flanked the dnc podium the contrast couldnt have been sharper
8363954 you can check out any time you like but you can never leave

8363959 in case you find yourself out in metric land here are the conversions
8363960 senator clintons supporters are rightly proud of her candidacy set aside the controversies of her husbands presidency she has become one of her partys most important figures in the presidential race she vanquished several distinguished opponents including senator joe biden who is now senator obamas running mate and clinton lost the nomination by the narrowest of margins rather than blame senator obama the media or misogynists for her loss clinton supporters should celebrate her accomplishments the glass ceiling doesnt just have 18 million cracks as she has said it has been shattered the next woman to run for president in either party will be doing nothing out of the ordinary
8363961 how then should senators obama and mccain appeal to former clinton supporters and women voters in general the answer is not and never was to put a woman on the ticket the candidates need to talk to women about issues and not just womens issues whatever that means as we say at the independent womens forum all issues are womens issues women are affected by questions of war and peace economic turmoil education and more indeed thats why senator obama carried a majority of the votes of democratic women in more than a dozen states most women want the best candidate not the best female candidate when the fall campaign begins in earnest in september both candidates need to explain what they will do to encourage economic growth reduce consumer uncertainty and revive confidence in the financial system should government get out of the way or play a bigger role what financial institutions if any should be bailed out by government what if anything should be done about the housing market thankfully energy prices have begun to dip but the burden on families especially those of modest means remains enormous how do we increase the supply of energy and how do we do that while protecting the environment
8363962 there is no womens position on any of these issues my bias is towards the private sector and away from heavy handed government programs other women will disagree with me but all of us want to hear the candidates talk about the important issues i disagree with senator clinton on many issues but nevertheless admire her intelligence and her tenacious fight for the democratic presidential nomination the best way to honor her however is not for the candidates to make special appeals to women instead they should appeal to the american people more than half of whom happen to be women

8364000 la operaci n me rompi porque ven a jugando muy bien era el 11 del mundo y el 6 de la race y fue un palo pero las cosas vienen as y ahora tengo que tratar recuperar el nivel de principio de la temporada

8364002 tambi n me quedo con que la actitud ha sido positiva y con el juego de derecha que ha sido agresivo y he conseguido restar bien y eso me ha permitido la victoria

8364017 i have worked hard in the general assembly to develop a good voting record on agriculture and a strong relationship with the farm bureau
8364018 i am gratified the farm bureau appreciates my record of being an effective advocate for farmers
8364019 i am determined to successfully advocate on behalf of the economic interests of my district and with agriculture being the number one industry here that certainly requires fully understanding the concerns of farmers
8364020 we cannot take the prosperity and competitiveness of our farmers for granted
8364021 our government needs to be pro active in ensuring adequate markets for agricultural commodities efficient transportation for those commodities providing a secure and stable energy supply along with low taxes and reasonable rewards for hard work
8364022 aaron recognizes that agriculture represents the largest industry in the 18th district he supports making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent understands the importance of farm programs and trade and will vote to expand domestic supplies of energy including renewable fuels

8364041 se ha hecho un buen trabajo a los resultados no les doy importancia porque en una pretemporada se juegan unos partidos con m s carga y otros con menos lo que se busca es estar bien para el inicio de liga y creo que lo vamos a estar
8364042 el a o pasado el equipo se asent y se hicieron las cosas bien en ese tramo estando a ese nivel se puede optar a hacer algo importante eso lo ir marcando el propio campeonato pero hay que ir con paciencia y paso a paso

8364047 la pretemporada ha sido buena y despu s si que es verdad que se perdi aunque la imagen del equipo tampoco fue mala tuvimos ocasiones de gol tenemos una media de gol alta y puede ser que tengas un partido malo puede servir como toque de atenci n
8364048 el equipo no estuvo mal fallamos en una jugada a bal n parado creo que en muchos partidos ser as y los rivales nos buscar n hacer da o en ese sentido
8364049 el real madrid tiene un gran equipo son los campeones y se merecen todo nuestro respeto y fichen o no son candidatos al t tulo
8364050 el madrid es uno de los favoritos porque es el campe n y luego siempre tiene muy buen equipo nadie duda de eso
8364051 es un jugador important simo uno de los mejores del mundo y es una suerte tenerlo pero tampoco hay que darle todo la responsabilidad

8364053 it shows a strong focus on long term sustainability not to mention a more aesthetic use of the space

8364055 i think that it is worthwhile to evaluate using space in the new development for a student operated business venture
8364056 in my opinion such a space should become part of existing entrepreneurial programs

8364069 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way

8364072 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8364073 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8364074 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8364075 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play

8364077 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8364078 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8364079 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8364080 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8364081 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys

8364101 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8364102 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8364103 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8364104 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8364105 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8364106 now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

8364111 i think its a small minority of people who are pushing this lawsuit why doesnt the wendt foundation spend the money its spending on this lawsuit by helping hunters hope or studio arena or some other worthy charity
8364112 theres never been a vote taken on whether the public wants this casino

8364114 i just want to get the business sold pay all the bills and move on with my life
8364115 i dared our people both individually and as a church to move from an attractional model of ministry to a missional model
8364116 a body of people sent on a mission who gather for worship encouragement and teaching from the word that supplement what they are feeding themselves throughout the week

8364120 ive never heard that from anybody i do not plan on moving in weight class or organization im happy with where im at
8364121 at the same time thats what keeps me motivated to train harder and harder if you have easy fights its kind of hard to push yourself the more you get challenged the more you challenge yourself in the gym
8364122 i just think it comes down to the way i am and the way i compete even before i was part of the ufc
8364123 and as soon as i became a part of the ufc i made sure my manager told them straight up and down i want to fight stiff competition the more challenges i have the better

8364132 i cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent god would have designedly created parasitic wasps with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars
8364133 their surveys revealed that of all scientists questioned 39 3 percent professed belief in a personal god about the same as in the 1914 study however among elite scientists now defined as members of the national academy of sciences the proportion who were believers had plummeted to 7 percent with biologists showing the least religious conviction at 5 5 percent in the general population of the united states some 86 percent profess belief in the existence of a personal god according to a 1999 gallup poll
8364134 concerning biological evolution the church does not have an official position on whether various life forms developed over the course of time however it says that if they did develop then they did so under the impetus and guidance of god and their ultimate creation must be ascribed to him

8364136 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8364137 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8364138 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8364139 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8364140 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8364141 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol

8364144 by working with pro formance to conduct validation testing ford is proving that eco driving techniques are teachable and work across a broad spectrum of vehicles and drivers
8364145 its a great initiative for ford to lead in this country its not the end all solution for america to obtain energy independence but it is an important part of it
8364146 we are talking with fleet owners first because they have large numbers of vehicles and drivers that could realize significant benefit from such training
8364147 ultimately all drivers can benefit from practicing eco driving and one day it may be considered mandatory as part of all new drivers training

8364229 our closest lab is los angeles when we sold in the pacific northwest we were competing against a strong local high quality competitor
8364230 westcon is almost a mini transcat it matches transcats culture

8364232 so what well end up with is a product distribution point in portland which will serve the western states rather than taking five to seven days to ship something from rochester to la it will only take a day or two that has a tremendous upside for us in terms of growing our share in that marketplace
8364233 alternative energy is a hot topic in the u s today and westcon has broken into the wind energy market with a key wind supplier
8364234 from what weve seen its going to be a significant market independent studies have told us that the u s is the number one market for wind energy over the next five years

8364252 and now what have kyle and carl won seven out of nine its pretty easy to be under the radar with those two guys
8364253 if we tried to do something different from what weve done in other years in the chase just because this is our last year with gibbs that would mean we werent giving 100 percent those previous years
8364254 it really doesnt feel different were all still doing everything we can to try to win we just arent good enough to beat those two guys right now and we have to find something soon the clock is ticking
8364255 theres just something that kyle and carl know or have figured out with the car of tomorrow that some of the rest of us havent

8364301 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8364302 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8364303 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8364304 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8364305 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families

8364331 nel mondo esistono due tipologie di donne quelle che simulano a letto e quelle che non fanno sesso

8364336 your not gonna believe this but the brake pedal is lying on the floor it fell off dude
8364337 good guy he stays in resorts and stuff like that on race weekend wish i could afford that kind of lifestyle
8364338 tony will at times do or say things that make our skin crawl
8364339 we realized he was exactly the wrong breed to have as a pet
8364340 drivers never held back in the old days they said whatever came to mind you never knew what junior johnson was going to say but if he says it you know he believes it tonys like that i dont want our guys to be vanilla we need different flavors
8364341 running a cup team is a big step for me
8364342 but not too big i mean i worked my way up the ladder plus i already own a couple of race teams i got an edge
8364343 i tore around in my back yard with that and when i turned eight i was old enough to drive racing carts
8364344 i was racing again the next week young and dumb
8364345 my parents mortgaged their house so that i could go go cart racing
8364346 one day in february of 91 i ran second in a race in arizona and my portion of the prize money was 3 500
8364347 well i was making 5 an hour at the machine shop and i thought how many hours do i have to work to make what i make in one day driving a race car
8364348 we climbed a ladder one rung at a time nothing too soon
8364349 the greatest race car driver ive watched in this era
8364350 you know those kids in high school that talk all the time and wont shut up
8364351 and every once in a while someone gives them a good wailing thats kurt
8364352 we knew if we were at the same racetrack wed have to beat each other to win and we just got in a shoving match in race cars every time one of us would hit the other it was harder than the one before eventually kenny crashed me bad enough to where i couldnt get it to move
8364353 i reached in his car and tried to grab hold of him
8364354 wasnt a very smart thing to do the funny thing is dale earnhardt was in front of kennys car and earnhardt slows down to a crawl to give me time to get to kenny so the old man was working with me there
8364355 sometimes i just want to shake some damn sense into him
8364356 but tonys a good guy i would say that if he got in shape hed win even more races but i dont think tony needs to do that to win
8364357 i like to think i do things the right way
8364358 its about respect you get into a wreck with somebody you might hold a grudge for three or four weeks but it goes away theres a lot of water under the bridge
8364359 well be taking pictures and hanging out and all sorts of stuff
8364360 a little heartland a little misbehaving and a little book of revelations
8364361 what in the hell does this guy have his brights on for

8364365 money and race cars thats pretty much all i care about
8364366 shit you cant blame junior even if its his fault

8364374 theres a lot he can do at the convention to prove his respect for both clintons that would be very very welcome
8364375 if that were done it would be inevitable that millions of people would support obama with time money and votes

8364382 they want to know about my culture thats very satisfying to me twenty years ago this would not be possible twenty years ago italians tried to sing in english sing the blues maybe that was a good thing but you can be authentic when you realize your roots thats what b b king janis joplin aretha franklin did
8364383 i dont want to lose whats mine but i want to contaminate my roots

8364391 its a guy who was excavated from a high chilean mountain cliff there were some crowns and hoards of jewelry found around him so it can be assumed he was once a great king im sure that person did not think they would end up on a stills record in 2008
8364392 it was cool because we found out he was a fan of the band
8364393 when we first met him he was chatting to me about stuff that wed done and he knew a lot about us which was really flattering as we were big fans of his obviously
8364394 it was just one of those things where it was like do you just wanna play some stuff and see how it goes just for fun and it was good
8364395 its this weird coincidence that he happens to live part of the time where i live and part of the time where my brothers live so its not bad really it works quite well
8364396 none of them are exactly finished because the idea was we were always practicing like lets finish these songs but we end up writing new ones so we never finishing them its more fun to write new stuff
8364397 johnny was saying when i used to see the ramones i used to be like its really cool but all of them should be singing so johnny was like i wanna have a mic i wanna do some backing vocals thats what i mean hes totally part of it its dead exciting it doesnt feel like a guest weve just got a new member
8364398 well i love you so much and its all i could do just to keep myself from telling you that i never felt so alone before
8364399 i was bummed that i wasnt going to get to see rage i grew up in spain and i saw them a bunch of times in the 90s when i was a kid
8364400 they were a huge influence on me musically and politically they made people question things and made people talk about how f ed up america and europes foreign policy is theyre just a massively influential band on many different levels
8364401 i walked past tom morello at a festival in sweden but he was in the middle of a heated ping pong game
8364402 he seemed pretty into it but yeah i wanted to do the whole hi youre my hero but it just wasnt the moment

8364406 if anything performing has hindered my songwriting because im used to writing on my own pace at my leisure or while im supposed to be working a proper job i dont really have time to sit down when im not performing im usually really tired and just want to sleep
8364407 theyve lost the plot i dont get it anymore what theyre doing now i dont think is very good
8364408 as we continue to hear more bad economic news we will continue to see bankruptcies spiral upwards
8364409 the main difference between environment day and conservation day is that we are no longer accepting tires wood waste and scrap metal
8364410 these were never popular drop off items at environment day events and eliminating these items allows us to run a more efficient event for less cost

8364413 the fact of the matter is zamoyski created these works and never assigned the copyright to anyone
8364414 by law the creator retains the copyright unless he assigns it

8364418 while democrats are meeting inside this convention hall there are plenty of parties going on outside
8364419 corporations union officials and lobbyists are throwing parties morning noon and night all to win the influence of members of congress who are here in great number despite a law designed to stick a fork in lobbyist activities at these conventions they have found new ways to spoon feed their powerful friends
8364420 even the emotional speech by sen ted kennedy did not stop the festivities the bankers jazz band kept playing and the waiters serving for many this is the real business of the convention one of the scores of parties to honor key democrats who control legislation directly affecting top corporations but bankers were not happy to see abc news arrive
8364421 its ethics reform with a very big wink and a nod from the democratic partys top elected officials
8364422 behind this stigmatization of lobbyists is the notion that the failure to produce legislation in the public interest stems from the existence of lobbyists
8364423 which is obviously nonsense we couldnt abolish lobbying without repealing the first amendment which gives all of us even those who are paid to do it the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances and the government could not sensibly do business without lobbyists

8364427 weve usually been pretty strong on that type of track and weve had some success there before so coming off of a disappointing weekend at bristol its definitely good to be going to a track you feel you can run well at

8364437 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8364438 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8364439 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8364440 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8364441 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8364442 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8364443 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8364444 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8364445 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8364446 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8364447 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8364448 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8364449 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8364450 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8364451 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8364452 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8364453 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8364454 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8364455 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8364456 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8364457 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8364458 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8364459 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8364460 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8364461 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state

8364498 didnt ever feel like i lost the job i think thats a bad way to look at it i want to go in for the win and not to lose

8364507 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8364508 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8364509 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8364510 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8364511 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8364512 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all

8364516 lets say he is as far away from us as the planet pluto which if youve read in the last few years the astronomers have now declassified and i think historians will one day declassify george bush as a president because he was never really elected

8364543 the obamas found a way to send their kids to private school i cant do it my kids are top students theyre good kids i want the choice i want the opportunity
8364544 everybody in the pepsi center buzzing last night about hillary clintons prime time speech so did she accomplish what she set out to do
8364545 she knew what she had to do and i think in many respects she delivered beyond expectations certainly the news media had ramped up this so called rift between the two camps which was just not the case and i think she really hit it out of the park last night
8364546 although we didnt make this up i mean there was a sort of a sense from her a little holding back and she certainly was reluctant to get out of the race when it was clear that she was really wasnt going to get the nomination so that was real
8364547 you saw her really kind of take the gloves off last night diplomatically with senator mccain
8364548 you know what though the criticism then that has come subsequently because there will always be criticism was well she didnt really address her issue with barack obama which was he doesnt have the experience is that was there a way for her to do that or she chose not to do that
8364549 hillary clinton stands and delivers what a speech last night if you appreciate stagecraft at any level you had to say she did a good job with that
8364550 and the drama is coming to a crescendo of course as everyone awaits barack obama to accept the nomination of the democratic party in front of 75 000 people in an open football stadium its going to be remarkable
8364551 yeah harry is like a kid in a candy store with his political fix out there

8364553 on this day in 1919 the republican controlled u s house of representatives passed the 19th amendment according women the right to vote while 85 of republicans voted in favor nearly half the democrats voted against womens suffrage
8364554 m ost prevalent theme during tuesday nights coverage of the democratic national convention after speculation over healing the clinton obama feud
8364555 tv journalists worrying about how the democrats are not adequately aggressive in their attacks against john mccain as reporters
8364556 the veep also ran took the podium with a delivery as flat as kansas and no apparent training on a teleprompter she offered a mild mannered monotone attack on john mccain his multiple homes his bush connections and some general platitudes about barack obama and change
8364557 he made some brief passable efforts to paint john mccain as four more years of george bush and excite the audience with the promises of an obama administration but his efforts at bipartisanship were confusing his specifics irritatingly vague his style bland and his speech meandering
8364558 finally finally got the crowd going with some snappy clever specific attacks on john mccain hitting the republican nominee for his political and professional failures wrapped in his personal foibles and frailties out of touch stuck in the past
8364559 he threw some daggers at the republicans including a pointed katrina remark but quickly moved on to a mature argument for hard work and partisanship with purpose
8364560 a folksy tough funny home run of a speech opened by gliding down the path of chatting up his own state and relating his own history but he soon turned to some carefully detailed specific attacks on john mccain that were cheery casual confident and ultimately roof raising
8364561 she had some clever anti bush and anti mccain lines and explained that her friend john mccain is not the person to lead the country into the future insisting all americans must come together to elect obama the camera also captured a teary eyed ruddy bill clinton who could be seen apparently saying i love you i love you forever when she took the stage and clearly relished the speech throughout
8364562 looking sleek elegant and composed she spoke with clarity and warmth about both obama and her uncle ted kennedy linking the democratic presumptive nominee with her legendary family
8364563 the ailing political lion electrified the hall with a strong passionate speech
8364564 gave a relaxed and sweet overview of michelle obamas life from a personal perspective
8364565 a cheerful personal speech it seemed to fall a bit flat and wasnt as focused an attack as will likely be required to achieve the message goals the party has in denver
8364566 offered an argument for bipartisan harmony as a republican supporter of obama
8364567 in a slim turquoise dress by her favorite chicago based designer she glowed while she spoke affectionately of her devoted hard working parents her love for her husband and the issues facing the country there were brief but heartfelt nods to womens suffrage martin luther king public servants soldiers joe biden and most conspicuously hillary clinton but she generally kept things light and cozy as the crowd went wild for her every smile and sigh and her mother proudly looked on

8364575 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8364576 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8364577 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8364578 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8364594 sept 11 motivated the united states to behave really differently in the world
8364595 that is to say americans realized that even in their homes they could not feel safe they had to protect their interests outside the boundaries of the u s for russia it is the same thing we were sitting in our homes the national discussion was internal now this georgian attack is perceived as aggression and made us realize that we cannot stay home we have to go outside our homes to protect ourselves on new frontiers

8364602 because of past complaints that this was a puppy mill we contacted other agencies before going onto the property
8364603 we were removing animals from 12 30 to 7 30 p m saturday and we were working sunday from 7 a m to 5 15 p m

8364605 ive been in meth labs that smelled better not good
8364606 but the condition of the dogs was the red flag more than the fact that she couldnt document their lineage
8364607 the batch we saw before probably had the worst teeth weve ever seen one dog had to have its entire lower jaw removed hes still ticking though hes about 17 now
8364608 to undertake a project like this the logistics are huge
8364609 its very expensive the rescue and the investigation once you enter into this project you have to follow through
8364610 they are hard to housebreak and often theyre not good with children especially dogs that have been abused or have never had human contact when we place these dogs we look at references we check with your vet and even do a home visit to make sure that youre not running a puppy mill yourself and that youre prepared for a dog we want their next home to be their forever home

8364664 and if he wants to pound it ill call the pound it plays
8364665 i spend a number of hours primarily doing the same thing in which ive been doing over the last several years
8364666 however i spend a little bit more late nights instead of going home at 10 00 10 30 i may stay until 12 30 or 1 00 because of thoughts that come up and different things to discuss with the offensive staff different things to pass by coach weis when he gets in
8364667 i think what coach weis is really saying is that we have an offensive line who is a lot bigger and stronger
8364668 we have multiple backs that are running a lot better than theyve run in the past years so it creates an opportunity now for us to run the ball a little bit more effective in which weve run over the past several years
8364669 were creating an identity by being able to run the football play action pass dropback pass but the most important thing in which were doing is that were teaching guys football were teaching guys situational football
8364670 were teaching them to stay on schedule the importance of down and distance red zone football coming out football taking shots were basically doing a lot more because weve had a lot more time also in which were spending on teaching football
8364671 these guys have really got significantly better in the offseason the spring was really important for some of the new things that we added offensively and some of the things in which we simplified it gave each individual an opportunity to consistently run the plays over and over again against various defensive fronts various blitzes various coverages so they understand where the reads are and understanding where the free defenders are i think each one of them has improved significantly since last fall

8364762 more individual u s athletes will carry home gold medals around their neck than any other nation if you want to count it that way
8364763 this is a mans world but it wouldnt be nothing without a woman or a girl
8364764 how are you going to go anywhere acting like that
8364765 i have a bomb 100 50 20 and make it fast
8364766 its for humanitarian aid and economic aid its emergency assistance georgia has experienced a serious loss of infrastructure road and bridges
8364767 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military
8364768 right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
8364769 the danger is letting the russians think they can get away with this and do it again in ukraine or someplace else they have to realize that theyre not going to get a free ride
8364770 its physically impossible for us to do enough to deter the russians from further incursions so its not clear to me that military aid would be appreciably more than symbolic
8364771 its hard to imagine that the united states would embark on the process of rearming georgia until the conflict has reached a stable equilibrium that at least has the possibility of triggering some kind of military confrontation between the u s and russia
8364772 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8364773 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8364774 informed his chinese colleague about the situation in south ossetia and abkhazia
8364775 china is concerned about the latest development in south ossetia and abkhazia
8364776 the military forces which have not yet pulled back to the lines they held before the hostilities must move without delay
8364777 which aims to unilaterally change the borders of georgia is quite simply unacceptable
8364778 clear commitment from the eu that it will continue to stand by georgia and the same applies for our membership of nato
8364779 we are determined to locate and identify those responsible for this terrible tragedy
8364780 i am confident that in the end we will find those responsible and bring closure for the harmon family
8364781 he served in uniform with honor and distinction we owe him gratitude for that
8364782 but we dont owe him our vote because the stakes are too high
8364783 what have i missed is meet joe black on about peanut butter again that man is positively obsessed
8364784 ooh is this the part where meet joe black talks all jamaican for no reason fantastic
8364785 underfed pretty blue blood girl whose nonthreatening looks and quiet read boring grace cause an undead man to fall for her like its hard or something
8364786 half beasts that look like orcs in the sense that the seven year old who comes to your house at halloween looks like batman
8364787 clavicles to another f list leading man in need toby keith yes you read that right claire forlani is the leading woman in the racist redneck propaganda film
8364788 the inability to act ones way out of a paper sack
8364789 shes so brilliant omg shes ahead of her time omg shes a classic beauty omg
8364790 ya look like that girl from the parent trap you do
8364791 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
8364792 matt what if i have big spending clients are they allowed in
8364793 would you go to the movies with them if not no
8364794 cooking eggs is really a question of temperature not time
8364795 i use an oven in the lab its easier but if the oven in your kitchen is not accurate cook eggs in plenty of water using a good thermometer
8364796 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8364797 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8364798 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8364799 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8364800 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8364801 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8364802 pedro alvarez never received a contract from the pittsburgh pirates
8364803 were awaiting the determination of a grievance filed by the union against the commissioners office
8364804 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8364805 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8364806 its time for the pittsburgh pirates and mr coonelly to come clean with pittsburgh fans regarding their dealings with pedro alvarez
8364807 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8364808 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8364809 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8364810 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8364811 for their investigations on the fermentation of sugar and fermentative enzymes
8364812 when i learn something new and it happens every day i feel a little more at home in this universe a little more comfortable in the nest
8364813 these changes are what teachers and parents have been asking for
8364814 they will make our accountability system more practical for educators more effective for schools and more useful to parents
8364815 i think an assessment is needed to measure the progress students have made
8364816 my hope is that this new test will give us more diagnostic information on the student
8364817 its my hope that we will be able to use this new assessment to better serve the needs of our students
8364818 n s estamos muito entusiasmados com a vinda do jorge para saint louis ele nos traz conhecimento em abund ncia e um dos treinadores mais requisitados do momento

8364820 represents the state of the art in environmental protection in terms of transportation alternative energy production and sustainable construction techniques
8364821 the law was amended to permit vauban residents to live car free without the expense of building an unnecessary parking space
8364822 gecko smart para transit is intended to be part of an overall transportation system walking and bicycling would be more desirable forms of transportation that vans and buses
8364823 id like to agree with you susan but it may have to be if people are unwilling to support raising more money for transportation spending increased gas tax for example
8364824 okay im convinced in the end i find dot pretty good about presenting to community boards even if they dont have to granted its often a briefing on
8364825 andy b actually i tried the lane again last night and people be looking down like at their feet thats why i think british style markings on the ground would work also
8364826 we hope that this will resonate with americans concerned with election issues and with mexicans concerned with issues in their country
8364827 i am hoping that the documentary will motivate people to vote
8364828 the ryder cup has brought the best out of me everybody tells me why dont you just play the way you play in the ryder cup
8364829 as tom lehman said in america wed be delighted if monty is not playing
8364830 to get selected i think ive got to show some form i havent become a bad player im just sort of out of form and have been for the last month
8364831 but i feel very much more confident having had a weeks holiday away from the game and after practising here last week
8364832 hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential or otherwise everybody here and im sure that i speak for the captain as well understands my love for the ryder cup and thats how i will be remembered if you like
8364833 theres no resignation in any way shape or form i just felt i wanted to turn my game around and the best way to do that was practise up here and prepare the way that i have
8364834 im still five short but we will see thats what i was doing yesterday trying to find launch angles and all kind of fancy technical stuff that ive never been into before
8364835 i played well last week and i need to do the same again this week
8364836 if that warrants me or merits me a pick then fantastic
8364837 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify
8364838 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger
8364839 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while but it would have been nice for him to have played here
8364840 you might have thought he would have known that before he either entered here or pulled out of here
8364841 it was an oral order given by the judges yesterday tuesday at the audience
8364842 the trial is adjourned awaiting a decision of the appeals chamber
8364843 substantially and persistently obstructing the proceedings of this trial both in and out of court
8364844 platform to espouse his political agenda and to intimidate witnesses
8364845 sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8364846 how much money and time is it going to take to run an effective and successful business that will earn a good profit
8364847 this trip took place last thursday and she has gone to the united states on a personal visit
8364848 these are all rumours and her trip proves these rumours wrong
8364849 how can john mccain understand ordinary folks when he lives in multiple houses
8364850 rising gas prices leading edge technology and the push for work life flexibility have all come together in the past twelve months to create a pretty dramatic increase in telework across the u s and canada
8364851 well i think its pretty important and in particular when you take a place like montana where a democrat hasnt gotten 50 running for president since lyndon baines johnson and you know that barack obama and john mccain are tied right now and in places like colorado new mexico and nevada who knows mccain may lose arizona they know him down there you know
8364852 energy absolutely energy you know these national press people they apparently think that americans dont pay attention we still remember that gas was 1 75 a gallon when the oil men seized power in the white house and now its up to 4 00 a gallon that is effectively the largest tax increase on the middle class in america in history and people know that they know that theyre hurting and they know that we cant drill our way to energy independence
8364853 im from montana where we think gun control is hittin what youre aimin at
8364854 the presently accepted regenerative medicine idea is that you make a stem cell from a patient bring it back to the beginning as it were then you are left with the problem of how to instruct that cell to become a beta cell or a motor neuron
8364855 we asked the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning could you go from one cell type to another
8364856 up to this time we hadnt demonstrated that you could do direct reprogramming
8364857 one present treatment for some diabetics is to transplant islets into the liver so we know that liver cells are a reasonable home for beta cells
8364858 if were lucky in two to five years we can think about doing that in people
8364859 if we physically inject something into the pancreas it almost always induces pancreatitis
8364860 you could be causing more trouble than what you started with
8364861 maybe when the history of the whole subject is written it will be possible to say which was the best idea
8364862 i cant emphasize enough at this point that were too ignorant to know what is the best way to treat patients and until we know that it is essential that we use embryonic stem cells and ips cells to teach us about the mechanisms of disease until we know how to succeed we have to aggressively pursue all avenues
8364863 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
8364864 no nation in the world takes human rights more seriously than the united states
8364865 the policies of our country comply with our law which prohibits torture were proud of our country and what it stands for we expect all who serve america to conduct themselves with honor and we enforce the rules
8364866 the misdeeds of a few should never be used to slander the good and decent americans who go to work every day to keep our country safe
8364867 that she doesnt say excuse me i bet you she will just walk right into me and ill just stop
8364868 the term is excuse me if you use this term people will get out of your way
8364869 the term is excuse me right did anyone ever teach it to you
8364870 lets just walk right in the middle and when people are coming down with their carts lets just walk directly towards them and see if they say excuse me first

8364878 we are exercising maximum restraint to ensure the civilians are safe we have every apprehension that the terrorists may harm the civilians
8364879 these militants for sure have come with a specific and single point objective of creating communal trouble in jammu
8364880 on its own mapreduce is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis companies that are integrating mapreduce and sql are increasing its applicability and giving developers and dbas the ability to work together on a common parallel data processing infrastructure
8364881 greenplum has seamlessly integrated mapreduce into its database making it possible for us to access our massive dataset with standard sql queries in combination with mapreduce programs
8364882 we are finding this to be incredibly efficient because complex sql queries can be expressed in a few lines of perl or python code
8364883 this adds to our support of sql mysql oracle excel and sql analysis services
8364884 our vision is to bring business intelligence everywhere and to everyone the way to do so is to allow anyone to directly query the data so no additional it effort is required to prepare the data for analysis
8364885 current solutions even if they are easy to use dont go much farther than a simple pivot table or a chart
8364886 one of the key advantages of google spreadsheets is the ability to build a collaborative spreadsheet sisense now takes this ability and adds to it operational business intelligence within a wrokgroup
8364887 its a real good strategic fit and this is going to be a great marketing vehicle for kids
8364888 providing everything is installed correctly all the stockparts should be fine as you are not over clocking
8364889 of course thats the way we keep our costs low
8364890 the computer models are all over the place right now

8364896 i told her id make a deal with her that if we won the gold medal id give it to her she thought i was kidding but i told her i had one already and the way they treated us at the wynn it was the least i could do
8364897 sara see what i could do if i had a fisheye
8364898 these denominations once fueled the great missionary movement that carried the gospel to the ends of the earth
8364899 the primary injury caused by mainline protestant decline is not social but spiritual
8364900 committed to a radical doctrinal relativism these denominations have served as poster children for virtually every theological fad and liberal proposal imaginable
8364901 only the biblical gospel will ever have any impact on the world around us
8364902 but what does it matter the important thing is that in whether from false motives or true christ is preached and because of this i rejoice
8364903 what ive told you will happen at the end of the age
8364904 the good news is that now we can live godly
8364905 the good news is not that we can now live godly lives

8364916 it is a very serious crime to threaten a presidential candidate
8364917 in this case however there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama

8364924 thereve been people hurt by backing out of the stall with a loaded gun and firing at a target
8364925 take a pencil or a dowel to make sure theres not a round lodged in the barrel

8364937 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8364938 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost

8364943 i think the city manager said it best when she said that i was chosen not because of my gender but because of my experience
8364944 while it is noteworthy that chief chambers is the first woman to lead the henderson police department she was chosen because she possesses the ability to lead the growing police department along with her already proven dedication to the citizens of this community
8364945 i have seen first hand her leadership abilities and am confident the henderson police department is in very good hands
8364946 the people the employees that work here are the strength
8364947 they are very professional they are dedicated they love what they do and they work hard to keep this community safe
8364948 gold medal athletes in the olympics will still have ways that they can tweak their performance and do better

8365213 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8365214 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8365215 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8365216 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8365217 i like watching shows that mean something i like a message i like a moral i like a political view point i want a reflection of the society i am living in yes even if its a timeless classic that can be manipulated into todays current events bring it on im not too interested in sappy content about seduction or how to seduce or talking heads over a pot of tea i like raw poignant gritty in your face here i am here is reality kind of theatre i dont mind my ps and qs in theatre since i dont mind them in my day to day being
8365218 he did it he tried to kill him he wasnt successful
8365219 there but for the grace of god is a murderer
8365220 you know that a crime was committed the question is who committed the crime
8365221 im not saying its a conspiracy but you know what it certainly gives pause and gives a motive
8365222 we are pleased to resolve our outstanding dispute with microsoft and to put this litigation behind us we now have our full attention and focus devoted to working with innovative companies around the world including microsoft to accelerate and rapidly achieve global adoption of our haptic technology in gaming consumer electronics mobility and medical products
8365223 prohibiting it from manufacturing using and selling or importing into the u s the infringing sony play station system including its consoles
8365224 despite the demand to do so immersion has failed to make any payment under the sla service license agreement to microsoft following immersions settlement with sony
8365225 pay microsoft a minimum of 15 million for any amounts received from sony up to 100 0 million plus 25 percent of any amounts over 100 million up to 150 million and 17 5 percent of any amounts over 150 million
8365226 where scores of countries followed the lead to recognize the independence of kosovo
8365227 i wish the help had reached us on time that way at least my children could have been safe
8365228 my child is so ill i cannot do a thing about it i wonder what i did wrong that my child must suffer
8365229 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8365230 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
8365231 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go
8365232 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
8365233 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math
8365234 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
8365235 these kids may have quit at some point but the big thing is a lot of people have quit on them
8365236 its the place to do something fun and a little out of the box
8365237 its the biggest crowd and its what people are talking about i was fortunate to play and win in the audrey hepburn dress
8365238 we are trying to drive some value clothes in simple terms look good longer
8365239 then you use less time shopping less time driving less aggravation overall you would spend less money
8365240 it needs to be tied differently it shouldnt come loose if its tied correctly even after dancing
8365241 if you wear uchikake wedding kimono you must have a wig
8365242 after the wedding you take off the veil and wear a wig white is temple while red means family
8365243 i thought it would give me my american culture but he was a zen monk so i learned those ways of sewing and cooking for him i never really got away from japanese culture
8365244 traditionally a bride would have two kimono for her wedding now there may be as many as four
8365245 it will be my 25th so my family is coming from all over hawaii and okinawa they send me some of the fabric i use
8365246 the fashion shows are always such a draw and were at capacity for each show
8365247 before jerry came along there were only robber barons who were out there running modelling schools
8365248 you guys all had your arms around me in the hospital saying youd take care of her
8365249 given the nature and extent of your injuries it is clear that you are unable to perform the duties required in that position
8365250 i cannot rule out the possibility of ms schuenke returning to work as a firefighter paramedic
8365251 heres somebody who risked her life to try to save the mother of a fire captain in this district and now two years later when all the smoke and dust has cleared theyre going to cut her loose and make her live off social security disability and thats just not fair
8365252 this is what ive always wanted to do with my life
8365253 for ubisoft europe is actually more important than the u s and by more than 5 percent its become a very strong market for us
8365254 now that theres more accessibility some accessories that are helping people to have fun i think this market has no limit in the growth it can have if we can make sure that the people that are coming in are staying
8365255 almost as deep in terms of dollars not liability as the savings and loan crisis
8365256 we need more transparency particularly with regard to hedge funds they are the ones that are causing this thing to go under and theres no transparency no accountability we dont know how deep this problem is
8365257 ive spoken to ian and i dont buy that comment
8365258 ive heard nothing from nick i have not been given any indication which direction hes going with his picks i have no clue what hes doing to do
8365259 its a difficult situation because if he was playing gleneagles this week he would basically give up his chance of winning the fedex cup
8365260 he gives up his chance to win 10 million us dollars 5 6million and the possibility of playing for huge world ranking points
8365261 having said that justin rose has been over there cementing his place in the team hes given up his chance of winning 10 million dollars saying its only money you cant take it with you
8365262 its great to see darren playing well on a personal level and its good from a euro golf standpoint
8365263 for a 200 investment we ve made we got featured in the local newspaper once twice on tv and it s the buzz around town i can t get a quarter page ad for 200
8365264 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
8365265 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
8365266 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
8365267 we cancelled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
8365268 this wasn t a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didn t try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
8365269 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
8365270 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
8365271 if one espouses the belief that the more the number of competitors the lower the price one could assume from that that with this high concentration of refiners in canada that we are paying a higher price at the wholesale level
8365272 while it may be of little consolation to canadians the volatility we have recently witnessed is not unique to canada
8365273 what is unique to canada is that notwithstanding this turbulence canadians pay the second lowest price in the western world for petroleum fuels
8365274 at least 70 per cent of canada s gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8365275 we respectfully call on the political leadership in canada to acknowledge this risk and support u s regulators to increase market oversight
8365276 it defies reason to me that all of this money can be coming into the market with no effect
8365277 like this is all kind of after the fact moving around and not doing something to the underlying price of the thing that s being examined
8365278 anyone with a lot of paper a bank or hedge fund can trade paper
8365279 the paper looks better now that it did three months ago
8365280 weve created a larger news hole and we wanted to make sure we have the kind of content people expect even when the ad edit mix doesnt justify it
8365281 those kinds of comments i thought from a large global company like intel were probably irresponsible considering the platform that they have
8365282 these companies that are working together to serve their mutual customers are also competing with each other
8365283 they have two very different points of view and that leads to conflict they both want to assert the superiority of their technology
8365284 comparing atom and tegra is a little bit like comparing something with a v12 1 000 horsepower to a hybrid
8365285 what the world wants from us in the mobile device space is something like a hybrid
8365286 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8365287 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8365288 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8365289 however any deviation to the left of the forecast track could bring the center of gustav very near jamaica
8365290 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8365291 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8365292 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8365293 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8365294 right now were talking about a tropical storm in haiti
8365295 theres a long way from where it is now to new orleans
8365296 hes housed in the ogle county jail and hes obviously very concerned about the charges and is taking this matter very seriously as he should
8365297 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8365298 ive shut up about this long enough samantha is using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some los angeles dj
8365299 and now shes writing a book i am at my wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are
8365300 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse
8365301 my daughter isnt working because shes always with sam even my ex wife dina lohan knows it she just isnt doing anything about it
8365302 she knows about my christian faith she just wouldnt ask
8365303 being fashionable and environmentally friendly are no longer mutually exclusive
8365304 with forward thinking creativity and a new generation of sustainable fabrics designers have taken green fashion to an entirely new level eco fashion is not a trend but rather a new category we can anticipate seeing a lot more of on the runway
8365305 this campaign brings eco lifestyle mainstream by raising awareness of how making small meaningful changes can have a positive impact on the environment
8365306 to be eco chic not only applies to your wardrobe but also to your state of mind
8365307 we have found that people prefer cleaner safer and more responsible choices when presented with the opportunity we applaud those manufacturers and retailers who are responding to that demand everyone can make a difference by making responsible everyday choices that create a new market
8365308 we have the worst traffic second worst air quality caused by all the diesel trucks in the area
8365309 no one will want to live here the salt the garbage a construction site the rats
8365310 the role of corporate lobbyists and wealthy donors at the convention for a series of money trail reports
8365311 i will always be grateful to everyone from all 50 states puerto rico and the
8365312 theres just loss of your energy and your will so theres an impact on work not being able to work at the capacity i was used to so there were feelings of loss there theres a loss of femininity you know losing your breasts automatically makes you feel less attractive
8365313 were a fast moving society and sometimes you need somebody who will allow you to talk brainstorm so im a big advocate when its appropriate
8365314 every woman needs to know what kind of surgery she had she should know the size of her tumor she should know how many lymph nodes if any were removed she should know her stage she should know if she received chemotherapy what were the names of those drugs and she should know if she had radiation
8365315 the role of corporate lobbyists and wealthy donors at the convention for a series of money trail reports
8365316 i will always be grateful to everyone from all 50 states puerto rico and the
8365317 i think it is important as being a delegate is a representative role that the clinton delegates get an opportunity to cast the vote they were elected to cast
8365318 i know im always telling you slower is faster and be smooth but grow some balls and slide that thing
8365319 you know what you should do just shoot him i mean if he cant read your mind and know that you want to make out or giving hummers or whatever then you should just be able to shoot him dont have a mature conversation and discuss things just shoot him water cannon potato gun paint pellet gun tazer his ass you would like to think that in the 20 000 years or so of human existence that we men would have mastered the art of reading womens minds by now if not then its guantanamo for him maybe he will get his head out of his ass and be able to give you what you want without you being an adult and asking for it every man out there worth a 100 grand bar should be able to size up and provide for anything that a woman wants at any time i mean if we arent tending to your every need then we should be rounded up and shot out of the next space shuttle headed for mars venus or siberia maybe in the next few years scientists will come up with a perfect male that puts all of your needs and wants in life in front of his own i mean we men should be happy you tolerate us at all make him bow before you and kiss your feet he doesnt realize how lucky he is to have you mortimer from down the street kisses your ass like its made out of dark chocolate and hes a total toad loser but at least he gets it that women are the be all end all of life im with ya girl we men dont appreciate what a treasure you are i dont even date anymore because i realize that you women are superior creatures whenever i see a woman i just whip my wallet at your feet credit cards facing you bow to your preternatural presence and get the hell out of the way because a goddess is in my presence
8365320 we are knocking on doors to see if there is interest in tns and we must continue to pursue that
8365321 gfk verein is a 58 per cent shareholder and has very strong views on how gfk should be run
8365322 concluded that the terms of the financing available did not enable a sufficiently compelling alternative cash offer to be made for tns that was also economically in the best interests of the gfk shareholders
8365323 if sir martin sorrell does not seek to engage the management it could be detrimental to the future success of tns tns is a people business and that is what makes it successful
8365324 fizemos um bom primeiro tempo e por isso conseguimos sair na frente acho que houve muito individualismo em certos momentos acabamos desperdi ando algumas oportunidades de ampliar e sofremos a derrota
8365325 one of the things ive never tried to do is exploit my vietnam service to my country because it would be totally inappropriate to do so
8365326 if you can afford it obviously the best thing to do is keep the pool clean if you cant afford it nine times out of 10 we will go ahead and treat the pool if mosquito larvae are present and plant mosquito fish those will last the rest of season and if there is a mild winter and plenty of water sometimes will last longer than that
8365327 before they die they develop real high fevers get sick stop preening and doing typical mosquito avoidance behaviors and produce tons of virus in the bloodstream
8365328 it makes it very easy for mosquitoes to find and pick up virus
8365329 but it is equally relevant to human affairs including areas as diverse as religion economics and literature current trends in research and scholarship are not yet reflected in higher education evos was created to correct this imbalance
8365330 students consistently describe evos as an eye opening experience that helps them understand the world around them
8365331 in the future evolution will be regarded as essential for understanding humanity in addition to life as a whole the evos consortium will help accomplish the transition sooner rather than later
8365332 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8365333 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8365334 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8365335 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8365336 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families
8365337 there is no heaven of glory bright and no hell where sinners roast here and now is our day of torment here and now is our day of joy here and now is our opportunity choose ye this day this hour for no redeemer liveth
8365338 well if i made this more christian themed id do
8365339 if you cant keep up the artists will take a break and stop the music
8365340 why do they call it christian rock if its christian it isnt rock and if it rocks it isnt christian
8365341 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8365342 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8365343 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8365344 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8365345 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8365346 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8365347 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8365348 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8365349 peter would like to play if his health will permit him right now hes working on his health issues related to his foot and theres nothing new on that
8365350 it hasnt progressed to the point where were in serious discussions with the team
8365351 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8365352 if you are really interested in a hybrid which many people are there are several pros and cons you will really want to consider before you buy
8365353 one benefit is that hybrids obviously average better gas mileage than conventional gas vehicles however they are usually a couple thousand dollars more expensive and can take a few years to recoup the premium paid for them
8365354 due to limited supplies new hybrids are difficult to find consumers are sometimes required to make a deposit to be added to the end of a waiting list people interested in driving a hybrid should consider purchasing a used hybrid
8365355 to help find that perfect used car id recommend people look for an auto retailer with services that let you know when certain vehicles become available such as carmax coms inventory alert system and allows you to transfer used cars from one store to another
8365356 there are many vehicles that provide fuel efficiency beyond just hybrids
8365357 there are a number of non hybrid cars that can get more than 30mpg on the highway and we have the expertise and tools available to help people find a more gas friendly car
8365358 the role of corporate lobbyists and wealthy donors at the convention for a series of money trail reports
8365359 i will always be grateful to everyone from all 50 states puerto rico and the

8365362 i love you as a glad bird loves the freedom of its wings i love you as i love the first lily of spring exploding with clear fragrance in the moonlight i love you as i love the swell and hush of a low melody that brings the past to life again i love you as i love the tone of a soft breathing dawn whose soul has awaken for me alone
8365363 dear rob the astrologer i recently discovered your column and i like it but im wondering if im approaching it in the right way although im a crab all 12 of your horoscopes seem to make sense to me and describe how i feel is this ok curious in austin
8365364 you miasmic heap of shaved off cemetery warts you mangled preen of politicians tongue scabs you brackish tripe of experts ego tinkles you fragile crap of orphaned tyrants you demented cluster of fickle weasel vows you curdled slosh of rotting fracas spawned opinions
8365365 you may soon be blessed with a valuable new resource
8365366 get out there leo and acquire a tool or fuel or asset that will help you become more practical about fulfilling one of your dreams
8365367 i have dreamed in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas
8365368 they have gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the color of my mind
8365369 ask the wind the wave the star the bird the clock everything that is flying everything that is groaning everything that is rolling everything that is singing everything that is speaking
8365370 the cause of and solution to all of lifes problems
8365371 the cause of and solution to all of lifes problems
8365372 the real secret of magic is that the world is made of words
8365373 and that if you know the words that the world is made of you can make of it whatever you wish
8365374 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
8365375 came from a set of experiences that come from a life of living overseas having family overseas being able to see the world through the eyes of people outside our borders
8365376 if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it
8365377 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of these countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
8365378 poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to its neighbors
8365379 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destructions this is a guy who has destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient

8365400 regulations that implement proposition 103s mandate that insurance rates reflect a drivers mileage will lower auto insurance premiums particularly when the high cost of gasoline is encouraging people to drive less
8365401 they will also give consumers a financial incentive to carpool and promote mass transit and other transportation technologies that can reduce the impact of driving on our environment and our costly reliance on oil assembly member jared huffmans attention to this important issue along with other organizations led to todays announcement we also applaud commissioner poizners prompt action in drafting the proposed regulations
8365402 lawmakers and regulators have stepped up to the plate to help californians green their insurance policies and save people money
8365403 now insurance companies must do their part by giving drivers real savings when they drive less

8365410 this bill will benefit every party involved in foreclosure auctions
8365411 the bill reduces the amount of time and paperwork involved for clerks increases competition in bidding which leads to higher sale prices for the banks and reduces the number of vacant properties that drag on home values in the county
8365412 if we tried this three years ago the bill would have gone nowhere
8365413 the credit crunch and housing crisis that led to the massive increase in foreclosures made it apparent that a change was necessary

8365434 i expect a greater number of companies to use the secured bond market or put in place a platform off which to issue secured bond and bank debt as the price and terms of bank loan financing become more onerous
8365435 that will help boost the market but the fundamental change in monoline insurance will mean that companies that had previously relied on those guarantees to issue debt will no longer be able to issue
8365436 however we will need general market liquidity to improve before the market starts to accept significant new issues deal flow again

8365451 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side

8365454 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8365455 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8365456 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8365457 mccains plan to allow drilling wont result in a drop of oil for seven years and by his own account will have mainly a psychological impact but wont affect prices all current government estimates also indicate that even if we drilled along all of our coastlines we would not produce enough oil to alter global production and reduce prices here at home as long as we are dependent upon oil our fate is linked to decisions in other countries it is time for national leaders to support policies that match our own rhetoric more drilling on the ocs might give senator mccain a talking point to take home for the next election but it simply doesnt measure up to the challenges we face
8365458 like all compromises it also includes provisions that senator obama hasnt always supported and while he remains skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term he does welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future offshore drilling decisions based on science and fact

8365525 its fun to watch i know as a fan of other sports its always neat when theres something going on some story behind the scenes

8365532 culture is the expression of a people of a nation
8365533 attacking it like the tories are doing shows they are ideologically short sighted
8365534 thats dangerous we cant allow politicians to determine what is written what is seen what dances are allowed what songs are tolerable
8365535 i hope it has a determining effect on the harper government

8365552 it was a good toss to win there was something in the wicket for the spinners and they got a lot of turn even the pacers did well
8365553 all the member of the team backed each other and took up responsibility when it was required and this actually helped the team
8365554 suresh batted beautifully we were having a good partnership but we got out at crucial moments and did not score as much as we would have wanted in the last 10 overs i think we should have scored atleast 25 runs more
8365555 the toss proved crucial it put the indians in an advantageous position but i should say we made too many mistake along the way there was lack of consistent partnership from the batters and that did not help the team at all
8365556 we hope to put up a good show in the next match we need to avoid committing these silly mistakes
8365557 our blowers bowled brilliantly and we would like to win the series 4 1 personally i am very thankful to dhoni and venkatesh prasad for their constant encouragement which helped me to put up a big score

8365725 the special products provision alone could effectively negate any market access gains that might occur from a formula tariff cut
8365726 it allows developing countries to designate 12 percent to 13 percent of their tariff lines as special to take no tariff cuts on 5 percent of lines and to take only a 10 percent cut in tariffs on special products overall
8365727 to put this in perspective a 10 percent cut in a 40 percent ad valorem tariff leaves a 36 percent ad valorem tariff most economists agree that a developing country could use this level of special product provisions to shield virtually all economically significant tariff lines
8365728 in addition to this and other loopholes the lamy proposal would have allowed developing countries to use a special safeguard mechanism to increase tariffs in some instances to levels that are higher than the bound tariff rates currently in place
8365729 it would have been a bizarre outcome if the united states brought back a negotiating text that actually decreased market access for some u s agriculture exports
8365730 u s agricultures message to u s negotiators was clear
8365731 the united states is giving up 34 billion in allowable domestic support while getting virtually no market access in return and while allowing china to essentially take a free ride through these negotiations this is unacceptable
8365732 there would be no credible argument that there was a balance between u s domestic support reductions and market access gains the lamy proposal seems to prove that a doha agreement based on the falconer text named for new zealands crawford falconer chairman of the doha agricultural committee will leave worldwide agriculture with a skewed set of trade rules substantially in favor of large developing countries such as china and brazil
8365733 the fact he almost succeeded is a testament to lamys considerable influence and determination
8365734 the fact that the united states almost found itself with a doha agreement that no segment of the u s economy could root for demonstrates how far off course this negotiation has gone
8365735 as a result the united states entered the geneva meetings with little chance of closing enough of these loopholes to make a difference still administration negotiators went to geneva with optimism and worked extremely hard for a deal

8365751 its an option available to the fdic for additional liquidity and more broadly our borrowing resources its not something we expect to be using in the near term
8365752 we are reducing our rating to neutral as we are incrementally more cautious on the commercial performance of byetta following the latest update
8365753 we cannot conclude whether pancreatitis is any more an issue with byetta than other diabetes drugs however we think meaningful gains in the stock will require proof amylin lilly can jump start its growth in the second half 2008 against these latest headwinds and no negative new news from the ongoing healthcare database analysis
8365754 we are downgrading shares of amylin to sell from hold following last nights disclosure of four additional cases of mortality associated with pancreatitis in patients who were on byetta as we believe that a heightened vigilance for patient safety among primary care physicians will blunt the rate of glp 1 adoption driving byetta lars npv lower

8365775 we have the guys with the ability to give them time to throw and we have guys that can catch it but its always a facet of the game
8365776 the guys that have come before have really created that mentality especially the gilbreaths bryan and dayton of being exciting on defense and getting picks and causing fumbles
8365777 thats been embedded in these guys so itll be interesting to see who takes on that role
8365778 maslas not a big kid but hes a strong and aggressive kid

8365804 it can work in different ways for you you can have faster flankers in terms of reaction time at the breakdown then a bigger physical guy in terms of ball carrying ability
8365805 so it works differently for different teams and i guess it works around the way the team is coached as well

8365808 we intend for this to be a real negotiating process
8365809 if you are going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which we must and if we are to be credible negotiators in the essential negotiations coming up over the next 12 months or so to get a global deal then this is the necessary course of action

8365812 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8365813 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8365814 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8365815 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8365816 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8365817 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8365818 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8365819 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8365820 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8365821 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8365822 the days he practiced out here was going 100 percent he looked like shawne merriman to me
8365823 it is going to be something he has to manage i see him going out and playing playing on first and second downs and playing on third downs and rushing the passer if managing it means reducing his snaps at different times or picking specific situations where he doesnt need to be on the field that is what we will do

8365851 its real disappointing that rocky is taking a week off like that but well just have to deal with that
8365852 i think its a big shock for all of us but with that ruling it sets a precedent now so there will be nothing of the sort in bringing down lineouts like that even though it wasnt a really bad one it sets a precedent
8365853 had a clear view of the incident and while recognising the admitted illegal interference with matfield by elsom he quite distinctly assessed it as carrying insufficient risk to merit more than a penalty as he reported to referee lyndon bray
8365854 incident was contributed to when elsom lost the support of his lifter
8365855 interference of this kind carries real danger and a sanction is required
8365856 matfield gave telephonic evidence that he suffered an injury in the incident but completed the game without impediment any injury appeared minor and did not influence the decision
8365857 obviously does affect the mix and not just the starting team but the bench as well theres a bit to think about

8365911 there were some unusual challenges and plenty of room for honest differences of opinion
8365912 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous
8365913 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating

8365930 one thing about carl is hes getting more confident with every snap
8365931 now that he understands the offense hes playing fast and when you play fast and you play consistent youre going to have a chance to be successful in our offense im excited about what hes been doing
8365932 i definitely wouldnt have been ready to play this fall if i hadnt been here in the spring it was a good thing
8365933 i know the plays now and physically ive changed a lot i was like 269 pounds when i got here now im 290 pounds and have like only 16 percent body fat ive really changed a lot and its helped me
8365934 they would be non functional people now if they were not here in the spring
8365935 you all saw how carl moore looked in the spring now hes very dallas baker esque you say that name with reverence around here because he was such a good player for us he shows some of those same qualities
8365936 epps without spring football would not be ready now hes in the mix to either start or see a lot of playing time
8365937 i know my adjustments i know how to read the defense so right now i can say im really comfortable with the offense im really excited about playing
8365938 i knew i had an opportunity in the summer to get everything and learn everything i knew it was up to me i knew i determined my future so i knew if i put the work in id be fine
8365939 i had to learn a whole new system and get used to a whole new environment

8365946 she worked too hard not to be recognized and not to have her name placed on the nomination
8365947 its important that we are able to cast our votes for her and then turn around and cast our votes for barack obama
8365948 it not only highlighted the struggles she had in her career she talked about the womens movement which was critical and she also talked about uniting with barack and moving forward
8365949 and thats exactly what these delegates need to hear coming out of this convention

8365951 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models
8365952 it is amazing that economists on the average cannot out forecast households
8365953 i think its partly because inflation is hard to forecast even the weather plays a part
8365954 i think some of these basic things that affect prices nobody can forecast households or professional economists
8365955 households are right there in the nitty gritty seeing what groceries are doing when they go to the store seeing what gas prices are doing

8366025 no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8366026 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a byword for brilliance
8366027 that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket
8366028 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8366029 cricket is all about tradition and respecting previous generations and i am sure rickys speech will do just that as well as being a fitting tribute to a truly great cricket person

8366043 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
8366044 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
8366045 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
8366046 we canceled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
8366047 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
8366048 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
8366049 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards

8366061 we wanted businesses to have a crm system without any user constraints

8366075 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8366076 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
8366077 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8366078 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8366079 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8366080 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8366081 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families

8366088 the life death life nature in its most wildish form is as simple as a graceful exhalation ending and inhalation beginning the only trust required is to know that when there is one ending there will be another beginning there is usually no sense in waiting long enough until we are strong enough to trust because that day will never come so yes we take that chance that what we have been taught by our culture to believe about the life death life nature is wrong and that our instincts are right

8366145 well i think its a combination the guy i really respect on this is dr coburn he believes and i was just reading the thing he wrote that you should do what you can to encourage abstinence where there is going to be sexual activity where that doesnt succeed than he thinks that we should employ contraceptives as well but i agree with him that the first priority is on abstinence i look to people like dr coburn im not very wise on it

8366148 the market trades six days a week and having spoken with nearly all stallholders over the weekend they wish to continue trading
8366149 the short notice given to the stallholders gives us very limited time to find another operator
8366150 in the interim we are looking at the possibility of purchasing market stalls and operating the market ourselves
8366151 theyre flying me out six days after the pulver fight to mexico city to do a press conference and to make a huge announcement as i understand it both urijah and i are going i think both of us just need to hold up our ends of the bargain on sept 10 so yeah you essentially hit the nail on the head

8366153 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services
8366154 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8366155 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8366156 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8366157 technology for the web sites overall is still developing and there would need to be some flexibility in those standards
8366158 standards should not be dictated by any particular individual it needs to be a collaborative process
8366159 i am thrilled to pave the way for california drivers to obtain insurance that is more environmentally friendly and more accurately reflects driving habits

8366170 admittedly we are shifting in the kinds of jobs but generally they are higher paying jobs
8366171 the biggest reason jobs go away is not because of free trade but advances in technology that change the way we do things
8366172 the expansion of trade and global supply chains has undoubtedly played a role
8366173 there is no doubt that globalization has brought significant benefits to american consumers
8366174 its lowered prices on goods once considered luxuries from big screen tvs to peaches in winter and increased the purchasing power of low income americans
8366175 barack obama supports a trade policy that ensures our goods and services are treated fairly in foreign markets at the same time trade policy must stay consistent with our commitment to demand improved labor and environmental practices worldwide
8366176 from what i understand from cea interactions in denver the interesting takeaway is the number of policy makers who say they agree on trade but report how difficult the political environment is
8366177 hopefully once the political season is over well see a less charged environment and the trade agreements can be considered at that time
8366178 giving up meat could drastically reduce your carbon footprint with meat eaters diets responsible for almost twice the emissions of those of vegetarians a german study said on tuesday a diet with meat is responsible for producing in a year the same amount of greenhouse gases as driving a mid sized car 4 758 kilometres 2 956 miles the institute for ecological economy research ioew said but the food a vegetarian consumes in 12 months is responsible for generating the same emissions as driving 2 427 kilometres the ioew said in a study commissioned by independent consumer protection group foodwatch the calculations are based on emissions of greenhouse gases including methane produced by the animals themselves as well as emissions from food production including manufacturing feed and fertiliser and the use of farmland going vegan giving up meat and dairy products would cut the emissions released in making what you eat more than seven fold to the equivalent of driving 629 kilometres it said and if it is all organic your food footprint is almost a 17th of that of a meat eater the equivalent of driving 281 kilometres

8366221 erst radikalisiert er sich dann verl sst er den islam gleich ganz und am ende auch das wird im zweiten film dokumentiert
8366222 er hat das ganze system verstanden weshalb es eine absolute katastrophe f r ihn darstellt
8366223 ist sein eigenes leben weniger wichtig da er sich der wahrheit n her verpflichtet f hlt
8366224 der christliche gott schenkt dem menschen freiheit und barmherzigkeit der islam lehrt gewalt und schlie t die menschen ein
8366225 wir sehen jetzt durch einen spiegel ein dunkles bild dann aber von angesicht zu angesicht jetzt erkenne ich st ck weise dann aber werde ich erkennen wie ich erkannt bin
8366226 wenn du dich vor dem mord durch deine ex glaubensbr der retten willst musst du dich nach deinem ausscheiden aus dem islam schnell in die ffentlichkleit begeben am besten vor die kamera dann trauen sie sich vielleicht nicht
8366227 man sagt wir lebe im jahrhundert der aufkl rung richtiger w re der ausdruck wenn wir sagten im jahrhundert der d mmerung

8366232 der deutsch marokkanische prediger khalid cascais anfangs war er nur auf der suche nach spiritueller orientierung die ihm in der westlichen lebensweise fehlte er fing an die moschee zu besuchen und suchte das gespr ch mit imamen er ging in die abu bakr moschee in k ln zollstock die vor allem von arabischst mmigen muslimen und konvertiten genutzt wird und so gro en zulauf hat dass wir wirklich berrascht waren zum freitagsgebet stehen die m nner dort schlange bis auf die stra e das ist brigens die moschee in der sich angeblich auch einer der kofferbomber radikalisierte
8366233 seine meinung f r den willen gottes auszugeben seinen glauben unter androhung der todesstrafe und ewiger seelenqualen anderen aufzuzwingen ist bei einigen menschen zum h chsten grad an geistesdespotismus geworden umd diesen beiden drohungen zu widerstehen wurde bei anderen zur letzten anstrengung der nat rlichen freiheit

8366239 we have been unhappy with microsoft for some time before the release of exchange 2007 which included voip voice over internet protocol in its unified messaging suite it was time to offer our customers an alternative
8366240 if you think about what were going to do we usually acquire when we move into new markets that we do not have the expertise for the product segments in
8366241 once again cisco makes a sound investment in an email technology vendor just like it did with
8366242 these are the clever guys who reverse engineered the exchange client protocol mapi rpc and the related on the wire details needed to make a vanilla install of outlook talk to a non exchange mail server with full fidelity impressive stuff of all the other exchange alternatives postpath has the most interesting architecture and i say that as one who has years emotionally invested in the openmail technology
8366243 i think cisco fell out of love with microsoft a while back something to do with voip support in exchange and how cisco thought it was microsofts partner but it turned out that microsoft was competing with them nothing familiar there at all
8366244 sounds like cisco wants to offer saas collaboration based on postpath and webex whoever said the email world has become dull and uninteresting

8366259 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8366260 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8366261 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8366262 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8366263 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8366264 they can move on and get a student loan and get their first apartment and move on with their lives
8366265 people recognize that there are a lot better things we could be doing with our police resources

8366276 l disfruta con la alegr a de ella una alegr a sin afectaci n le sorprende que una hora y media por semana en compa a de una mujer le baste para sentirse feliz a l que antes cre a necesitar una esposa un hogar un matrimonio en fin de cuentas sus necesidades resultan ser muy sencillas livianas y pasajeras como las de una mariposa no hay emociones o no hay ninguna salvo las m s dif ciles de adivinar un bajo continuo de satisfacci n como el runr n del tr fico que arrulla al habitante de la ciudad hasta que se adormece o como el silencio de la noche para los habitantes del campo
8366277 supe que hab a sucedido algo irreparable en el momento en que un hombre me abri la puerta de esa habitaci n de hotel y vi a mi mujer sentada al fondo mirando por la ventana de muy extra a manera fue a mi regreso de un viaje corto s lo cuatro d as por cosas de trabajo dice aguilar y asegura que al partir la dej bien cuando me fui no le pasaba nada raro o al menos nada fuera de lo habitual ciertamente nada que anunciara lo que iba a sucederle durante mi ausencia salvo sus propias premoniciones claro est pero c mo iba aguilar a creerle si agustina su mujer siempre anda pronosticando calamidades l ha tratado por todos los medios de hacerla entrar en raz n pero ella no da su brazo a torcer e insiste en que desde peque a tiene lo que llama un don de los ojos o visi n de lo venidero y s lo dios sabe dice aguilar lo que eso ha trastornado nuestras vidas esta vez como todas mi agustina pronostic que algo saldr a mal y yo como siempre pas por alto su pron stico me fui de la ciudad un mi rcoles la dej pintando de verde las paredes del apartamento y el domingo siguiente a mi regreso la encontr en un hotel al norte de la ciudad transformada en un ser aterrado y aterrador al que apenas reconozco no he podido saber qu le sucedi durante mi ausencia porque si se lo pregunto me insulta hay que ver cu n feroz puede llegar a ser cuando se exalta me trata como si yo ya no fuera yo ni ella fuera ella intenta explicar aguilar y si no puede es porque l mismo no lo comprende la mujer que amo se ha perdido dentro de su propia cabeza hace ya catorce d as que la ando buscando y me va la vida en encontrarla pero la cosa es dif cil es angustiosa a morir y jodidamente dif cil es como si agustina habitara en un plano paralelo al real cercano pero inabordable es como si hablara en una lengua extranjera que aguilar vagamente reconoce pero que no logra comprender la trastornada raz n de mi mujer es un perro que me tira tarascadas pero que al mismo tiempo me env a en sus ladridos un llamado de auxilio que no atino a responder agustina es un perro fam lico y malherido que quisiera volver a casa y no lo logra y al minuto siguiente es un perro vagabundo que ni siquiera recuerda que alguna vez tuvo casa

8366280 sinti en su boca el suave olor de la fiebre y lo aspiro como si quisiera llenarse de las intimidades de su cuerpo y en ese momento se imagin que ya llevaba muchos a os en su casa y que se estaba muriendo de pronto tuvo la clara sensaci n que no podr a sobrevivir a la muerte de ella se acostar a a su lado y querr a morir con ella conmovido por esa imagen hundi en ese momento la cara en la almohada junto a la cabeza de ella y permaneci as durante mucho tiempo y le dio pena que en una situaci n como aquella en la que un hombre de verdad ser a capaz de tomar inmediatamente una decisi n l dudase privando as de su significado al momento mas hermoso que hab a vivido jam s estaba arrodillado junto a su cama y pensaba que no podr a sobrevivir a su muerte se enfad consigo mismo pero luego se le ocurri que en realidad era bastante natural que no supiera que quer a el hombre nunca puede saber que debe querer porque vive solo una vida y no tiene modo de compararla con sus vidas precedentes ni de enmendarla en sus vidas posteriores no existe posibilidad alguna de comprobar cual de las decisiones es la mejor porque no existe comparaci n alguna el hombre lo vive todo a la primera y sin preparaci n como si un actor representase su obra sin ning n tipo de ensayo pero que valor puede tener la vida si el primer ensayo para vivir es ya la vida misma por eso la vida parece un boceto pero ni un boceto es la palabra precisa porque un boceto es siempre un borrador de algo la preparaci n para un cuadro mientras que el boceto que es nuestra vida es un boceto para nada un borrador sin cuadro si cada uno de los instantes de nuestra vida se va a repetir infinitas veces estamos clavados a la eternidad como jesucristo a la cruz la imagen es terrible en el mundo del eterno retorno descansa sobre cada gesto el peso de una insoportable responsabilidad ese es el motivo por el cual nietzsche llam a la idea del eterno retorno la carga m s pesada pero si el eterno retorno es la carga m s pesada entonces nuestras vidas pueden aparecer sobre ese tel n de fondo en toda su maravillosa levedad la carga m s pesada nos destroza somos derribados por ella nos aplasta contra la tierra pero en la poes a amatoria de todas las pocas la mujer desea cargar con el peso del cuerpo del hombre la carga m s pesada es por lo tanto a la vez la imagen de la m s intensa plenitud de la vida cuanto m s pesada sea la carga m s a ras de tierra estar nuestra vida m s real y verdadera ser por el contrario la ausencia absoluta de carga hace que el hombre se vuelva m s ligero que el aire vuele hacia lo alto se distancie de la tierra de su ser terreno que sea real s lo a medias y sus movimientos sean tan libres como insignificantes

8366283 back to the roll call vote does anyone know what happens when a state says that they
8366284 madame secretary i move that senator barack obama of illinois be nominated by acclamation as this partys nominee for president of the united states
8366285 it will propose that this information will be gathered stored and
8366286 in the spirit of unity the great constituency of sunderland central former centre of shipbuilding and coal mining home of the nissan carplant casts all of its votes for the next government of the uk the conservative party
8366287 another bewildering moment for a non us citizen the opening of each days debate by a christian prayer followed by the national anthem and his is supposedly the leftist and secular party
8366288 hes a maverick he has the experience im voting for john mccain in fact many democrats are voting mccain its ok
8366289 its been a long time since a vp candidate bumped up a presidential candidate romney wont bump mccain up pawlenty wont bump him up theyre just couple of bumps
8366290 yeah neither mccain or obama are popular with the nra i suppose if guns is your biggest issue then youll vote bob barr
8366291 really the only thing you can choose here is the operating software so you can have a linux based product or windows based
8366292 thats pretty much the only configuration you can choose as opposed to the u s where you can configure everything you want
8366293 linux is highly used in emerging markets and widely accepted
8366294 it allows us to offer a more basic computing and affordable computing platform
8366295 they really were made with the emerging markets in mind and the needs of these small businesses
8366296 the products revolve around those needs affordability access to technology only the software they want basic computing needs
8366297 theres no question that some of our largest tech companies who have been so successful as global competitors are finding that there are new competitors from emerging markets and from even more advanced economies
8366298 the way for them to remain competitive and to keep growing is through designing products that reach out to consumers in emerging markets who have the purchasing power and now the desire to connect to the global economy through the internet and through technology
8366299 the key i think is designing products with the proper price points for consumers in emerging markets so its not a question only of innovation but a question of design and efficiency to reach those hundreds of millions of potential consumers
8366300 actually the companys not claiming 100 percent perfection nominum admits that any attacker has a 1 in 10 million chance per query of getting through
8366301 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8366302 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8366303 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8366304 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8366305 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8366306 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8366307 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8366308 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8366309 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8366310 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8366311 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8366312 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8366313 if it cant be done i have great concern that these hearings will be virtually or exclusively classified closed to the public and i might add to the detainees
8366314 we believe the capital markets ultimately will insist on ifrs for public companies
8366315 todays action by the sec continues a robust and thoughtful debate that is critical as the transition occurs
8366316 he was ahead of his time and he did everything himself
8366317 abie nathan loved life loved mankind and loved peace he painted israeli society with a unique shade of humanism and compassion
8366318 the peace ship is a project of the people we hope through this station we will help relieve the pain and heal the wounds of many years of suffering of the people of the middle east
8366319 we may well make it the capital of a future region

8366322 in our rush to develop the country we are making mistakes
8366323 we stand for preservation and modernization going hand in hand
8366324 there is a danger that expanding the imam ali shrine and building more hotels could mean demolishing parts of the old city
8366325 we support the development of the city in the best possible way
8366326 but we want the work done in a way that respects the spirit of a city that hosts imam ali
8366327 there will be no giving up of the old towns heritage and landmarks
8366328 oh i wanna live my life in a fairy tale where the end is always good and never sad
8366329 at least four people are under arrest in connection with a possible plot to kill barack obama
8366330 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
8366331 its fitting that john mccain and george bush will be meeting in the twin cities next week because its getting pretty hard to tell them apart
8366332 if a 30 year democrat spoke at the rnc excoriated his former party and endorsed the presidential candidate of the opposite party would the media cover it

8366347 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8366348 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8366349 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8366350 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8366351 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8366352 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8366353 she had her faculties and she made it clear that she did not want her feeding tube removed
8366354 she could laugh and she could giggle and she could shake her head yes and no

8366359 people are now more than ever participating in the web
8366360 everybody has their suite of sites and services that make the web unique to them
8366361 an example might be youre searching for a surprise gift for a loved one youre using a shared pc in an internet cafe
8366362 thats the business model for the web thats how the web is funded today in many cases
8366363 its a great step forward in terms of giving users more control
8366364 if youre blocking the content than youre also potentially frustrating the business model of web publishers and advertisers online
8366365 counter intuitive though it may be were definitely excited to see microsoft continue to invest in the browser
8366366 that the browser market is interesting to so many different groups right now is i think an important indicator for the health of the web

8366381 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
8366382 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
8366383 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
8366384 in my job as a dive guide i have seen many things from being right in the middle of a feeding frenzy with silky sharks to watching orcas eating hammerhead sharks
8366385 but nothing compared to what i saw that afternoon last august
8366386 it was difficult because i did not want to frighten it away so i stayed a few metres away
8366387 theres the row of little jumpers that allow for a bit of overclocking although crysis may be out of reach
8366388 theres a saying that no two countries that support the golden arches have ever been at war
8366389 admittedly we are shifting in the kinds of jobs but generally they are higher paying jobs
8366390 the biggest reason jobs go away is not because of free trade but advances in technology that change the way we do things
8366391 the expansion of trade and global supply chains has undoubtedly played a role
8366392 there is no doubt that globalization has brought significant benefits to american consumers
8366393 its lowered prices on goods once considered luxuries from big screen tvs to peaches in winter and increased the purchasing power of low income americans
8366394 barack obama supports a trade policy that ensures our goods and services are treated fairly in foreign markets at the same time trade policy must stay consistent with our commitment to demand improved labor and environmental practices worldwide
8366395 from what i understand from cea interactions in denver the interesting takeaway is the number of policy makers who say they agree on trade but report how difficult the political environment is
8366396 hopefully once the political season is over well see a less charged environment and the trade agreements can be considered at that time
8366397 free trade is in fact a message that the democrats new leadership could very well embrace
8366398 i was disappointed the way we played we had our opportunities
8366399 our one day cricket hasnt been consistent especially the overall performances with the bat
8366400 if you are not capable of getting the runs its quite difficult to win matches
8366401 that is something we really have to work with our guys need the confidence to go out there and express themselves which we have asked them to do
8366402 but they havent been consistent we definitely need to work hard and make sure we get it right because this is our future
8366403 especially with the injuries weve had guys who put up their hands and performed thilan thushara has been outstanding with ball and bat so was nuwan kulasekera
8366404 we just need to make sure our batting is consistent
8366405 at the start of the series i said in one day cricket you need to be very consistent with the bat putting runs on the board or chasing down targets we have to do it thats where we lost the series
8366406 we do have some cricket in the near future so its important that we finish on a high note
8366407 we played some really good cricket throughout the test series and one day series it will be disappointing if you just give up on the next game

8366411 wolf worries that the style of reading promoted by the net a style that puts efficiency and immediacy above all else may be weakening our capacity for the kind of deep reading that emerged when an earlier technology the printing press made long and complex works of prose commonplace when we read online she says we tend to become mere decoders of information our ability to interpret text to make the rich mental connections that form when we read deeply and without distraction remains largely disengaged

8366420 the hesitation i had about playing big shots has completely gone
8366421 ive received a lot of backing from the support staff and coaches especially when preparing this is a very good team and we just have to maintain the intensity
8366422 it depends on the team combination whenever and wherever i play i have to give it my best shot im glad i could contribute and im enjoying taking on the responsibility
8366423 i watched their hands closely and my plan was to read their actions and play in the v
8366424 i was able to read them easily out of the hand i didnt have too many hassles
8366425 even in the nets dhoni tells us how to plan
8366426 he reads the game extremely well hes played with a lot of responsibility this series and you get to learn a lot batting with him
8366427 praveen kumar munaf patel and zaheer khan have done outstandingly
8366428 look at the result theyve worked hard in the nets and in matches and you have to give credit to them you need to improve and set a tempo and weve played really good cricket here we had lost the asia cup final in pakistan and were really keen to do well we gave a really good show

8366430 protect yourself from real estate and mortgage fraud preserving the american dream of homeownership
8366431 i audit hundreds of real estate files every year and this file takes the cake
8366432 if anyone is looking for a trademark signature of mortgage fraud i think theyll find it here from fabrication of bruce mcclellans assets and making outrageous claims about mcclellans guaranteed return on his investment to making no real attempt to sell the investment property and taking cash back at closing here we have what appears to be knowingly committed mortgage fraud
8366433 what lindsey hunters company is under investigation for having done ruins lives destroys neighborhoods and is calculable in our current mortgage meltdown and housing crisis
8366434 people generally do not commit real estate or mortgage fraud for the sheer joy of ripping off the system although in lindsey hunters case with all the benefits he receives by virtue of playing in the nba if he did it then that would appear to be the primary motivation
8366435 if some of you were to devote the same energy to your jobs as you do to fantasy sports
8366436 so far weve cut between 10 000 and 20 000 plants
8366437 this could be the biggest eradication effort in utahs history
8366438 as farms in general have become larger within that population we see a disappearance of the side business
8366439 but i also see smaller farms hobby farms family residences that have tried to pick that up
8366440 you can usually get some help if they think theres going to be some free garlic in it for em

8366459 er glaubt dass das obama team ganz systematisch die erfolge seiner regierungszeit klein geredet hat er glaubt dass er w hrend der vorwahlen als rassist hingestellt wurde

8366474 wenn jemand noch ber die motive russlands bei der entfachung eines kriegs gegen georgien ger tselt hat sind diese zweifel nun zerstreut moskau hatte seine entscheidung von anfang an getroffen
8366475 europa und seine verb ndeten sind verpflichtet die integrit t georgiens zu verteidigen
8366476 zu wenig zu leise mit allzu viel verst ndnis und entschuldigend so lassen sich die reaktionen auf russlands angriff gegen georgien zusammenfassen jetzt bedarf es einer wesentlich sch rferen politik um der russischen herausforderung zu begegnen

8366500 it allows the grass to come in and when the timber is harvested it opens it up for the rcws

8366507 muchos no se dieron cuenta de esto porque estaban preocupados votando no podemos decir que toda la coreograf a es grabada porque no tenemos prueba de ello pero si que todo no est en tiempo real como lo dice una y otra vez gisela

8366511 it slowly eroded down but the number that most recently came in was 66 million of that 66 million which is actual loss only 8 million and i know thats a big number went to parishs clothes lifestyle and all that
8366512 most of the money he lost was not stealing for lifestyle benefits
8366513 it was being a big shot and going into a jewelry store and buying a 5 000 watch for 15 000

8366534 die westliche aufbauhilfe kommt nicht in den l ndlichen regionen an die afghanische regierung ist zu schwach und zu korrupt um kriegsherren und drogenbarone in die schranken zu weisen westlichen truppen und afghanischen sicherheitskr ften fehlt die schlagkraft um unruheregionen dauerhaft zu befrieden die nato staaten geraten immer mehr in streit wer den h chsten blutzoll zahlen muss und pakistan will es nicht oder schafft es nicht den taliban kommandos ihre r ckzugsbasen im grenzgebiet zu nehmen

8366536 auch friedensmissionen fordern ihren tribut weshalb tut sich berlin mit diesem eingest ndnis so schwer
8366537 die wohlfeilen bekundungen von abscheu und emp rung der politiker wirken ritualisiert und wenig glaubw rdig nicht nur f r die angeh rigen des toten soldaten
8366538 krieg hat keinen anstand dass deutsche soldaten im norden afghanistans vor allem den friedlichen aufbau sch tzen st rt weder taliban noch sonstige terroristen in ihrem t dlichen treiben

8366575 ever notice that when youre single all everybody talks to you about is how great it is to be a couple and how when youre in a couple everyone tries to tell you how much fun youre missing in the single life ever notice how you believe them the phenomenon is as old as the hills but people still fall for it desperate people end up in crappy relationships people in pretty healthy relationships just pick up and leave because they dont want to miss out so ive gotta ask is the grass always greener
8366576 we do understand canadians frustration with fuel price volatility in particular but at the same time in our view thats the best evidence of a well functioning competitive market
8366577 in our view canadians are well served by a competitive marketplace and today they still pay the second lowest price for fuel in the western world
8366578 the oil companies are making huge profits when consumers are dinged at the pumps
8366579 its not the folks who are delivering fuel to canadians all over that are making money
8366580 at least 70 per cent of canadas gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8366581 the price of diesel affects every economic sector because it affects public transportation it affects the cost of goods that are transported
8366582 why is it that consumers seem to have more knowledge than the people who work in the industry
8366583 oh since i am so stupid i might as well do it again someday

8366587 i dropped the ladys money and i was screaming go run run run and everyone just took off and then all you hear is the crash
8366588 to me the inability to sell one of your assets is a restraint of trade i think it is a disgrace
8366589 it would be very very difficult a lot of teams would struggle
8366590 im not sure who we were playing was it hereford or a combined team or premier league and championship players
8366591 it is no good people saying he has done it with a load of players that arent his he has used his budget to best effect
8366592 it the end it is a mad rush and leaves you very vulnerable
8366593 i cannot for the life of me think of one positive thing about it
8366594 you cant do that in case wayne rooney becomes available
8366595 it is that time of year again as the days tick down until the transfer window to use accepted parlance slams shut expect more rumour and wild speculation while football reporters in television studios wait anxiously for their shiny mobile
8366596 life can be confusing in this little outcrop of rock in the north atlantic we cant even agree on what we disagree on there arent many places on earth where people boo their own national anthem although to be fair
8366597 if defeat presents an opportunity to reflect and learn then last week could have been very significant in brazilian football brazils quest to win olympic gold was put back another four years after they went down 3 0 to argentina in
8366598 leaping ahead from the bible to shakespeare to dostoevsky wood renders the sacred narrative obsolete and comes close to doing the same for shakespeare david in the old testament addresses god just as macbeth entreatingly addresses the theatrical audience but in crime and punishment raskolnikovs soliloquies are conversations with the reader who can penetrate thoughts that remain unvoiced the novel is the product of hegels secularised spirituality and must as wood concedes be understood religiously its characters want to be known which means to be forgiven in gods absence the readers conscience has to scrutinise their confessions and arrive at a proper judgment

8366608 in my time and my moms time blacks and latinos have had a rivalry with jobs it seemed that jobs went to blacks over latinos i came to this county as an immigrant from mexico and told that this county was about equality but it seemed like everything was about favoritism african americans seemed to get more jobs and better pay because they seemed more american than latinos
8366609 for me its not about jobs or stuff like that it has always been about territory when i say that i dont mean gangs or anything but just where we live in primarily latino communities african americans have slowly come in and taken over our home towns
8366610 blacks and mexicans have fought for the same things separately its sad because if we worked together for better jobs better pay and more respect then maybe we could reach it sooner but we fight separately and we fight against each other
8366611 im not voting for that man im voting for my girl

8366614 the people behind me are crucial to the future of this country
8366615 why do we need 60 democrats why is reid the first senate majority leader to say we need 60 votes rather than a majority to get things done
8366616 in 2005 when republicans had a majority they stopped democratic filibusters why cant you do the same now
8366617 they have a story line but i want us to all shout loud and clear so the press can hear it we are united behind obama
8366618 its unacceptable that in every major issue of our time we are going backwards not forwards
8366619 theyre not relying on his celebrity factor or the coolness of obama they have invested real resources into getting out the youth vote
8366620 thats your representative you folks must really be proud of her

8366746 at the very beginning there was this impression he had absconded with 500 million
8366747 it slowly eroded down but the number that most recently came in was 66 million of that 66 million which is actual loss only 8 million and i know thats a big number went to parishs clothes lifestyle and all that
8366748 most of the money he lost was not stealing for lifestyle benefits

8366750 it means diabetic wounds can be actually healed rather than just offering palliative care

8366786 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8366787 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8366788 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8366789 the weakness in the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8366790 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good
8366791 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8366792 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane

8366796 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8366797 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8366798 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8366799 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8366800 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8366801 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8366802 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8366803 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8366804 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8366805 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8366806 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8366807 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8366808 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8366809 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8366810 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this

8366856 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8366857 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8366858 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8366859 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8366860 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8366861 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8366862 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8366863 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8366864 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8366865 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8366866 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8366867 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8366868 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8366869 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8366870 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8366871 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8366872 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8366873 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8366874 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8366875 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8366876 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8366877 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8366878 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8366879 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8366880 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8366881 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8366882 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8366883 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8366884 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8366885 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8366886 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8366887 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8366888 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8366889 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8366890 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8366891 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8366892 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8366893 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8366894 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8366895 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8366896 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8366897 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8366898 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8366899 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8366900 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8366901 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8366902 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8366903 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8366904 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8366905 no one works for someone we all just work together
8366906 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8366907 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8366908 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8366909 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8366910 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8366911 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8366912 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8366913 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8366914 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8366915 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8366916 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8366917 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8366918 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8366919 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8366920 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8366921 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8366922 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8366923 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8366924 well tim you know i cant say to somebody that he cant say that he thinks im a good guy
8366925 i have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements and i think that indicates to the american people what my stance is on those comments

8366933 now ukraines economy and politics largely depend on what side of the bed the prime minister gets up from
8366934 the most active mechanisms of influence on the country are accumulated in her hands not in the hands of a distrusted president
8366935 the businessman operates the three most efficient instruments of influence money big money and very big money
8366936 in addition to the great concert footage that has been submitted for inclusion in our
8366937 hi def from red rocks featuring the string cheese incident
8366938 i repeat that it is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8366939 ukraine could be the next political pressure point for russia therefore it is important from a stability point of view to send a positive signal that it is possible for ukraine to progress towards the union
8366940 however that would not be ruled out as part of a global settlement in accord with the united nations
8366941 many athletes simply win but she will remain in the hearts of people forever
8366942 she can do everything on ice a huge responsibility lies with every olympic champion as many fans desire to see their idol performing after the competition is over thats exactly what oksana is doing now
8366943 she has two full practices per day and keeps herself in great shape
8366944 oksana please i am begging you go and play with your peers instead of listening to old people talk
8366945 all officials of ukraine think about what they can do to promote the positive image of ukraine in the world
8366946 and now we have the most popular board game in the world played by 715 million kids teenagers and adults all seeking to be owner the world its a pr campaign free of charge for many years
8366947 we gathered a small group of active people who started a campaign on the internet and later more people joined us spreading information about the campaign among ukrainians living in ukraine and abroad

8366966 the level of noise from a helicopter is very low so neighbors dont complain
8366967 there is an absolute vacuum of small aviation in ukraine in soviet times there were many professional ukrainian pilots but the old professionals retired and there were few flight schools training replacements we decided to be the pioneers
8366968 such strictness in licensing is needed because flying a helicopter is not easy it is not like driving a car
8366969 and pilots must pass rigorous physicals because any health problem could lead to tragedy
8366970 imagine if you drive from kyiv to donetsk on the car and there were no petrol stations on the way
8366971 it will take time for the country to adapt to light aviation

8367059 we are delighted to add catbird to the mcafee security innovation alliance
8367060 virtual environments present new security challenges and catbird has responded with innovative network security offerings that complement mcafees system security suites and management solutions for virtualized data centers and desktops
8367061 enterprise customers expect to use the same tools to manage security across both their physical and virtual infractructure

8367063 all of the inherent capabilities and benefits of sansymphony can be available to an enterprise if it simply passes the volumes containing the live application data through datacores sansymphony
8367064 when that data volume is passed through sansymphony it is simply remapped to the application server so the server can immediately run the server applications while the application server is running datacores software adds value to those volumes caching performance high availability snapshot aim etc
8367065 datacore can do this because we support heterogeneous environments and because we are hardware agnostic
8367066 there is no real motivation for the hardware storage array vendors to make it easy to migrate data off of their platforms datacore on the other hand has every motivation to enable users to use whatever platform they please and to migrate data at will from any platform to any platform
8367067 here is a way to go back in time and recover virtual machines or data
8367068 what if you have a vmware server with 20 different vms on it and the machine died with datacore sansymphony and its traveller cdp capability you can easily and quickly roll back time and save those 20 machines

8367071 virtualization technologies are changing the face of the modern enterprise helping to transform legacy computing storage and networking processes into more versatile business solutions
8367072 virtualization is no longer just for the data center it has also emerged as the catalyst of change behind todays storage practices and use of desktop systems
8367073 we have come to respect entisys for its ethics values and deep commitment to our success as an organization
8367074 entisys broad based expertise in the deployment of virtualization technologies has helped us to view virtualization not as a tactical solution but rather as a strategy to help us solve true enterprise challenges from the datacenter to the desktop

8367079 creating 3d maps and worlds can be extremely labor intensive and time consuming also the final result might not be all that accurate or realistic a new technique developed by scientists at the university of manchesters school of computer science and dolby canada however might make capturing depth and textures for 3d surfaces as simple as shooting two pictures with a digital camera one with flash and one without first an image of a surface is captured without flash the problem is that the different colors of a surface also reflect light differently making it difficult to determine if the brightness difference is a function of depth or color by taking a second photo with flash however the accurate colors of all visible portions of the surface can be captured the two captured images essentially become a reflectance map albedo and a depth map height field

8367214 it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive
8367215 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened

8367218 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
8367219 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
8367220 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
8367221 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
8367222 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
8367223 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in

8367231 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8367232 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8367233 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission

8367237 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8367238 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

8367245 when i read stories regarding how the american health service is i am just so thankful we have the national health service i really do believe we do not pay our nurses or staff anywhere near enough money
8367246 look at the list of the eleven names attached to the report there is only one gp the rest are academic or administrative hospital doctors and managers not a single representative of the royal college of nursing no psychiatrist no physiotherapist no one who can advise darzi about what is really going on this is not a consensus report this is unadulterated darzi

8367251 euroland either is now going backwards or is on the edge of declines in output in which case the uk strategy under this government of hitching us more firmly to the eu governmental bandwagon is doubly foolish being bad economics as well as bad politics

8367257 the article takes several not so subtle shots at the prime minister
8367258 more likely however is that it simply betrays an appalling lack of good judgment
8367259 even the language must remain the same the better to reinforce a stifling orthodoxy
8367260 if a prime ministers best hope of staying in office is putting it about that his foreign secretary is not up to the job he really is in trouble
8367261 it was clear he was far from well yet he treated us to his usual incisive analyses of the current political situation as well as his sardonic wit during the 30 odd years that i knew him it was his humour that i most savoured

8367264 i predict that when i come back on this programme in six months time or a year people will be saying wouldnt it be great to have that blair back because we cant stand that gordon brown

8367269 funnily enough people seem to be more upset about the abolition of the 10p tax rate and sleaze than the candidates belief or otherwise in transubstantiation
8367270 funny now that curran is seeking to do the same thing that labour are trying to airbrush that story out of history
8367271 i canvassed for david davis on the eve of the by election the uncertain did not want to discuss we had a single conversation with a man who did raise 42 days he was for locking them up but not on consideration if they were innocent

8367275 i am a simple soul and do not claim to understand all of the issues involved but i do know that i would not want the police to have the freedom to haul me off the street lock me up for 42 days without charge without a trial and without me knowing precisely what i was suspected of
8367276 if he has to start moralising i would have a lot more respect for him if he did so in a context that acknowledged the racism so many black people still face and looked at serious policies to tackle poverty and an education system that condemns some of our most vulnerable young people to failure

8367285 we face few issues more difficult complex or important than separation of powers in general and excesses of the executive branch in particular
8367286 the greatest calamity which would befall us would be submission to a government of unlimited powers
8367287 president george bushs top advisers are not immune from congressional subpoenas a federal judge ruled today in an unprecedented dispute between two political branches of the us government house democrats called the ruling a ringing endorsement of the principle that nobody is above the law in his ruling us district judge john bates said there is no legal basis for bushs argument and that his former legal counsel harriet miers must appear before congress he said that both bolten and miers must give congress all non privileged documents related to the firings the ruling is a blow to the bush administrations efforts to bolster the power of the executive branch of the us government at the expense of the legislative branch

8367309 maybe im not cut out for this this is real tough

8367311 for not having a front license plate as well as obstructed vision of the driver
8367312 within the standards of training prescribed by the state of wisconsin
8367313 there had been adequate time for those with a sincere interest in reviewing it to have seen it
8367314 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8367315 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8367316 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8367317 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8367318 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8367319 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8367320 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8367321 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8367322 who are open to doing something on the production side
8367323 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8367324 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8367325 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8367326 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8367327 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8367328 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8367329 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

8367331 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8367332 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8367333 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8367334 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8367335 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8367336 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8367337 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8367338 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8367339 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8367340 the species used for a money tree plant is formally known as pachira aquatica it is native to swamp lands in south america the plant itself is already considered to be fortunate by followers of feng shui because of its five lobed palmate leaves a money tree plant with leaves in clusters of seven another powerful number is considered to be especially lucky the leaves of the money tree plant are edible along with the flowers and nuts that it forms the lucky trees can often be found in powerful places in the home because plants and living things are supposed to be good for feng shui
8367341 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8367342 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8367343 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8367344 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8367345 part of a cost cutting exercise needed to immediately bring the charity back to a stable financial situation
8367346 our duty is to support and protect some of the most vulnerable and poorly treated people in the shipping world and protecting the services we provide to them means that we have to take difficult decisions
8367347 we do not take these decisions lightly but we have to consider our mission and the best use of our supporters donations
8367348 we depend heavily on our annual sea sunday appeal to underpin our fundraising but with only 50 per cent of parishes taking part and declining mass attendance we have seen the revenue from this decrease year on year
8367349 this painful process must be endured in order to continue our vital work in the ports we are grateful to all those who have been in touch to pledge their support and want to reassure all our donors that apostleship of the sea will emerge stronger and leaner ready to meet all the challenges of the 21st century
8367350 primary prevention such as modifications in diet and physical activity and control of gerd symptoms may be able to slow this trend
8367351 in these tough economic times it is crucial that state agencies spend wisely and find ways to cut costs
8367352 buying only equipment they need is an easy step agencies can take to alleviate budget pressure even small amounts can add up to make a big difference statewide every dime counts
8367353 we accept the findings of this audit we think its constructive it points out areas of improvement for us it also confirms efforts already underway and weve begun to address some of these things
8367354 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8367355 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8367356 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom will you vote
8367357 this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8367358 the border of three different cultures and perhaps this is why he was open
8367359 we see in him a commitment that can be explained only by a soul truly fascinated by the light of the gospel in love with christ and having a deep conviction that it is necessary to give the world the light of christ to proclaim the gospel to all
8367360 we see the greatness the beauty or rather the necessity of the gospel for all of us
8367361 that our hearts too would be touched by christs words so that we too can give the light of the gospel of the truth to the world that is thirsting for it
8367362 the greeks understand that this god of the christians and the jews was not a god foreign to their culture but is the unknown god they had been expecting and the true response to the deepest questions of their culture
8367363 observing the sabbath circumcision and the dietary restrictions that separated the israelites from the rest of the world
8367364 whether or not a truly universal church would be born
8367365 was convinced that jesus was the hope of israel and that suffering for jesus he suffered for the hope of israel
8367366 he was very much opposed to separation he saw the methodist societies as within the established church and anything that smacked of separation was something he took a very strong view of
8367367 at one point in the journal he is talking to the society at grimsby and goes into block capitals and says i told them i would remain with them as long as they remained with the church of england but should they ever turn their back on the church they turn their back on me
8367368 he john is insensible of both his own folly and danger and of the divine goodness in so miraculously saving him
8367369 nice to see you again julietta no juliet si i remember now like the play
8367370 can you how do you say make this one bigger and make the other smaller
8367371 it looks better this way can you move the phone numbers and make them bigger
8367372 im sorry juliet i cant leave tonight without touching you at least once should i not
8367373 your body is amazing ive wanted to touch you since the first time i saw you
8367374 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8367375 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8367376 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8367377 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8367378 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8367379 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8367380 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8367381 i dont care even if she is verbally abused frankly she deserves it
8367382 oooh someone spoke nastily to my poor sister what on earth should she do
8367383 really well i have been on the receiving end of insults as a result of perfectly legal personal decisions and i did and do exactly the same as i suggested riazats sister do i e i ignore them
8367384 so other than lazy stereotyping and assumptions about those of us who think that she handled it badly what was your point
8367385 strange though predictable that the guardian pick your comment to highlight
8367386 whilst ignoring heresiarchs much more recommended comment and one might observe
8367387 apparently being perfectly happy with the regular abuse thrown at the religious here on cif
8367388 many people find the veil offensive fact its not hard to see why
8367389 my understanding of freedom of expression includes the right to wear what you want as long as it does no harm or break the law
8367390 politeness and consideration for the feelings of others is what should stop people making rude comments but then again politeness and consideration for the feelings of others is what should stop people wearing cloths that cover their faces
8367391 she seemed to have taken that abuse pretty much in stride and it was not something she dwelt over nor solicited readers for help with appropriate putdowns how is her sisters experience different or worse perhaps her sister chided muslim men in mosques and in the muslim media for demeaning non hijabis and hindu women we should be told we might have more sympathy for her and ms butt need not cry so much

8367405 unless mugabe and his inner circle have an incentive to hand over power to someone more reasonable its hard to see anything other than a continuing collapse
8367406 david icke has been unfairly lampooned for his insane and stupid views and for being insane and stupid
8367407 all this proves for labour and gordon brown is that they cant compete in rural well off seats in the south but then we all knew that
8367408 with the lib dems fighting hard it was always going to be that the labour vote would get squeezed and in the event the overall percentage of 3 1 was not as bad as the party has seen in other similar contests in winchester in 1997 for instance labour was reduced to just 1 7

8367455 is an example of how advancements in science and technology are leading to new medical care diagnostics said dr daniel schultz director of the fdas center for devices and radiological health in a statement the agency issued wednesday
8367456 this clearance and the fdas focus on this field underscore the growing importance of molecular diagnostics in the care of patients said xdxs chief executive pierre cassigneul in a company statement
8367457 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8367458 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8367459 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8367460 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8367461 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8367462 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8367463 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8367464 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8367465 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8367466 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8367467 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8367468 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8367469 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8367470 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8367471 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8367472 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8367473 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8367474 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8367475 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8367476 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8367477 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8367478 what doe the tattoo on your back mean where did you get it from
8367479 we received a call at the police station at 11 50 on friday
8367480 the caller said there was an unconscious football player on the field he morales was unconscious when we got there and we got him into the ambulance right away
8367481 it can be from a fatal irregular heart rhythm an abnormality of the heart muscle a problem with the structure of the heart or how the heart is working or how the electrical condition of the heart is working
8367482 the thing is its usually unusual so when it does happen its tragic
8367483 in europe they do it more the doctors will give the athletes an electrocardiogram and ask for the familys history along with a physical exam
8367484 in this country the whole issue is that sports are being cut so forget health screenings they probably just listen to your heart with a stethoscope but shouldnt we be doing more
8367485 at the end of our time together many people especially some of the newer bishops said that they had been surprised by the amount of convergence they had seen
8367486 and there can be no doubt that practically all who were present sincerely wanted the communion to stay together
8367487 the conference design group believed strongly that the chief need of our communion at the moment was the rebuilding of relationships the rebuilding of trust in one another and of confidence in our anglican identity
8367488 i believe that the conference succeeded in doing this to a very remarkable degree more than most people expected
8367489 as the proposals for an anglican covenant now go forward it is still possible that some will not be able to agree
8367490 cannot hold in tension convictions and practices that are incompatible and so not patent of reconciliation
8367491 damage the life and witness of anglican churches as much in the global south as in north america and in other provinces that have followed the lead of the episcopal church
8367492 how far the intensified sense of belonging together will help mutual restraint in such matters as same sex blessings remains to be seen
8367493 this is the only way to empower the peace camp in palestine and reverse the trend of radicalization thus creating an atmosphere conducive to reunifying the palestinian territories under the leadership of that peace camp
8367494 laura bush 2 0 who whips up casseroles and touts abstinence in a haze of nicotine patch induced ennui
8367495 she also pointed out that it was thanks to tony blair we were there at all shes a libdem i clapped
8367496 the chief threat in the region i see right now is the threat to saudi arabia by iran and al qaeda if al qaeda were to overthrow the present royal family in saudi arabia or attack the strait of hormuz cutting off the oil supply to western nations including japan and china it would bring down entire world economies france and germany would be begging us to go to war to retake those oil wells it would be world war iii
8367497 france and the european economies would collapse in a matter of weeks
8367498 another looming concern is iran which wants to develop nuclear weapons to couple with their shahab 4 5 amp 6 missiles on the drawing boards which have a range to hit london israel all of europe southern russia and the united states also the iranian government has said it initially had 300 centrifuges to enrich uranium to weapons grade material they have increased that to 3 000 they will soon increase that again to 10 000 centrifuges
8367499 they have the additional capacity to add another 20 000 centrifuges in mass production techniques that will enable them to produce at least seven nuclear bombs in about a year where did they get these centrifuges
8367500 they probably got them from saddam hussein before the iraq war started and were probably smuggled out of iraq and into iran just like he did his air force of 600 soviet fighter planes in other words he gave them to his former enemy rather than let them be destroyed on the ground
8367501 why would he have done any differently with the 30 000 centrifuges he supposedly had on a decentralized basis inside iraq before the war
8367502 isnt it strange that iran could come up with a nuclear weapons program in about six months to a year when it took the united states six years under the manhattan project with 5 000 of the worlds most brilliant scientists like robert oppenheimer niels bohr seaborg einstein fermi and others working on it
8367503 it is time for the israelis and palestinians to return to the peace talks resume where they left off and
8367504 and its all related to the palestinian israeli conflict which i said back in 1987 was the crux of my book it always has been and always will be until its settled
8367505 that linkage is exactly what osama bin laden stated in a taped message aired the weekend before the election in november of 2004 whether you believe him or not is beside the point thats whats he told us and wed better take that into account
8367506 its like a marriage where both spouses storm away mad in an argument they dont divorce and then try to resume their relationship they come back together settle their differences and resume their marriage it must be the same for the middle east peace talks
8367507 the book is absolutely stunning in the manner in which mr spirko tells his tale he is truly a master as an analyst and its totally unlike anything else weve ever read in a spy thriller it keeps you turning pages and wont let you quit until the very end and what an ending it is if you crave twisting plots thrilling spy action and intriguing characters then this is the book for you
8367508 if books were rated by siskel amp roeper it would be given a two thumbs up
8367509 the rat will become aggressive at the tail end of the year and its underlying water element will cool the stock market
8367510 it is not enough to be very good if you have the ability to be great
8367511 actually its not as if your angels can just drop everything theyre doing and come running whenever you call for assistance guidance and love you pretty much are everything theyre doing before you even ask
8367512 the end he the artist strives for is something else than a perfectly executed print his aim is to depict dreams ideas or problems in such a way that other people can observe and consider them
8367513 but it is equally relevant to human affairs including areas as diverse as religion economics and literature current trends in research and scholarship are not yet reflected in higher education evos was created to correct this imbalance
8367514 students consistently describe evos as an eye opening experience that helps them understand the world around them
8367515 in the future evolution will be regarded as essential for understanding humanity in addition to life as a whole the evos consortium will help accomplish the transition sooner rather than later

8367613 it becomes less and less obvious why you would buy an itanium system
8367614 it would strike me how the timing by super micro is off
8367615 our support of the itanium solutions alliance reflects our commitment to the market for itanium based solutions
8367616 we expect our customers to value the vast processing power exceptional reliability and application flexibility that our itanium based servers deliver and supporting the alliance serves those customers and our business very well
8367617 you have hp building and selling itanium systems that are primarily targeted at the significant and aging pa risc install base that would want to stay loyal to hp ux
8367618 super micro must have the confidence that they can build and sell enough of these things to make money
8367619 tukwila is going to be a big step up in every performance category from the previous itanium generation montvale itll be on a 65nm process versus 90nm
8367620 so even though itanium has been putting up good growth numbers most sources are saying something like 30 per cent to 40 per cent for the last quarter the market is really waiting on the next gen

8367629 these e mails get more pathetic as they go on this was not a malfunction a person directed by jim slattery wrote these words deliberately now they are upset because they got caught
8367630 he could have stepped up to the plate personally like a statesman and taken responsibility for his staff and the climate of name calling and childishness he has fostered instead he and his team chose to throw a junior staffer under the bus and hoped no one would notice

8367641 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8367642 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8367643 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8367644 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8367645 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world

8367668 rec solars vision is to make solar electricity part of the mainstream energy supply to make that shift in paradigm a reality we recognize that we must reach out to the next generation of energy consumers in their preferred online medium
8367669 with the assistance of myspace the solar recharging stations are designed to not only raise awareness of alternative energy sources that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels but also to encourage a sense of community both online and offline

8367703 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8367704 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8367705 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

8367731 it does not seem to me a good reason to decline prosecuting a new experiment which apparently increases the power of man over matter until we can see to what that power may be applied

8367774 over time the third party can create a profile of which web sites you go to what links you click on etc
8367775 historically microsoft has done a good job of giving enterprise security teams a fair amount of configuration control of applications from within
8367776 essentially if written policy states that all browsing history is kept then more than likely the enterprise will be given the ability to disable the inprivate mode

8367981 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8367982 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8367983 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8367984 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8367985 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8367986 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8367987 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8367988 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8367989 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8367998 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8367999 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8368000 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8368001 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8368002 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8368003 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8368004 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority

8368015 there is a danger that expanding the imam ali shrine and building more hotels could mean demolishing parts of the old city

8368017 but we want the work done in a way that respects the spirit of a city that hosts imam ali
8368018 there will be no giving up of the old towns heritage and landmarks

8368020 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8368021 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8368022 the office of the commissioner has assured us that we have a valid contract with pedro and that it will vigorously defend any claim to the contrary
8368023 in fact the contract between the kansas city royals and eric hosmer another boras client was submitted to the office of the commissioner after our contract with pedro was submitted
8368024 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8368025 despite our disappointment we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8368026 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8368027 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8368028 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8368029 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8368030 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8368031 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8368032 they can move on and get a student loan and get their first apartment and move on with their lives
8368033 people recognize that there are a lot better things we could be doing with our police resources

8368048 laredo is growing at record speed to ensure this growth continues we must put policies in place that promote free trade and make the exportation of texas made goods as efficient a process as possible at the same time its critical that we strike the right balance between successful trade operations and effective security that keeps texas and the country safe one area where we can strike this balance is at our ports of entry ive introduced legislation that would boost efficiency for trade by improving infrastructure at our ports of entry and adding more lanes to reduce wait times on the security front this bill also provides for additional resources to hire more inspectors to ensure security operations are top notch

8368051 india and pakistan are both nuclear armed countries all of the agriculture in pakistan and all of the agriculture in northern india depend on glacier fed rivers that come off the himalayas from the tibetan plateau those glaciers are melting
8368052 theyre melting according to chinese scientists to 7 per cent a year which means theyre half gone in 10 years
8368053 india has a problem with this pakistan faces an absolutely lethal emergency because pakistan is basically a desert with a braid of rivers running through it
8368054 those rivers all start with one exception in indian controlled territory and theres a complex series of deals between the two countries about who gets to take so much water out of the river those deals break down when theres not that much water in the rivers

8368056 we cannot eliminate this practice but we can and will work to a code of practice so that the children dont get hurt the law isnt broken and the people who do want to take part dont get prosecuted
8368057 we have to take into account peoples beliefs and their rights and we will respect them
8368058 but we are not above the law and we never will be and working with the authorities is the best chance weve got to prevent any harm being brought against any children
8368059 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore
8368060 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8368061 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it
8368062 was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8368063 indeed the prosecution relied as part of its evidence upon the president of the local shia community centre
8368064 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute by the crown prosecution service was the correct one
8368065 this is a very unusual case and the first of its kind to be prosecuted by the cps in england and wales

8368076 the biggest thing he brings to the ticket is he is qualified to be president of the united states
8368077 everybody when they talk about potential vice presidential candidates they put them in different categories here is one that can help the ticket by delivering a state here is one that can help the ticket by delivering an interest group but they always talk about joe biden he is the one who if something happens to barack obama he is qualified and i think that what is says about barack obama he is not in this thing to win this he is in this to make america a better place and a better place in the world
8368078 biden should and probably will go after john mccain and the republicans hard
8368079 if he does not and its a mild mannered presentation i think the delegates will leave very disappointed
8368080 everyone is going to be measuring every word that clinton says because it is very well known that he has been unhappy with obama some have said that he has been pouting
8368081 he and his people have certainly been leaking quite a number of crucial comments from clinton about obama so his words will be weighed carefully and he will come through he knows he is under the microscope he will be very enthusiastic while the cameras are on
8368082 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines

8368109 i have suggested from a theological point of view the roles of chance and necessity should be seen as reflections of the twin gifts of freedom and reliability bestowed on his creation by one who is both loving and faithful gods gift of freedom to his creation is conveyed by his respect for the integrity of these processes the act of creation involves divine acceptance of the risk of the existence of the other and there is a consequent kenosis of gods omnipotence this curtailment of divine power is of course through self limitation on his part it arises from the logic of love which requires the freedom of the beloved

8368111 it would be difficult to identify a president who facing major international and domestic crises has failed in both as clearly as president bush
8368112 have had the cumulative effect of shoring up a semi permanent aristocracy of capital that dwarfs the aristocracy of land against which the founding fathers rebelled of encouraging a mindless retreat from science and rationalism and of crippling the nations economic base
8368113 glib contemptuous ignorant incurious a dupe of anyone who humors his deluded belief in his heroic self he has bankrupted the country with his disastrous war and his tax breaks for the rich trampled on the bill of rights appointed foxes in every henhouse compounded the terrorist threat turned a blind eye to torture and corruption and a looming ecological disaster and squandered the rest of the worlds goodwill in short no other presidents faults have had so deleterious an effect on not only the country but the world at large
8368114 with his unprovoked and disastrous war of aggression in iraq and his monstrous deficits bush has set this country on a course that will take decades to correct
8368115 when future historians look back to identify the moment at which the united states began to lose its position of world leadership they will point rightly to the bush presidency thanks to his policies it is now easy to see america losing out to its competitors in any number of areas china is rapidly becoming the manufacturing powerhouse of the next century india the high tech and services leader and europe the region with the best quality of life
8368116 we would have an immigration policy that brings 12 million people out of the shadows

8368164 in europe they do it more the doctors will give the athletes an electrocardiogram and ask for the familys history along with a physical exam

8368168 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8368169 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8368170 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8368171 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8368172 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8368173 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8368174 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8368175 ok richie so when wall street comes back what areas are going to be hot for those who want to work in the financial services industry

8368286 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8368287 they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8368288 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in

8368296 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8368297 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8368298 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8368299 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8368320 my fusion of celebration and lamentation is addressed to all reader who care about misunderstanding and the skills required to achieve understanding
8368321 the concluding rescuers those who achieve most space are not surprisingly those who openly revived rhetorical terms and concepts they are the ones who have practiced a rhetoric of
8368322 even among the new celebrators of rhetorical studies many still treat it as only reflecting realities or truths derived by other methods but we universalists insist that if we think of reality as consisiting of any fact about the world including how we feel about it and we react to it it is clear that rhetoric makes a vast part of our realites

8368326 yes i really agree its stupid that we dont have a plan in this business and so and so has been promising to write it for years
8368327 no im too busy i dont have time for that ive got to run my business
8368328 planning isnt about writing some ponderous homework assignment or dull business memo its about envisioning the business that you want to create it should be fascinating to you what do people want how are you going to get it to them how are you different and what do you do better than anyone else
8368329 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8368330 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8368331 i dont want the cameras around stop the cameras get my mic give me two minutes to myself
8368332 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8368333 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8368334 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8368335 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8368336 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8368337 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8368338 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8368339 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8368340 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8368341 this renewal expresses nokias confidence in zi as a key supplier and opens the door for further opportunities to work with nokia on other projects
8368342 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8368343 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8368344 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8368345 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8368346 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8368347 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8368348 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8368349 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8368350 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8368351 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8368352 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8368353 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8368354 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8368355 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8368356 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8368357 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8368358 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8368359 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8368360 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8368361 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8368362 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8368363 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8368364 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8368365 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8368366 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8368367 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8368368 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8368369 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8368370 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8368371 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8368372 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8368373 byrd man paul byrd is 2 5 4 90 against the yankees in his career since 2007 he has throwing 14 innings against the yankees giving up 16 runs on 21 hits
8368374 im trying to put together an appropriate playlist to listen to during this evenings game with the sound off other than mozarts requiem depeche mode and the cure i am a little at a loss for material any ideas
8368375 heaven knows im miserable now is a great song for your playlist
8368376 the yankees have 35 home runs in august only the white sox 47 have more in baseball
8368377 yea i am wanting the great paul byrd he is another old piece of crap any fan who would want him on the team is a mo on
8368378 you get mad props for figuring out how to do an umlaut
8368379 since 2007 he has throwing 14 innings against the yankees giving up 16 runs on 21 hits
8368380 yeah moving giamsteroid down to 7th will make a difference
8368381 they are having a bad year it is not the apocolypse
8368382 the iron horse well not quite but this will be the 12th straight game jason giambi has played at first base thats his longest such streak since playing 19 straight from sept 1 20 2005 get into the groove a rod had one rbi in the last seven games
8368383 im trying to put together an appropriate playlist to listen to during this evenings game with the sound off other than mozarts requiem depeche mode and the cure i am a little at a loss for material any ideas
8368384 how hard of a concept is it to understand that no matter how much you bitch and moan about the 5 spot in the lineup giambi will still be there
8368385 im trying to put together an appropriate playlist to listen to during this evenings game with the sound off other than mozarts requiem depeche mode and the cure i am a little at a loss for material any ideas
8368386 ive probably said this 5 times before but it will apparently take the jaws of life to pry giambi from the 5 spot
8368387 when it counts you get your hopes up and way more often than not they smash those hopes to bits
8368388 imagine its september 1 2014 the yankees have still not won 27 the yanks are 8 games back from wild card contention
8368389 today we sucked i sucked i played terrible they hit balls all over the place down the corner at third base and i left men all over the field we win as a team and lose as a team tonight you can put it on me but im going to help this team win a lot of games too
8368390 imagine its september 1 2014 the yankees have still not won 27 the yanks are 8 games back from wild card contention arod comes up and hits his 763rd home run for the sake of this discussion barry bonds has not hit another what is the reaction
8368391 didnt carlos pena used to be in the yankee system youre welcome tampa yeah we made the right choice jason giambi i wanted him to stay that year too i remember how he was w oakland and then he hit his rock bottom you dont just forget to how to hit
8368392 imagine its september 1 2014 the yankees have still not won 27 the yanks are 8 games back from wild card contention arod comes up and hits his 763rd home run for the sake of this discussion barry bonds has not hit another what is the reaction
8368393 jeter and rivera have both been booed jeter was hitting 190 in june a few years ago and he heard it rivera was struggling in april last year and he heard it
8368394 people with the logic he has his money he does not care that is classic stupidity
8368395 do you think damon jeter and abreu sit and glare at a rod across the room
8368396 laura i think the boos are a result of frustration
8368397 you want to affect change stop going to the ballpark
8368398 its like booing in the forest if no one hears them no big deal
8368399 heres where you lose me ive been going to the ballpark for 45 years im dating myself its a link between my parents and i ive taken my kids to the ballpark since they were small its a link that my kids now have with me there are millions just like us we shouldnt be denied that just because our beloved team stinks in any given year
8368400 i think you misunderstood me its okay to boo at the tv or at the computer not okay to boo in person
8368401 until i win 5 world series with this team and have a world series clinching home run fans will never be completely satisfied with me and i know that
8368402 do any of you think that johnny damon regrets going for the money and becoming a yankee
8368403 ah now i figured out the comparison you see a guy like daniel cabrera a fireballing pitcher w great potential but he has a problem repeating his mechanics thats what happens to alex in the clutch
8368404 arod will get better once the hitter behind him gets better
8368405 hes been horrible this year but that doesnt mean hell be horrible the rest of his career
8368406 ive been to the stadium and its not like that in person
8368407 well they didnt win but at least he did his part
8368408 do you realize how much money and fame he is going to bring us
8368409 stop acting like youre entitled to see your team win championships all the time for most fans its a long time coming
8368410 al from bk statistics are fine and the poor hitting applies to just about everyone on that team whats disturbing is which a rod will show up the each of the next 9 years while being paid the highest yearly salary in the history of baseball
8368411 among his comments is that a rod has hit in the clutch his whole career
8368412 just listened to the girardi audio the media should stick to reporting on what happens and leave psychoanalysis to licensed professionals
8368413 mel not all the time but if my math is right im entitled to a championship once every for years so im expecting a back to back any momment now
8368414 using statistical facts to back up my unpopular opinion that a rod shouldnt be burnt at the stake like most people in here and in the media would like to do
8368415 i love how a rod hating is more popular than pokemon or tamigochi
8368416 there goes girardi lying again saying that a rod hit in the clutch his whole career
8368417 remember steve phillips suggested trading a rod for brandon mccarthy or sean marshall rich hill
8368418 now we see what this lineup would have been like without a rod
8368419 truly believe that when the yankees didnt improve with the addition of nady marte and i rod that the steinbrenners not publicly admitting it told cashman to forget about adding anyone put on waivers
8368420 checking out now but wanted to add to the collective playlist
8368421 using statistical facts to back up my unpopular opinion that a rod shouldnt be burnt at the stake like most people in here and in the media would like to do this year is just an ugly blip in yankees history everyone has underperformed with the exception of mo moose and damon
8368422 arods 303 career risp includes all the two run homers and rbi singles that came with a 7 run lead or a 7 run deficit
8368423 in the short term jason is just struggling period he no longer is a good hitter now a slugger whos career is coming to an end
8368424 well obviously calling the bunt wouldve been the right thing to do but as you saw in the last game damon cant bunt for hi amp
8368425 among his comments is that a rod has hit in the clutch his whole career
8368426 giambi still in the 5 hole ponson pitching and pudge catching this is not a recipe for success
8368427 ive been to the stadium and its not like that in person
8368428 so the stadium is quiet first time i ever heard that that whole paragraph reeks of stupidity have you ever been to any baseball games in your life ive been to my fair share of parks and no crowd is into the game like a yankee stadium crowd seriously what an ignorant and mornic statement do you have any idea of what youre talking about
8368429 id say this summer half the stadium are yankee fans the other half are visitors to them the stadium is just an item on a tour guide check list right along the david letterman show
8368430 casual fans whatever you want to call them are the ones that cheer every shallow flyball like its a certain home run
8368431 im saying that your entire comment is stupid and uninformed people are constantly on their feet and cheering whether a yankee pitcher is on the mound with a 2 strike count or one of our guys is up at the plate in a big spot basing all your assumptions on whats transpired over the last few games isnt much of a basis for your argument
8368432 im not attacking you personally im saying that your entire comment is stupid and uninformed
8368433 stick to your rick astley ill stick with the edgier stuff
8368434 why did nady short arm that ball hes a clutch hitter but stinks in the field
8368435 this team the yankees is going to get messed up tonight
8368436 how many years has it been since the yankees were this crappy
8368437 but is it bad when its only the first inning and im already wondering whos available in the bullpen
8368438 geez at this point i really dont care if they make the playoffs but id like to see at least one more classic yankee red sox match up before they leave the stadium
8368439 now that was way outside same spot ponson threw to and didnt get the call this is getting ridiculous
8368440 hey i hope someone figures out whether bobby was out on nesn because i wouldnt want people who wonder to be upset or something
8368441 we may have caught a break there he might have been safe
8368442 on gameday the damon pitch showed up in the other batters box
8368443 unless of course arod was following along with the comments all day
8368444 it was so far outside it should have been ball 4 for damon and ball 1 for jeter
8368445 i dont think pete dislikes arod i think its his job to point out the facts
8368446 anyway nice hustle by ponson if he cant pitch its good he can field
8368447 what are you going to write now maybe actual professional journalism
8368448 i dont think pete dislikes arod i think its his job to point out the facts
8368449 everyone realizes that the game is being played in yankee stadium and not in the psyches of lohud blog readers right
8368450 this however is the only reality that they know even though they are seeing merely shadows of objects they are thus conditioned to judge the quality of one another by their skill in quickly naming the shapes and dislike those who play poorly
8368451 what are you going to write now maybe actual professional journalism
8368452 why do i feel like this is a good ole greek tragedy where everyone ends up dead or worse cue sophocles

8368466 hey maybe you could leave some scraps for the rest of us
8368467 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8368468 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8368469 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8368470 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8368471 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8368472 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8368473 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8368474 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8368475 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8368476 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8368477 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8368478 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

8368510 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8368511 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8368512 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8368513 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8368514 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8368515 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8368560 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8368561 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8368562 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8368563 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes

8368670 making a public market for our shares will hopefully provide early investors who believed in our company from the beginning the benefit of increasing stock value and thats very gratifying and at the end of the day it was people who made this milestone possible not banks not politicians but people who believed in us and what we were doing
8368671 but it is equally relevant to human affairs including areas as diverse as religion economics and literature current trends in research and scholarship are not yet reflected in higher education evos was created to correct this imbalance

8368674 we dont want to give anyone the impression that storage is needed to integrate wind even growing 20 fold storage isnt needed
8368675 in the next couple of years we want to install a couple of them so it becomes a tool in the toolbox to meet needs
8368676 different sectors like to associate with wind power and if compressed air will truly help wind then fine
8368677 h ow do we blend these two seemingly opposite forces carbon trading can play a critical and perhaps earth changing role
8368678 you can make friedman proud and still save the planet
8368679 the system of nature of which man is a part tends to be self balancing self adjusting self cleansing not so with technology
8368680 will carbon credit trading and the green movement lead to the demise of milton friedmans philosophy not a chance we have entered into a time of awareness that our blue planet faces some serious challenges but the green movement combined with advances in technology and some smart investing offers economic opportunities worldwide keep your eyes open theres a movement afoot but friedmans economics will prevail

8368685 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8368686 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8368687 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8368688 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8368689 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8368690 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol
8368691 i challenge you to tackle this topic today looking down on the world from such a height that you could see the rooftops as though you were flying to see things from a distance instead of up close and personal

8368698 technologies born in the consumer internet such as search wikis and social networks have changed our lives outside of work its time to take those technologies and change our world of work
8368699 this is a very aware team and making everyone aware of a common set of goals is paramount to project success
8368700 my talk will be about what techniques sapient uses to help organizations promote and focus on project awareness

8368714 one month ago i was surfing celebrity entertainment websites performing stand up in front of small crowds and dreaming of what it would be like on the red carpet
8368715 after all that practice and preparation its still astounding that in just a few short weeks i will be living my dream job and making connections that could change my career forever
8368716 by partnering with people com for this co branded competition we have been able to break new ground in hollywood and offer the youtube community an all access pass to one of the hottest nights in entertainment
8368717 never before has an aspiring red carpet reporter had the opportunity to sidestep the velvet rope interview hollywood stars alongside veteran people com reporters and film the experience for their youtube fans we are proud to join forces with people com to offer one red carpet reporter the chance to fulfill her lifelong goal
8368718 we couldnt have been more pleased with the level of participation and excitement we saw from the youtube and people com communities
8368719 and we are all very excited to watch franchescas star turn on the red carpet in september
8368720 island life is precious and difficult enough to preserve in an age of youtube and cell phones were talking about a community that evokes memories of mayberry rfd where neighbors wander from porch to porch and the streets in summer are full of kids drawing with chalk and riding scooters this proposed commercial hotel will threaten that
8368721 too much development and then youve got too much traffic too much burden on the fragile island environment resulting in an overtaxed ecosystem and physical infrastructure
8368722 if you ask the people who actually live at diamond cove excluding those people who own homes for the predominant purposes of renting them out for a profit i believe youll find a majority oppose the project when you ask and include those in the cottage community i would not be surprised to find that nearly 75 of homeowners on the entire island oppose the project
8368723 stronger action is needed and thats what our group is about the city is rushing this through despite the potential for multiple conflicts of interest and dubious legal positions probably because it has a huge liability on its hands
8368724 this does not add homeowners to the island homeowners who watch out for each others kids who pick up trash when they see it who try to keep the noise down so they dont upset their neighbors but large groups of people for destination weddings business events and other on island happenings for transient visitors
8368725 if they were really concerned about what the families really want on the island they would work harder at talking to them
8368726 controlpath grc has been the ideal enterprise risk management framework to manage the compliance requirements for each of our business units

8368732 this november 11 marks the 90th anniversary of the end of the first world war and a time for canadians to remember the extraordinary sacrifices of our service men and women
8368733 supporting the restoration of memorials such the memorial park cenotaph is just one way that our government is ensuring that our veterans are honoured with the respect they so deserve
8368734 the memorial park cenotaph is an important landmark for the residents of north bay
8368735 we are so pleased to provide support to project flanders to help restore the cenotaph and ensure that it remains a powerful reminder of the sacrifices and achievements of all who served
8368736 the mere fact that the city of portland sought out and actively participated in the ongoing elections of a private condo association within the city limits to influence private property rules and regulations is itself a disconcerting action
8368737 the further fact that they used a tenuous and wrong legal foundation to do so is simply incredible
8368738 the participation of the city of portland in the voting processes of the dcha which resulted in the narrow approval of the commercial hotel project was clearly invalid
8368739 the dcha covenants are clear theres a strong question as to whether the city of portland had standing to cast its votes if the city had not cast these 23 votes the project would have died there since it only passed by a few votes
8368740 we want to be clear about one thing this is a joint effort by homeowners across the spectrum of great diamond island residents we have strong support from the cottage community as well as diamond cove homeowners that this commercial hotel development is not wanted and were prepared to fight it with this suit and other actions
8368741 we are in solidarity with all true islanders in the state when it comes to our concern about maintaining community in the face of escalating development driven by investors whose only interest in the island is financial
8368742 this is a small island and nothing happens here without impacting everyone like many others we moved to gdi for the quiet peace safety and natural beauty
8368743 it seems sacrilegious that the city of portland itself an entity that normally fights to protect unique aspects of maine history is pushing forward this hotel project in a residential historical neighborhood what youre seeing here is an island population that wants to preserve the island experience as it is now and this is our first step towards that goal
8368744 the main reason was i went through very strenuous round of chemo i went through it twice and we found out it was still contained in the one area but it wasnt doing any good
8368745 and we exhausted everything we could to keep the leg but at the end of the day it wasnt working and the only other option was to amputate
8368746 its been on me for like a year and a half trying to decide what to do here so yes im at peace and my family has come to grips with it and its a tough thing but we cant sit here and mope about it you know youve got to move on and stay positive i remain positive and you know everything else is going to work itself out
8368747 gods been doing the driving all the time so i cant act like ive been doing the driving anyway so its one of those things that ive got to put my trust in him
8368748 the good thing about it is it was an above the knee amputation so ill be fitted for a prosthesis and ill be able to be highly functional drive myself around
8368749 i got an email first day of school which is great i love when parents stay in contact i like that
8368750 everything can you tell my kid to ride home with his aunt can you send home extra work and when can i come volunteer in classroom all those things i get emails about
8368751 every time i come back from school she seems kind of curious what i do and when i come back she usually e mails my teachers
8368752 well they are definitely going to be able to stay on top of it better if they can go online and see how kids are doing see if their grades are starting to slip or maybe not turning assignments in they can help their kids
8368753 thats probably cool for me because i usually get good grades or mom really needs to check on lucas grades my little brother
8368754 ive already graduated from high school and i graduated from college theres nothing you can do to hurt me anymore
8368755 how can you ever expect to get any good movies to shoot if you keep shooting shit like this
8368756 last time i saw you you shot me in the bollocks
8368757 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
8368758 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
8368759 sign up for scouting night has become a highly anticipated evening for parents who want the convenience of registering their sons and daughters in boy scouts and girl scouts at one location
8368760 these two are basically the only ones that service jails of 300 beds and less
8368761 we thought itd be great if we could use the same service as the el dorado correctional facility and they had no interest in bidding
8368762 i guess im down to the point then that i would ask you all to allow us to seek a contract with ach advanced correctional healthcare
8368763 we typically average 55 to 60 for the last three to four years
8368764 i didnt refigure it because i would be shocked if it stayed at 75
8368765 most of the people that are out there now they want to go with a new company
8368766 they want to maintain the job and they the company shared with us that they would not lower the salaries of the people that are there
8368767 in the smaller counties like wilson county its very hard to hire people period
8368768 id have a hard time arguing financially why we wouldnt
8368769 the building was part of the leon district and closed last year

8368784 they dont want to recognize the existence of art in our society and thats appalling
8368785 im here with all my peers to say no we exist and culture is an essential good
8368786 culture is the expression of a people of a nation
8368787 attacking it like the tories are doing shows they are ideologically short sighted
8368788 thats dangerous we cant allow politicians to determine what is written what is seen what dances are allowed what songs are tolerable
8368789 i hope it has a determining effect on the harper government
8368790 if there are federal elections im going to get involved and im sure i wont be the only one

8368798 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8368799 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8368800 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8368801 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8368802 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

8368861 maybe youre at an internet kiosk and dont want the next person using it to know at which web site you bank
8368862 the most likely situation is the obvious one nudge nudge wink wink say no more
8368863 the enterprise is more concerned with keeping user information guarded from untrusted web sites than making sure your off business internet habits are kept secret
8368864 the features so far described by microsoft seem to fall more squarely into the paranoid spouse category aka what has been coined porn mode
8368865 if you happen to browse to sites that refer to the same third party resource i e a script image stylesheet information is sent to that third party
8368866 over time the third party can create a profile of which web sites you go to what links you click on etc
8368867 historically microsoft has done a good job of giving enterprise security teams a fair amount of configuration control of applications from within
8368868 essentially if written policy states that all browsing history is kept then more than likely the enterprise will be given the ability to disable the inprivate mode

8368877 so is it necessary to listen to those right thinking people or should we seek dialogue without discrimination even going so far as to sit down at a table with al qaeda leader bin laden
8368878 what should be done when individuals groups or states violate international law and its principles what are the legitimate means of political action and what should be ruled out
8368879 there is a risk of damaged credibility but for calmy rey rather than for switzerland she could have said exactly the same thing in a different way
8368880 she calmy rey asked the rhetorical question of whether entering into a dialogue with bin laden would be considered as a possibility she did not state that she would promote such a dialogue nor has she proposed such a dialogue
8368881 in practice there is no question of the foreign ministry proposing a dialogue with osama bin laden
8368882 should she not have anticipated that such provocation would make ink flow that she would provoke misunderstandings and even tensions
8368883 calmy is no master of diplomacy she has managed yet again to distract from the substance set off a storm about the style and make switzerland look odd abroad

8368913 bachelet promulga convenci n internacional sobre derechos de los discapacitados
8368914 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8368915 good but with that black gllomy background i can never become a regular reader and im a nat
8368916 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8368917 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables

8368926 those who will suffer are the very people that the legislation intended to protect
8368927 it is a pity that the leadership in national international and governmental agencies people that are not really in the know as to what takes place on the ground failed to consult our association on this issue and to our knowledge no collateral damage study was undertaken

8368963 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8368964 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system

8369017 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created

8369180 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8369181 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8369215 una pietra miliare posta sul lungo e difficile cammino del genere umano
8369216 una delle pi alte espressioni della coscienza umana nel nostro tempo
8369217 la dichiarazione del 1948 non presenta i fondamenti antropologici ed etnici dei diritti delluomo che essa proclama
8369218 su questo anniversario pesano tuttavia le ombre di alcune riserve manifestate circa due caratteristiche essenziali della nozione stessa di diritti delluomo la loro universalit e la loro indivisibilit

8369258 we chose to support this exceptionally talented young woman at a forum like difw because she has an incredible flair for fashion and will be a role model for other aspiring young talented artists in the region our commitment to the region is not only in terms of promoting mobility but in nurturing inspiring and enabling people to explore their talents and their creativity
8369259 this was an incredible opportunity to showcase my prism line especially to such a receptive and supportive audience the sheer inventiveness of nokias prism the design the colours the texture and the patterns were an incredible inspiration that fitted with my personal taste and preference of modern and individualist styles that fit with a womans unique fashion taste factors like the geometric lines and contrasting materials on the prism gave a lot of scope for designing pieces that were modern almost futuristic but still elegant
8369260 the fact a mobile phone has inspired such an incredibly creative fashion collection highlights the originality in the design of our nokia devices

8369295 obama and ayers both attended some 1995 board meetings of the chicago annenberg challenge which ayers was instrumental in starting and obama chaired in the 1990s ayers was part of the groups operational arm the chicago school reform collaborative which reviewed proposals for challenge grants and made recommendations to the board according to the organizations early documents during a june 1995 meeting ayers was credited with having worked diligently to support the board and the collaborative according to meeting minutes but more than a year later obama pushed the group to be bolder in its reforms minutes from an october 1996 gathering show obama a guest at a meeting of the collaborative raised questions about what the group should be doing the minutes characterized obamas concerns as twofold whether the group was raising additional money and whether money was being used to prop up existing organizations as opposed to creating fresh educational practices in the schools at the end of five years will we have broken the mold not much seems to be bubbling up that is inspiring or substantive the minutes say paraphrasing obama
8369296 chicago annenberg challenge was awarded nearly 50 million in the 1990s the money was part of ambassador walter h annenbergs 500 million challenge to the nation whereby public private partnerships tried to improve public schools according to the annenberg institutes web site obama has said he deplored what ayers did in the 1960s and that by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education

8369307 the right to request flexible working has worked well because it helps employees to balance their home and work lives but at the same time gives employers the right to say no where there are legitimate business concerns

8369309 the new suttie centre for teaching and learning in healthcare will be an exceptional addition to the foresterhill health campus that we share with nhs grampian this new development symbolises our joint commitment to excellence to the highest quality of education and professional development of healthcare practitioners of all disciplines and to delivering very real benefits for our local communities
8369310 this facility provides a unique opportunity to build on aberdeens excellent reputation as a centre for training it is a wonderful boost not just for the academic reputation of the north east but for the nhs in grampian and beyond and will enhance the preparation of future generations of medical and healthcare students of many disciplines
8369311 we are delighted to have reached this major milestone on schedule the project team led by richard hore technical manager and scott walker project manager has worked well together on this exciting development and we now look forward to the final delivery of the building which will be a credit to aberdeen and the north east
8369312 one of the central issues in nanotechnology is the development of simple and reliable methods to precisely arrange molecules and other nanoscopic objects one promising route intensively investigated by scientists around the world involves the ability of molecules to spontaneously assemble onto a surface what we have done is successfully combined two strategies which are complementary but so far have been explored independently and it is this combination which opens up unprecedented opportunities for accessing the ultrasmall length scale
8369313 the potential of this approach lies in its flexibility on a scale about 1 10000 of the diameter of a human hair using molecules as building units the features of our structures are less than 5 nanometres in size which enables us to control structures and materials at dimensions where new properties emerge
8369314 we are just at the beginning of the exploration of a very exciting new area ongoing and future work will investigate changes in the dimensions and geometry of the network where the aim is to get exact control over the arrangement of molecules ultimately at the level of single molecules
8369315 in the short term this development provides us with an easily accessible platform for fundamental studies of phenomena on the ultrasmall scale
8369316 in the future we might be able to use this technology for the assembly of nanomachines molecular devices used to transport and manipulate molecules and nanometer sized objects
8369317 you never really know what is going on there not really
8369318 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8369319 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8369320 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years
8369321 many consumers incorrectly believe that the only way to protect themselves from skin damage caused by the sun is to apply sunscreens
8369322 the labeling being proposed today strengthens the existing labeling for sunscreens by educating consumers on the added importance of limiting their time in the sun and wearing protective clothing as part of a sun protection regimen
8369323 we applaud the important human rights and civic work of the lao movement for human rights lmhr in france and internationally and welcome the efforts of key members of the european parliament to pursue additional independent research and monitoring of the horrific and catastrophic situation facing the laotian and hmong people who are being persecuted imprisoned and killed by the lpdr regime
8369324 many policymakers in washington d c the european parliament and in the international community continue to be deeply concerned about the institutional violence that continues under the lpdr military junta and the plight of the jailed lao student leaders who peacefully protested in vientiane laos in october of 1999 but were brutally arrested and jailed by the lpdr military and security forces

8369328 it just makes me upset because hillary would have been the perfect woman to do this job
8369329 im a democrat first but its just difficult to get over
8369330 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8369331 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8369332 we really are taking a position of being indifferent to obama
8369333 to be honest that would make this whole thing a lot easier

8369351 yang jias abnormal behavior is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8369352 some raised the issue of why he did it so this got into bigger issue of maybe there were injustices carried out by the shanghai police
8369353 thats where i think authorities would not want this case to go
8369354 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance

8369357 i think she did what she had to do but i didnt feel any enthusiasm
8369358 what it did was it reminded us how incredibly strong a candidate she still is on that stage
8369359 but hillarys speech reminded me that im not a republican and im not excited about voting republican tonight reminded me that i am still a democrat at heart
8369360 you never gave in and you never gave up and together we made history
8369361 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8369362 were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8369363 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8369364 as i recall we did it before with president clinton and the democrats and if we do our part well do it again with president obama and the democrats
8369365 youre not going to undo a months long primary campaign with one speech but its a beginning
8369366 i dont think barack obama would be anywhere near where he is today if it wasnt for the igniting of his campaign by young people
8369367 i think were going to have the best turnout of young voters ever
8369368 i first got involved in politics by volunteering for college democrats i was fortunate because at that time there was a lot going on
8369369 i feel a sense of pride of being a delegate from wi and from uw madison make sure everyone knows that is where i am from
8369370 i am proud that we have been known in the past as a purple state and know are known as a blue state whatever stereotypes people had about wi i hope when they see our delegation it all goes away
8369371 my dad has been involved with democratic politics since i can remember but when i really got involved in it was when i saw obama speak in 2004 in milwaukee i was in high school at the time and had a really good government politics teacher and he really got me involved
8369372 awais went to the same high school i did and i have always looked up to him i think he really good things for the party and i think he is a really good person
8369373 locally i also look up to tammy baldwin russ feingold and jim doyle
8369374 i though she said exactly what she needed to say she got us all united last night i think it was an overall really good speech

8369379 when we began the development of visonac we were seeking to provide a much improved treatment option for patients with moderate to severe acne the results from these two studies clearly highlight that we are well on our way to achieving this goal the fact that we have been able to deliver good efficacy results with visonac while at the same time reducing pain and redness will be of major benefit to patients the second study which has demonstrated that we can simplify the overall treatment procedure with visonac while delivering equivalent efficacy is expected to help increase the penetration of visonac pdt into the overall acne market we look forward to confirming these positive findings in our phase iii program for visonac
8369380 there are strong reasons why judges should treat public disobedients more leniently than ordinary offenders and not only when their objections to law or policy are well founded
8369381 unlike radical protesters or ordinary offenders public disobedients are conscientiously motivated
8369382 often their protests serve the interests of society by forcing a necessary reexamination of moral boundaries
8369383 when breakdowns in the mechanisms for citizen engagement in the decision making process occur public disobedience offers one way to rectify these democratic deficits by focusing attention on a neglected issue
8369384 i hope to show that principled or public motivations generally lessen the seriousness of a breach of law even when the cause championed through the disobedience is poorly founded
8369385 i wish to test my belief that legal defenses such as a demands of conscientious excuse should be available not only for private conscientious objection but also for suitably constrained public disobedience

8369388 thanks to the national curriculum and holocaust memorial day the demand for knowledge and interpretation has never been so high
8369389 the fascinating input of norbert herz as well as the other contributors will give teachers the materials to effectively bring this information to their pupils
8369390 this event will provide accurate tools to educators to deal with teaching the holocaust in the classroom and to the local government authorities who organise annual holocaust memorial day events
8369391 it will also acquaint these 80 teachers and educators with some of the newest research on the holocaust
8369392 we need to understand how such a thing could happen to prevent it from happening again
8369393 relying on subjective memory has its place but that is not enough we need to make strong and continuing efforts to understand the facts
8369394 but listening to witnesses is crucial and norbert herz will be the first to talk in our program
8369395 materials like cartoons diaries and carefully selected pictures are useful for younger children as it s important not to shock them but still bring the issues to their attention
8369396 perhaps most importantly the students must be able to express what they are feeling by talking about it

8369398 in other words it is supposed to be okay that christians run around this country like mdma powered termites yapping about values and the family and decreeing
8369399 it is known that the only appropriate family situation for a child is when there are two parents one of each gender

8369403 now if you find my approach to be patronizing and or insulting for different reasons so be it
8369404 members have taken this step reluctantly but it has to be seen against a policy of real cuts in staffing that has meant the quality of our publications suffer for readers and advertisers alike
8369405 johnston press continues to make big profits from milton keynes at the expense of its staff who as anyone who knows us will appreciate show real commitment in providing our city with the best free newspaper in the country
8369406 and like everyone in milton keynes we face higher housing costs and mortgages council tax fuel and utility prices
8369407 this is a modest pay claim and we still hope it can be settled quickly and satisfactorily
8369408 journalists at the citizen feel sorely let down by management
8369409 our members went into the christmas period with some hope that this long running issue could be resolved yet the new year response from management has been wholly negative
8369410 such an unconstructive attitude is particularly disappointing given that milton keynes is one of the most profitable centres for johnston press

8369524 senator mccain believes that we do not need to raise taxes to do this
8369525 simply said as a matter of opening negotiation everything can be on the table
8369526 historically changes to taxes in social security have been phased in over time
8369527 that avoids the problem of bloating the social security trust fund so that congress thinks it can spend the money elsewhere
8369528 the reality is if a payroll tax increase is not good now its not good ever

8369535 we need to be looking at ways to increase the number of foster homes and adoptive homes and not discriminate on sexual orientation or marital status
8369536 the need as is the consensus among other state child welfare agencies and the child welfare league of america that the division of children and family services arkansas department of human services should have the responsibility and flexibility to decide which foster and adoptive homes are most appropriate for each childs placement on a case by case basis
8369537 not to promote the health safety and welfare of foster children but rather was based upon the boards views of morality and its bias against homosexuals
8369538 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
8369539 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible

8369564 i think barack obama has contiunously throughout this campaign displayed his lack of knowledge and his lack of experience about foreign policy
8369565 to describe iran as a tiny country that doesnt pose any threat
8369566 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8369567 and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet
8369568 when sen mccain does it it becomes a major issue in the press
8369569 i dont think it translates necessarily into foreign policy or national security expertise

8369571 es algo alcanzable pero hay que trabajar duro para lograrlo
8369572 la prioridad es participar cada vez m s en torneos grandes
8369573 tengo todas las condiciones para entrenarme y pronto entrar en una etapa de madurez en mi carrera

8369575 yo creo que hay un buen equipo he visto partidos y lo m s importante del juego es el futbolista y nosotros tenemos futbolistas ahora lo que hay que encontrar es el camino para que respondan como corresponde y as enriquezcan el potencial del equipo
8369576 los jugadores deben asumir la responsabilidad en la cancha y no dejarse llevar por dos o tres gritos que no corresponden

8369583 esto a n no se ha acabado seguir luchando para conseguir los resultados que quiero todav a queda un tercio del campeonato y eso es suficiente para contraatacar
8369584 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8369585 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8369586 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8369587 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8369588 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8369589 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all

8369600 la operaci n me rompi porque ven a jugando muy bien era el 11 del mundo y el 6 de la race y fue un palo pero las cosas vienen as y ahora tengo que tratar recuperar el nivel de principio de la temporada
8369601 ven a sacando muy bien antes de la operaci n en roland garros tuve el r cord de aces y aqu he empezado sacando tambi n bastante bien es un aspecto de mi juego que he tratado de mejorar sobre todo de cara a los grand slams porque son partidos a cincos sets y cuando mejor saques m s puntos tienes gratis y ahorras esfuerzos

8369604 es extraordinario porque todos sabemos como es un t o muy cercano y ha demostrado que es mucho mejor persona que tenista ha estado luchando mucho por llegar a ese objetivo y ahora mismo esta escribiendo historia del tenis espa ol
8369605 tengo decidido retirarse de la mejor forma posible ya que esta es mi ltima temporada en el f tbol de elite
8369606 el perfecto final ganar todos los t tulos en juego la premier carling cup fa cup y la liga de campeones eso es lo que me gustar a pero con dos de ellos me conformo

8369621 right and left height sensors also aid performance reducing the risk of cargo collapse or damage when driving around corners or over uneven road surfaces the benefits of this feature are compounded in cases where the freight is loaded to one side a common scenario where multiple drops are involved
8369622 isuzu estimates that the four bag air suspension reduces vibration shocks within the vehicle cargo area to as little as one quarter of that experienced within an equivalent steel suspended truck
8369623 while in the cabin vibration levels are reduced by up to two thirds

8369642 para nosotros cada partido es importante fue un encuentro de reclasificaci n pero sabemos de la importancia que tuvo se mostr que el equipo tiene las mismas ganas que en el campeonato local se mostr seriedad y el resultado fue factor de esto
8369643 se mostr que la idea del equipo era ganar e incluso se pudieron convertir muchos goles lo importante es que se gan los j venes que jugaron no desentonaron y sirve para que cada elemento que jug vaya ganando m s confianza sabiendo que el pr ximo s bado tenemos un partido muy importante contra necaxa
8369644 se demostr que cualquiera est para jugar fue un partido donde fuimos superiores porque no se dej de correr durante todo el juego

8369646 por ah debemos mejorar para que no nos sorprendan con goles en el primer tiempo tratar de tener la iniciativa de marcar los goles es algo que todos debemos manejar nos sorprende a todos no estar metidos al principio y despu s como que despertamos y hemos tenido la suerte de revertir los marcadores estamos mostrando buenas cosas

8369697 ensuring democracy delivers real dividends a perspective from former presidents and prime ministers
8369698 now in fairness he went on to say perhaps mindful of how his off the cuff remarks might have been taken this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8369699 its pretty hard to believe it doesnt have anything to do with whats going on now
8369700 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for

8369703 we have seen reports that there are atrocities being committed against civilians
8369704 and we want to call on the russians to allow a credible investigation to take place of reports that atrocities have been committed by both sides

8369712 we prefer to focus on our own initiatives to enhance diversity and inclusiveness in our workplace
8369713 with all leagues on any given cycle it can turn out that way or it can turn out that a disproportionate percentage were coaches of color that were hired
8369714 it means so much to be home but also to see how warm the reception has been and how much interest there has been
8369715 everyone had a fantastic time many more people came along than we had expected and it was perfect opportunity to welcome the medallists back i think people will be talking about it for quite a long time
8369716 the huge turnout at the royal mile is a sign of how proud edinburgh people are of our athletes and of the massive impact that chris hoy has made on the global stage
8369717 ha yeah i told him i talked to the person who put the note on his car
8369718 he said i knew it was her but everybody at work knows about the whole note and two people know who it is they think youre pretty awesome but he did tell me he has a girlfriend you just came at the wrong time he thinks youre real cool for doing that though
8369719 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8369720 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it

8369724 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8369725 we were fighting the church the couch and the courts
8369726 nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner why not discard the hermitage for the heritage that awaits any red blooded american woman who dares to claim it

8369734 opens the door to moving the case forward so the county can force the industry to reveal its charging practices which are governed by a contract with the federal government
8369735 disagree with the courts decision and willl consider the next step including the possibility of further appeals
8369736 confident it will prevail if the case goes forward because it did not overcharge and
8369737 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8369738 in all international institutions we will need to review our relations with russia
8369739 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8369740 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8369741 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8369742 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8369743 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8369744 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8369745 for every page of rfp you send out you get two in return
8369746 ich hoffe dass mit der strafe ein zeichen gesetzt wird denn das hat mit fu ball nichts zu tun

8369748 man sollte jetzt nicht alle fans in einen korb schmei en aber gegen diese handvoll muss man schon hart vorgehen weil es so im
8369749 one often heard especially from priests that one cannot live on nothing but presently these priests manage to do just that christianity does not exist and yet they live on it
8369750 they plainly did not know how to treat me but behaved like persons
8369751 we are currently notifying all participating clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies that enrollment of new patients into vital 2 has been suspended as has treatment with gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer of patients enrolled in the study
8369752 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8369753 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8369754 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8369755 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8369756 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8369757 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8369758 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8369759 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8369760 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8369761 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8369762 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8369763 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8369764 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8369765 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8369766 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serio us threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world
8369767 the next time that i hear carl edwards tell me that hes going to make me bleed he better be ready to do it right then and there i dont care what the fine is from nascar ive got 50 000 saved
8369768 i think carl has a little more age a little more maturity on his side its not taking anything away from kyle but i think carl has just been there done that a few more times ive all along said i would put the championship if i was to see the championship i would go off the experience and hes won more championships and on down the line and with that kind of ranking system in my eyes carl would be a step ahead of kyle but everyone needs to win their first and there are going to be guys out there breaking records and kyle has done that this year so its tough to really say in my opinion carl is a little more laid back kyle seems to be a little more high strung from time to time but that doesnt tilt it one way or the other
8369769 but if you watch him race carl drives a lot like dale earnhardt sr carl gives you two laps and then he nudges you out of the way i mean carl edwards runs into more people during a race than anybody hes as aggressive as tony or dale but i think he is so politically correct when he gets out he gets away with it
8369770 people kept asking what kind of music theyd hear on this next album whether it was going to be r amp b pop country or rock and i seemed to keep saying the same thing its going to be a little bit of everything i guess
8369771 there are some issues that still need to be worked out
8369772 the increasing world wide acceptance and u s investors increasing ownership of foreign companies make it plain that if we do nothing and simply let these trends develop comparability and transparency will decrease for u s investors and issuers
8369773 shift the burden of the translation between the two accounting languages onto investors
8369774 theres every reason to believe theyll choose the language that paints their financials in the rosiest light
8369775 will likely inflate the earnings of u s companies and mislead investors
8369776 the idea was conceived by prof jhunjhunwala of in the course of an exploratory project focused on using ict to deliver modern banking services to rural india
8369777 it was found that branch based banking is too expensive to be extended to remote rural locations where the volume and size of transactions are small using conventional atms automatic teller machines as a channel posed many difficulties because these atms were not built to operate in illiterate environments hence the need for developing an atm specific to this context
8369778 vortex developed a beltless dispenser design that in many ways mimics the way a human teller would pick and count notes
8369779 we are running pilots for two leading banks with about 10 atms
8369780 though it is still early the initial response has been very encouraging rural users find fingerprint authentication intuitive and simple and the atm convenient and easy to use a few users also gave feedback that our atms look less intimidating maybe because it is placed in a non air conditioned room with easy access and also is different in shape from a typical atm
8369781 the atms were tested for extended operating cycles under the harshest of environments that would prevail in the rural context using soiled currencies operating in non air conditioned and dusty environments subjecting the machine to typical fluctuations in line voltages and power outages user acceptance was tested by enlisting the participation of rural and semi urban people to carry out test transactions
8369782 there is combat every day in this province and that isnt going to end any time soon
8369783 we are going to stay in the fight and we have to stay active in order to prevail and not lose the initiative to the insurgents
8369784 do we have enough soldiers and policemen to control this province at this time the answer is no
8369785 this blatant disregard for human life is simply not acceptable
8369786 i am happy to report we that we have had very few civilian casualties as a result of our operations in kandahar province this year
8369787 we deeply regret any accidental loss of life that occurs as a result of our actions
8369788 the raid destroyed one of the largest ied factories to date within zhari panjwaii and seriously disrupted the insurgents ability to produce and deploy improvised explosive devices
8369789 there is no doubt many lives have been saved as a result of these operations
8369790 let me be clear we do expect further attacks you dont have to look very hard to find proof that there are serious challenges to security across afghanistan
8369791 i am cloud computing because my mail is now on gmail zomg

8369795 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8369796 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8369797 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8369798 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8369799 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8369800 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8369801 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8369802 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8369803 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8369804 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8369805 if the dems cant agree on their nominee why should i vote for him
8369806 he was cut on the back of his head blood was coming out the side of his mouth and his lip was cut
8369807 o j hit the cupboard hard and the glass shattered all over him he fell to the floor bleeding

8369810 john kerry has been disowned by the very men he served with in vietnam
8369811 john kerry 30 years ago he tried to pass himself off as an anti war radical now hes trying to pass himself off as a defender of america so was he lying then or lying now
8369812 i respect pres bush and believe hes done a great job protecting america there have not been any terrorist attacks since 9 11 thanks to his aggressive anti terrorism measures but i am my own man and have repeatedly stood my own ground especially with the surge
8369813 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some

8369818 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
8369819 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
8369820 i think it was just coachs decision just to kind of limit me on some of the stuff we were doing to try to make sure were not putting too much into it and making sure im still going towards that 100 percent
8369821 its probably still a little bit sore from it but hes moving well and hes throwing well hes had a couple of really good days of practice
8369822 i havent been told anything as of right now and im kind of going to see how it goes tomorrow
8369823 we have meetings tonight and im sure ill know more about it by that point and again im trying to get better and im trying to get healthy im very very concerned with our game a week from sunday and thats kind of where im at right now
8369824 if the coaches want me in there and they want me playing thats the attitude im taking right now
8369825 im happy to be a part of this team im happy im getting healthy right now and thats kind of my mindset
8369826 internet gambling represents the most invasive and addictive form of gambling in our history
8369827 this is a small victory in our determined effort to educate both sides of the aisle that there is a true constituency in america that values its internet freedoms
8369828 millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families we support legislation prohibiting gambling over the internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are participating in competitive sports
8369829 a mi no me va a consolar recuperar los restos de mi hijo
8369830 la problem tica de la adopci n es tan extensa que contar con una prueba de adn de tu hijo es algo que no est entre mis prioridades
8369831 es una manera de prevenir que ocurra algo malo pero yo no me planteo que le pueda pasar algo malo a mi hijo
8369832 en un jersey un cabello o en el cepillo de dientes saliva
8369833 la idea de casar nuestro adn con el de nuestros hijos adoptivos nos parece interesante
8369834 porque no la ven como algo vital y porque los precios no son demasiado baratos
8369835 sirve para toda la vida ya que el adn no cambia
8369836 es lo mismo que ocurre con los seguros de vida
8369837 por ejemplo una casa en la que haya varios ni os y se puedan mezclar los adn en ese caso ser a muy dif cil identificar a la persona en el caso de que haya una cat strofe como la de barajas
8369838 se lo hemos planteado a varias pero no est n muy por la labor se interesan un poco al principio pero nunca llegamos a nada
8369839 but i had a goal with the team before the season started and im sticking to it
8369840 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8369841 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8369842 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8369843 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8369844 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8369845 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8369846 the days he practiced out here was going 100 percent he looked like shawne merriman to me
8369847 it is going to be something he has to manage i see him going out and playing playing on first and second downs and playing on third downs and rushing the passer if managing it means reducing his snaps at different times or picking specific situations where he doesnt need to be on the field that is what we will do
8369848 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for viper
8369849 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8369850 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8369851 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8369852 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8369853 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8369854 they can move on and get a student loan and get their first apartment and move on with their lives
8369855 people recognize that there are a lot better things we could be doing with our police resources
8369856 ich nehme den schmerz von dir wir sind vom selben stern

8369860 we are obviously leprous that is why the pm refused to meet us
8369861 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8369862 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8369863 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election i thought she was outstanding

8369871 il ma fallu longtemps pour me d cider me mettre chanter
8369872 il fallait que je trouve quelque chose qui me motive
8369873 understanding the behavior of these individuals the super sharers helps us understand how to motivate them to support brands and hopefully grow this behavior among those who are less involved
8369874 excuse me i dont mean to be rude or offend you but may i ask you a question
8369875 you know that you have the option to order kosher meals on this airline
8369876 what do you mean you dont eat kosher do you mean that in the house you keep kosher and out of the house you just eat anything or is it just not an important mitzva for you to observe
8369877 none of the above i dont eat kosher and i choose to do it because g d said that we should and anything that g d says i just do the complete opposite
8369878 that was the final straw i endured everything with equanimity until finally one day i broke the entire time in the camps i had one goal to see the liberation with my son kasriel menachem his mother was long gone as were his brothers and sisters but we were going to survive i was sure of it one day the entire prisoner population was summoned to the assembly area for a special roll call there was number of trapdoors on the platform to accommodate several simultaneous hangings during this tirade my sons hand was squeezing my arm so hard that he almost cut off my circulation we all stampeded to get out of the line of fire and then my son and i were separated in the frenzy i never saw his face again later i heard from others who knew us that he had been pulled aside by a soldier and was shot
8369879 g d says have children and i did and they were all taken away so now whatever g d tells me to do i do the opposite he says keep kosher i eat treife he says honor the sabbath i go out in my car work and do not want to observe any of the commandments whatever he says i do the exact opposite
8369880 here we meet again isnt it funny how life will bring people together to meet and they wonder why not seeing the reason and the purpose behind it then years later they cross paths once again and perhaps the next time around they are able to realize why they had to meet im sure you know that today is yom kippur and they are about to have the yizkor service mention the names of those who have passed away come with me so you can also mention your sons name who died for the sake of kiddush hashem sanctifying hashems name and pray for his departed soul this might be your only chance for your sons name to be remembered dont you think that its time for his soul to be mentioned in the heavenly court
8369881 our kind father in heaven is expecting me to make a switch a turn a u you turn
8369882 yes i am blind and i can drive my own goddamn car thank you
8369883 move over david duke theres a new racist going for the oval office hillary supporters have seen obama unfairly play the race card time and time again in fact obamas crypto ethnic inflammatory remarks have become the senators number one method of distracting voters from his lack of qualifications numerous flip flops and dangerous associations

8369984 the xen org community has made security and performance key criteria for the evolution of xen
8369985 this has been a successful strategy according to recent yankee group survey data showing xens rapid growth
8369986 at intel we continue to enable xen to take advantage of the advancements in intel virtualization technologies and other platform capabilities
8369987 xen 3 3 is optimized for intels next generation micro architecture nehalem features enhanced power management performance i o and networking features for building flexible resource management solutions in an energy efficient data center
8369988 xen has become an open source industry standard for virtualization because it leads the industry in performance and support for leading server and pc systems
8369989 our open development model support for industry standard management apis and our open active engagement with the security community to secure the hypervisor ensure that xen continues to outclass proprietary hypervisors xen 3 3 further extends our communitys lead through significant performance efficiency and security enhancements and through groundbreaking features for embedded xen implementations on pcs laptops and pdas
8369990 by using the xen hypervisor included in suse linux enterprise 10 our customers obtain real business value with better use of hardware and significant reductions in maintenance and licensing costs

8369993 we applaud xen orgs efforts to fully leverage the support of the xen community and we look forward to continuing to support the development of the xen code
8369994 the xen project is a great success story of the open source movement
8369995 it just two years xen has rapidly gained share in virtualization much as linux did in operating systems and in the same period xen has driven the price of competing hypervisors to zero allowing any vendor to include virtualization for free customers should be aware that simply having a hypervisor is not a value proposition in itself and that they can now freely choose from multiple vendors that offer powerful value added features that deliver a secure available and dynamic virtual data center the communitys commitment to a single open source reference standard for virtualization is extremely powerful and we all owe a debt to those who have contributed to xens success
8369996 fujitsu is proud of our contribution to the development of xen 3 3 which marks another step forward in the evolution of the xen hypervisor
8369997 we recognize the growing importance of highly scalable and secure virtualization technology in enterprises today to this end fujitsu is also excited to be the key sponsor at the first xen summit in tokyo later this year
8369998 ibm is a strong supporter of the open source community and has a long history with virtualization having invented it for mainframe over 40 years ago
8369999 with that background ibm is pleased to work with xen as a key partner particularly as our clients continue moving to highly virtualized environments and cloud computing
